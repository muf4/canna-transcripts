[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while we're still stalling,
I should tell you that the last time I was
[SPEAKER_03]: here in 2013, I gave the talk about
Barbara McClintock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told you that I was going to publish
this book on her publications,
[SPEAKER_03]: perspectives on all of her publications,
and reprint all of the papers,
[SPEAKER_03]: the early papers that hadn't been
collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a digital book, and it's two
volumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to get my plug in for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had time.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology, isn't it wonderful?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I call this the micro and
macroevolution of Cornell's Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Breeding, because I feel that the
original talk that we gave was evolution
[SPEAKER_03]: of Cornell's Plant Breeding Department,
centennial history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt that there were certain things
that sort of flowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think of cytogenetics,
which I think about, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about evolution in a small way,
small changes, but then macroevolution in
[SPEAKER_03]: big jumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I want you to do as I go
through this today is think about the big
[SPEAKER_03]: jumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened that made major changes in
our department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'll probably point out a few
things, and then you can tell me what you
[SPEAKER_03]: think are the major macroevolutionary
changes that occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to dedicate this talk to Dr.
Murphy and Dr. Anderson, Dr. Pardee,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Dr. Provine, who we all lost in the
past few years since the centennial,
[SPEAKER_02]: which makes me really sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me, as they said, if I hit this,
it'll go forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the department originated, it was
started by Bailey, L.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bailey right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1907, Bailey was the founder of the
College of Agriculture in 1903.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted to start a new department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he appointed, in those days we didn't
do searches.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just found the best person and you got
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he appointed or asked Herbert J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weber to head this new department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Weber got here, he founded the
Synapses Club in 1907.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Synapses Club, I feel,
is our microevolutionary thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That holds us together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the faculty, and the
students, and the staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did everything together,
worked together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a synapses of all the
groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love about, and I'm so
glad that it's still going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Weber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about Weber when you have a
Synapses Club meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who was this person?
[SPEAKER_03]: Herbert John Weber.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was head of the department from 1907 to
1912.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was, at the time, the most notable
plant breeder and botanist in the USDA,
[SPEAKER_03]: United States Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was their pathologist from 1892 to
1899.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in their plant breeding laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a physiologist in charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got his degree in Nebraska,
undergraduate, and a PhD at Washington
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he came, one of the things that I
found really interesting, I just recently
[SPEAKER_03]: found this, is that in 1907, 1908,
when he came, the department was called
[SPEAKER_03]: the Department of Experimental Plant
Biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in 1908, 1909, it was the
Department of Experimental Plant Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 1909 to 2004, it was the
Department of Plant Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another, here's my macro
evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2004 to 2014, the Department of Plant
Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And genetics, thanks to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is me, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see, because it's further on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did Weber do when he got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently, Bailey's vision for the
department was research, not teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Research.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Weber's, so he wanted Weber to stress
research in biology, biology, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he emphasized genetics and breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Weber decided that, hey, you can't do
this without students.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have graduate students.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he started this graduate education
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he initiated research with students on
weed and oats and barley and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he produced the first over-pollinated
corn grain, which we call 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the first group of the synapsis
group, or the synapsis and faculty,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the spring of 1908.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Dr. Weber right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bailey wanted him to work with farmers
and help the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bailey came as a horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also was very interested in
farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he asked Weber to write a bulletin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first bulletin that came out of our
department was the Plant Breeders for
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers in 1908.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find the copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You won a prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then he established formal courses
in plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found it in the faculty directories
and the registries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, they called it back the course
that Weber first taught.
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, he was an effective
mentor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he trained many notable graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most notable that we remember is H.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love, who was actually the dean of the
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Dr. Love, a young Dr. Love
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that Bailey did is he really
wanted Weber because Bailey did not want
[SPEAKER_03]: to continue to be the dean.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted somebody else to take charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that he could go off and travel and
collect plants and do all his things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dr. Weber said, look,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can take some trips and I'll be
active.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was acting dean for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that happened during
this time is that this guy, his name is
[SPEAKER_03]: Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gilbert was a teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this time, genetics had just come
to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendel's work had just been rediscovered
in 1900.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only was genetics being applied to
plants and animals, but also to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had something at Cornell called the
Eugenics Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a eugenics society at
Cold Harbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I get rid of that?
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Weber was the person who was the
advisor for the Eugenics Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, Gilbert was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gilbert was the advisor for the Eugenics
Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Weber, he even let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't even involved with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But later on, when the successor to Weber
comes along, he decides that, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is not what he wants to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you about that in a second.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Weber was recruited to go to the USDA
in Riverside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around 1912.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody had to be assigned as his
successor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So R.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerson succeeded Weber.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a complicated story in that
Emerson had gone to Harvard to get his SCD
[SPEAKER_03]: with East, Edward Murray East,
in 1913.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did the first work on
quantitative genetics and proved that
[SPEAKER_03]: there was more than one gene involved in
the character.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Weber really wanted Emerson to
succeed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he couldn't make the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason he couldn't make the
recommendation was because Weber was his
[SPEAKER_03]: brother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fortunately, Edward Murray East
knew that he couldn't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he writes to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, listen, you want me to make
the recommendation to the dean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that this is the best geneticist
that consists of students.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best geneticist in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should get him to be the new chair
of the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fortunately, Bailey and other
people said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they brought Emerson here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Emerson.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of his major contributions that we
probably all remember is that Emerson and
[SPEAKER_03]: his students established the School of
Mase Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he began the Mase Genetics Cooperation
newsletter in 1929.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, a lot of people think that it was
1932 because that's what Weber said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was actually in 1929 that the first
Mase Newsletter went out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did Emerson do when he got here in
1914?
[SPEAKER_03]: He decided, and it's a long, complicated
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't go through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he decided that he wanted to get rid
of Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want Mase Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he arranged for Gilbert to get a
position elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this picture doesn't have any pictures
of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two synapsis club pictures from 1921
and 1923 do not have any pictures of
[SPEAKER_03]: Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they do have is this guy,
C.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hutchison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And C.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hutchison is right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Emerson recruited him from Missouri
because he was supposedly a fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought him here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a PhD at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, you're going to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make you a faculty member.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to go to Harvard and get
your PhD with East.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent them up there to work with East.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he never finished his PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he got a master's and came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only did he come back knowing less
about core genetics, but he also brought
[SPEAKER_03]: the Jusophila genetics with him to plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Castle was up there doing Jusophila
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, we can't just do breeding with
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to learn animal
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person who worked with him was Dr.
Frazier, who took his position after C.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hutchison left.
[SPEAKER_03]: He became dean out in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Emerson hired a bunch of really
incredible faculty members.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go through this quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 1921, Emerson went up to the AAAS
meetings in Canada and Toronto and brought
[SPEAKER_03]: back a whole slew of great geneticists to
visit your department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're familiar with these guys,
you might know that this is C.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bridges, a Jusophila geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Sue Wright, worked with guinea
pigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Metz, who worked with Jusophila.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is C.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hutchison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Bateson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bateson was the person who translated
Mendel's work into English so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: could all read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was the first person who really
pushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, Emerson knew these guys were
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, come to Cornell and visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the picture that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the building that they were
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody recognize this building?
[SPEAKER_03]: This used to be called the Forestry
Building.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Vernal Hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you the buildings in the
back and show you the evolution of the
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 1925, the genesis club in the
department had their first 25th
[SPEAKER_03]: anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, 1932, they had their 25th
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell hosted the International
Conference of Genetics here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerson was a major speaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Dr. Morgan, the Jusophila
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years later, he would win the Nobel
Prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what room they're in?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where Rhodes comes in and
thinks that this is when the first
[SPEAKER_03]: newsletter was started in 1932.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Rhodes writes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what he remembered.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once they decided to have this 25th
anniversary of the department,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you a picture of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a whole bunch of people who got
together during this 25th anniversary of
[SPEAKER_03]: synapses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what building this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1932?
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the building that Harry Craig
was just looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how you can climb this building?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Plant Science without all the
ivy all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at our picture in our book
of this 25th anniversary from 1932,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see there's a lot of question marks
on the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were people who came back for the
genetics congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were Cornelians.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all got together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were probably former synapses
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the IDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the people in this picture,
I don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Murph and I went crazy trying to ID them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Emerson was a great supporter of
synapses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went hunting, brought back denizens
so they could all get together and have
[SPEAKER_03]: meals together.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, the synapses club room ended
on November what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 04, Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you some pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing in 1932 that we had was
the Living Maze map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 1932, Emerson gave this fabulous
talk on the update of core genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was these wonderful sighted
geneticists that he trained or that worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with him at Cornell who were able to find
the linkage maps and put the genes on the
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbara McClintock was head of this whole
group working with beetle and working with
[SPEAKER_03]: roads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did this Living Maze map down
next to the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I hate this picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why I hate this picture?
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you about this last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you go online and you look at
this picture, it says, this is Barbara
[SPEAKER_03]: McClintock as a student with Emerson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1929, Dr. McClintock.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a PhD for two years already.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only students in this picture are
Beetle, the dog, and Marcus Rhodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only students.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dr. McClintock, Professor
McClintock.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go online, you will see that
she's a student.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what building is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the shed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 1929 to 1940, the Great Depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: People couldn't find jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerson was trying really hard to get jobs
for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was reduced support for graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of this is in the archives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see all these letters back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we going to support the students?
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, there was increased activity in
veg crops breeding, quantitative
[SPEAKER_03]: inheritance in corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow they got the support going.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy, R.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lewis, who I'm not going to talk a lot
about, but if you want to know more about
[SPEAKER_03]: his book, he moved to Ohio State
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do want to emphasize is this
Rockefeller Foundation grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerson wrote to the Rockefeller
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I really want to get this Mays
newsletter going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to get the seed stock
cooperatives going, which is still going
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockefeller Foundation said, well,
they had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody else did, but they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Barbara McClintock had gone to Europe
in 1933.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't stay very long because the war was
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she came back and didn't know what she
was going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on a Guggenheim, and the
Guggenheim was running out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Emerson wrote this grant in aid for
her and got her a two-year grant in aid to
[SPEAKER_03]: work as his assistant in the plant
breeding department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was Emerson's student.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be able to do whatever they have
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ring chromosome work was started
during that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we had a lot of international
activities going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Dr. Murphy and I could just talk
10 years ago, we started with the Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Nanking, China, 1924, 1930.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love, Myers, Wiggins, we said that was the
history of international programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's true is that this guy, Gero D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brill, Cornell undergraduate, 1888,
he went to China, and he became the head
[SPEAKER_03]: of a new school of agriculture in China in
1888.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was before we started.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, Cornell Nanking, China,
1914 to 1931, John Henry Reisner,
[SPEAKER_03]: Reisner was a minor in plant breeding with
Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember I told you we got rid of him in
1914.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he came in 1912, and he might have
been plant breeding with Gilbert,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he made him field crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next person to give a talk in this
seminar series is going to be Mr. Singh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Song, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to talk to you about John
Henry Reisner and how he got his training
[SPEAKER_03]: at Cornell to be able to go to Cornell and
work as the dean of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he was the dean of agriculture in
Nanking, China, then he invited back his
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful professors from Cornell to go
there and work and help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the history of the connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't go back only to Cornell
Nanking, but it goes back to 1888,
[SPEAKER_03]: international.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so then Love also worked as an advisor
in China and went to Puerto Rico as an
[SPEAKER_03]: advisor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that stuff's in his history book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so Dr. Emerson retired in 1942,
and they tried to figure out who to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Murphy did not want to talk about
this succession.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, it's very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me tell you, I'm going to tell
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: As briefly as I could make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerson wanted Rhodes to come back and
head the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhodes wanted Mangelsdorf to come with him
from Harvard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's tons of letters in the
archives, back and forth, Rhodes saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: should I go back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mangelsdorf saying, you should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, we'll work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Barbara Klintak puts those two
sentences, you don't want to go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a letter about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rhodes, what should I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a hellion when I was in the same
freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hate me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he says, no, I'm not going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Mangelsdorf says, well,
if you're not going back now, I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not back, but I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the soul story is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what happens is the dean throws up
his hands and says, what the hell am I
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing you know, Dr. Love is
acting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dean says, you know, this was just
Dr. Myers, I think it was, was the dean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, look, you know, you've been
in this department since it was started.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know everything about the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make you acting head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he makes an acting head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, he does so well that he
becomes the chair of the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Frazier unfortunately dies during
this time period.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very sick with cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Dr. Love brings in new faculty,
Dr. Munger, Dr. Cushing, Dr. Atwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from 1942 to 1946, what was happening
in the war?
[SPEAKER_04]: The war.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the men?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the assistants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we're going to have some room for
women now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we've got to get some women in
here, because there's no men to help us in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get the women to help,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, actually, there were women,
there were women before who did research.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't get PhDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why didn't they get PhDs?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about this with the
graduates this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because the faculty felt if they got
a student in here, they had to get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they knew that the farmers were not
going to listen to the woman in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said, you know, you can do minor,
you can minor in plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: but why don't you major in botany?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how many women major in botany
and didn't major in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by the time the war came, they had a
macroevolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first woman graduate student was
Leona Schell, 1946.
[SPEAKER_03]: The year was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got her PhD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had a Chinese student,
Fengti Feng, Rosalyn Morris, who became a
[SPEAKER_03]: famous plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's been here a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Florence Thomas, 1948.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the new students who came.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had some people retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some pictures there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the IDs are all in the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to show you ID them all,
but you can get them from the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so Love had a vision from 1944 to
1949.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted the expansion of the plant
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to do more on the pure seed
program, increase research support if he
[SPEAKER_03]: could get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he hired additional six faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the Synapsis Club,
1949.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how many people are there,
but are there any women?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the women?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a few women in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so how about students?
[SPEAKER_03]: From 1946 to 1949, some more money started
coming in after the war.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had assistantships from the state
and federal government and GLF farm
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got GI support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the men who came back could go
to school on the GI bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were 23 veterans who came to the
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were national governments
who gave money and sent foreign men and
[SPEAKER_03]: the Rockefeller Foundation support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are the new plant breeding
faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Jensen was hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Johnson was hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the real tall one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Serb came in as a geneticist,
not a plant breeder, but as a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Serb, Adrian Serb, was a student of
Beadle's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beadle wanted him recommended that he come
back to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Murphy, here on the left, Dr. Smith.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Federer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dr. Federer was the biometry person,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Love also did a lot of biometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the six new faculty members.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another one of these,
what I would call a macro evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: team, a bunch of brand new young faculty
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Murphy's the call of the young folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a lot of trouble, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture that Dr. Murphy called
Love's post-World War II transfer
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Love was about to retire here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way Dr. Murphy told me this story,
Dr. Love decided to call Dr. Bailey and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, look, you started this department.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to come and meet all these
young people who are doing fabulous work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to take you out in the field
and show you all their research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bailey said, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know who took the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think this is a fabulous
picture of all these young people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Bailey in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Dr. Love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Dr. Murphy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Dr. Murphy tells the story that
when they wanted to get in the cars to go
[SPEAKER_03]: out into the field, he asked everybody,
what are you working on?
[SPEAKER_03]: And people told him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Murphy said, well, I'm working on
Tim's progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm going to ride with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my first projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Tim's progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ride with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Murphy loved to tell that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't tell it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So up until 1949, then Love retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a summary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it a summary slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Love became head in 44 following World
War II.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said the department in a new direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Atwood and Murphy were hired by Love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they hired young faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dr. Murphy used to say,
all planned for any faculty members or
[SPEAKER_03]: leaders in their field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to show you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the Atwood and Murphy years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Dr. Murphy was very, very mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked a lot, but he was very,
very mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't really want to say
everything that he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all he said is, let me put Atwood
and Murphy together and tell you about
[SPEAKER_03]: what we did together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that they followed Love's
vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hired new faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Everett came along to study corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Lowe, Dr. Steele, Dr. York.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cornell Los Banos project in the
Philippines got underway in 1952 because
[SPEAKER_03]: we were trying to help the Philippines
recover after the war.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to go through that
because Dr. Turk wrote this Los Banos
[SPEAKER_03]: story that you can find online and read it
in 1974.
[SPEAKER_03]: Atwood was appointed the dean of the
graduate school in 1953 and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: provost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another, again, major change happened
here, a macroevolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Murphy was appointed the head of
the department in 1953-1954.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, many of you remember Dr. Murphy as
the head of the department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did great things, which is all,
most of it, written down in our history.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 50th anniversary of synapsis was 1957.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he decided during this time that they
should have another 25th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they brought back speakers and the
symposium presentation by former students
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the former students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they talked about is in our
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened during this time period,
some major changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the first three things listed
there, remodeling the facilities and the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding garden shed and cordwell
field house, were done by Atwood,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to what Dr. Murphy told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant science building space was
renovated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't in this building yet,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't in this building until 1968.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Murphy built temporary plastic
greenhouses, lab houses, and cold frames
[SPEAKER_03]: because we were running out of space to do
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what Murphy's contribution was,
a major thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he felt that the cooperation was a
very, very important contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plant breeding research, here's a
picture of Murphy pollinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get it.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures of Murphy pollinating his
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got, during this time from 1954,
to 1964, we have improved varieties of
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat, hybrid corn, oats, barley,
alfalfa, grasses, tomatoes, beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were going crazy putting out
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want a list of all the things,
that's why I was able to do this,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: He compiled all the new varieties that we
put together and put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The genetics research, biochemical
genetics was becoming prominent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiation and chemical mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quantitative inheritance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corn seed stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mays newsletter was transferred to
Illinois because people here weren't going
[SPEAKER_03]: to take care of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost the grant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who was at Illinois?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he took care of it with who,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ellen Debsie.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the Mays newsletter at Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pure seed program cooperation efforts
with various Cornell departments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of cooperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Emerson believed in cooperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, everybody, we follow that
tradition here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to have cooperation amongst
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The student funding from 46 to 64,
from what Murphy said, was where he found
[SPEAKER_03]: this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Federal State Ag Experiment Station
had funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Federal grants, USDA, GLF farm crops,
192 student majors during this time,
[SPEAKER_03]: 329 minor students, botany, plant path.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a whole bunch of people,
minoring in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: More new faculty, plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are people that Dr. Murphy hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant breeding, the first woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody thinks that Lisa was the first
woman in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the second.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who is the first woman in plant
breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Margaret Emmerling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did she come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: The University of Missouri.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who did she do her PhD with?
[SPEAKER_03]: L.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stadler.
[SPEAKER_03]: L.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stadler was the person who hired Barbara
McClintock and gave her her first
[SPEAKER_03]: assistant professorship at Missouri.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Stadler, so Margaret Emmerling,
and Dr. Murphy told me that it wasn't easy
[SPEAKER_03]: to hire a woman in this department.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did care.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to do it.
He did.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was 1958.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other person who was new and a
Drosophila geneticist was hired in this
[SPEAKER_03]: department.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody know who that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Wallace, standing next to Dr.
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Wallace came in 1958 from Cold
Spring Harbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was working at Cold Spring Harbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Murphy said, you know, we're going to
get a Drosophila geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a plant breeding department.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a genetics department.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get the best person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Wallace came.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Wallace came.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other person that was new was Harry
Stinson.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came in 62, 62, 63, in genetics as a
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they hired him down from the
agricultural research station in
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a lot of new faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's identified in the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go through the IDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested, you can look.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of you recognize these people,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can giggle at the young faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of geneticists were hired,
but the name plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the time we finished 1964,
when Dr. Murphy was done with that part,
[SPEAKER_03]: he said, OK, I can't write about the
history of the new group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, here's what we're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the living faculty people who
were department chairs during this time
[SPEAKER_03]: period up to 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Dr. Playstead, right,
and William Pardee, Ronnie Kaufman,
[SPEAKER_03]: Elizabeth Earle, Ronnie Kaufman again,
and Mark Searls.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the new chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the bell that they,
you know, like in rotary, you do the
[SPEAKER_03]: gavel, pass the gavel.
[SPEAKER_03]: In plant breeding, we passed the bell.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark, at the time, was the new chair
of plant breeding, 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had our centennial.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, look, we'll just ask the
chairs, could you just please write one
[SPEAKER_03]: page?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one page.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said to Dr. Murphy, as soon as they
start writing, they're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the book, you'll see
each group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to quickly, very quickly,
go through what these people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So under Dr. Playstead, we had the Cornel
Los Vangels Project, 63 to 72.
[SPEAKER_03]: The geneticists, who were the geneticists?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wallace, Bruce Wallace, Adrian Serb,
and Harry Stinson.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all geneticists in plant
breeding at this point in 1964,
[SPEAKER_03]: 1965, there was a new division of
biological sciences that was established
[SPEAKER_03]: in the College of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this new division had sections.
[SPEAKER_03]: The section that the geneticists went to
was called the section of genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: development, and physiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I got my degree.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the geneticists left, or the pure
geneticists, not the plant breeding they
[SPEAKER_03]: applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went over to the division of
biological sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I put it in italics.
[SPEAKER_03]: McClintock came as an ADY professor at
large in 1965 in this new section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I got to meet her,
because fortunately, her appointment was
[SPEAKER_03]: rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was a six-year appointment,
and then they renewed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 1971, when I came to graduate
school, I got to meet her.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant breeding moved to Bradfield Hall in
1968.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when we got here.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biometry became a semi-autonomous unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You asked me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plant breeding majors took a leading
role in SNAPS during this time,
[SPEAKER_03]: 64 to 79.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under Dr. Playstead, we got 10 new
faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second woman was appointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Earle was appointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three retirements, faculty awards to Love,
Munger, Jensen, and Wallace, and two named
[SPEAKER_03]: chairs, two L.H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bailey chairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: William Pardee, 79 to 87.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four new faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another woman was hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 75th synapses reunion took place here
on campus in 1982.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you who hold these here may have
remembered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all the people at the 75th
union.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Bernal Hall used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forestry building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Barbara McClintock is standing right
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a program called the Golden Age
of Corn Genetics that all of these great
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeders and geneticists came back
to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Marcus Rhodes, Charlie Burnham,
Barbara McClintock, Harry Crichton,
[SPEAKER_03]: George Sprague, and Harold Perry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all gave talks, and we recorded it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to listen to them,
you go to the archives and check out the
[SPEAKER_03]: tape, and you can hear their
presentations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ronnie Kaufman became chair in 87 to 93.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hired another woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two new faculty, one retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an A.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: White visiting professor, Swaminathan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mark and Ronnie had the first
email set up in the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: department.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the college didn't want to do it,
so they did it themselves, as I recall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Ronnie set up an off-campus
irrigation for experimental fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were some of his major
accomplishments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Earl, two new faculty, another woman
she hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during this time, three women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was increased emphasis on genomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was able to figure out how to get
funding for graduate students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very inventive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go through all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had two faculty awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Tanksley got the von Humboldt Award,
and Dr. Munger got the C Prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this department had major
contributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ronnie came back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called it the Ronnie reprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called it the Ronnie reprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: One new faculty member was hired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the faculty are all listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to tell you all the
names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Dr. Murphy with Dr. Borlaug.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was an A.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: White visiting professor here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a picture from that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: During this time, we had the Department of
Genetics and Plant Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding
was the new name that's under Ronnie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're now no longer Department of Plant
Breeding, but we're the Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics and Plant Breeding since 2004.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics got added back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Experimental biology, experimental plant
breeding, and plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you added it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was plant breeding and biology for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably should have put that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for reminding me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The College of Agriculture had its
centennial in 2004.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Dr. Murphy and I holding a palm
leaf over our heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wearing centennial buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Ronnie put up a modern seed
storage unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduate students in Cornell Plant
Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up until 2007, 801 degrees had been
awarded to students in Plant Breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: 307 masters, 494 doctorates, and students
from 70 different nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we published our book right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Dr. Murphy on the tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to get some more pictures of
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this was something that I had to try
to do because of the digital dark age.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're losing our history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have stuff being printed and
put in files anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to try to find, where is all
this stuff that happened since 2007?
[SPEAKER_03]: And during the time that Mark was chair
from 2007 to 2014, it was the last year of
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had our centennial celebration.
[SPEAKER_03]: All new office staff, except for Judy
Sanger over there, had been here longer
[SPEAKER_03]: than Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy Sanger was here longer than Mark,
but we had all new office staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that meant?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the computers got upgraded and all the
history got lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were ranked the number one plant
breeding doctoral program in the nation by
[SPEAKER_03]: the National Research Center during Mark's
tenure here as chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was transition of the field staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We expanded the collaborations with
Cornell's International Program and Mark's
[SPEAKER_03]: at Bank of Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was acquisition of renovation of
Redfield 204, which we just had lunch in
[SPEAKER_03]: that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The largest number of graduate students
since 1978 when Mark stepped down as
[SPEAKER_03]: chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just all the faculty honors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I don't have time really to read
this to you, but there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty honors.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I want to point out is
Susan, Susan Mccoochie came far as a
[SPEAKER_03]: Flintop professor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Doyle got a merit award from the
Botanical Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, there was a World
Agriculture Prize to Kauffman,
[SPEAKER_03]: Chancellor's Award to Mccooch,
Women in Agronomy, Crops and Soils
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental Science Mentoring Award to
Ronnie.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these great things happened during
this time period.
[SPEAKER_03]: The synapsis club, I think I got the wrong
date on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this 2015 or 2014?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here's Mark in the field.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: After 107 years, the department became a
section in the new School of Integrative
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jeff became the section chair,
twisting and turning his hands,
[SPEAKER_03]: arms to do it, from what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked him for some pictures of himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me some very formal pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, no, I don't want formal
pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he gave me these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Plant Breeding and Genetics 2014
Faculty Awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to point these out.
[SPEAKER_03]: National Academy of Sciences Prize in Food
and Agriculture to Buckler, Japan Prize to
[SPEAKER_03]: Tanksley, Andrew James Tisch Distinguished
Professor Ronnie, Outstanding Research
[SPEAKER_03]: Award to Sorrels, and the Synapsis Cafe,
which I thought I was going to go to for
[SPEAKER_03]: lunch, is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was our talk, but not the way Dr.
Murphy gave it, the way I gave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to hear Dr. Murphy give
this talk, you can go to this website on
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can hear it without the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: With me in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was his first, it was his first,
it was his first PCT.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's my epilogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Dark Age, the Future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, it wasn't last year,
it was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vint Cerf, a Google Vice President and
father of the internet, predicted that all
[SPEAKER_03]: images and documents now saved on
computers will eventually be lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: He predicts the 21st century will be a
digital dark age.
[SPEAKER_03]: Current computer documents risk being lost
in the wake of accelerated digital
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution, unless a solution is digitally
bound to digital evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I'm begging you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am begging you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, any time something great happens,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will print it out.
Shalom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was taped, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was taped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taped.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was taped.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was taped.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could, if she wants to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Ed.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear what he said?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he wanted to wanted to,
he was hoping that the new president of
[SPEAKER_03]: the college could have been here for this
talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: University.
[SPEAKER_03]: University, sorry.
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, she's holding the sun up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Hachem.
Questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: You had the picture from around the 1932
International Congress on Genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a bunch of people you couldn't
identify.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do have the ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a print of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1932 Synapses Club.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are all those people in the big picture?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know the big picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do have the big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all identified in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to see if.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use photo recognition to find
her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you do it for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have IDs of all the people in the plant
reading group.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, because I have original prints from
the 1932 Congress that came out of NC
[SPEAKER_07]: State and a closet that was going to be
tossed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea where they were from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of the night?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at least both of us need to take
Leigha on her excellence and go back to
the American theater violin and print
these things out.
You know, I first became aware of this
digital arcade back around 2000.
We had a meeting in Washington,
D.C.
and the National Archivist invited several
people because the archivist didn't know
what the hell to do with it.
They just come and go and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he called a meeting and nobody else he
wants to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, there was a guy that from
Germany, the National Archivist,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said more is known about 17 century
England than is known about the German
Democratic Republic because they had a
Soviet computer system and they put their
land records and everything to do with
their society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put it on that system and it just
completely went away with the collapse of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Berlin Wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of thing we're facing
when it comes to preserving this
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we should all try to find
things that are significant and bundle
[SPEAKER_01]: them to Leigha.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an archivist here who has a
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eileen, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say also contact us if you
retire.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about, like, I was just cleaning out
my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the original computer and it still
works, but I haven't gotten it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's nice to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a comment that I have put
together a very small file for Henry
[SPEAKER_00]: Munger's archive and that's all we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have asked my manager and my friend,
I've asked all the people to please help
[SPEAKER_00]: me get his files out of the trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't filing nothing for the
trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved to the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The archive says nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not given them my file yet,
but we would like to put some things
[SPEAKER_00]: together for Henry Munger for the what's
kind of thing that's in my record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions for Leigha?
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, let's thank Leigha.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
