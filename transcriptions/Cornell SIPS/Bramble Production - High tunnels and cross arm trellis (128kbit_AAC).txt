[SPEAKER_03]: And our first speaker is Dr. Marvin Pritz.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the Department of Horticulture Chair
at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has been the small fruit specialist
for many years and has done a lot of work
[SPEAKER_03]: with high tunnel growing with raspberries
and blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Pritz, I'm going to move it right
to you.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really nice to see so many people
from so many different places attend the
[SPEAKER_00]: webinar today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to compliment Laura on
scheduling a meeting about keeping plants
[SPEAKER_00]: warm and dry on probably the coldest day
of the year and maybe even a decade for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about producing raspberries
and blackberries out of season using high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels and a little bit of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this will focus on high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of reasons why we can
use high tunnels and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we can improve overwintering
of our plants, which is probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be real important this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our season is extended, so the fruits are
worth more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit quality is higher and yields are
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is just a photo of some thornless
blackberries and some red raspberries
[SPEAKER_00]: after winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this often happens in more northern
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get killed by cold winter
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new primate canes grow just fine,
but the old canes die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price off season, if you can somehow
bring those crops on earlier or produce
[SPEAKER_00]: them later, can be quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a photograph I took from a grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see $4.99 for a half pint of
raspberries and $6.99 for a half pint of
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good money.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels are being used all around the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain and Portugal uses them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotland uses them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even California, most of the
raspberries now are growing to crop under
[SPEAKER_00]: these tunnels, not so much for warmth,
but just to keep the moisture off the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality is so much better when the
raspberries don't get wet, even from dew,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it doesn't rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are taken off everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: California will even go to the extent of
putting up wind barricades because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that too much wind damages raspberry
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this farm here, not only did they
trellis the raspberries, but they put up
[SPEAKER_00]: this netting here to reduce the wind on
the plant so that they produce more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvin, can I interrupt just for a second?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are having a number of people say that
they don't see any picture, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: different problem than we've had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just am wondering, is anybody able to
see the video?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have some people that see it and
some people that don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps it is taking a while to load,
so thank you very much for all of your
[SPEAKER_03]: comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hopeful that those of you that are
not seeing it, that maybe it will load in
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is somebody that just said that...
So David Culp, you have said that the
[SPEAKER_03]: Adobe Presenter, maybe it is loading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just your connection may not be fast
enough, and so I'm hopeful that you were
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to add a load in when you got
onto the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think it's just taking a while
for this presentation to load.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps it's frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big presentation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's just give it a moment and
hopefully everybody is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Marvin, I'll let you continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if you can see the photograph
here, you can see what can happen to a
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel if you have too much wind,
and the wind can be damaging to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels if you don't manage them
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point I want to make is that the
tunnels are good for temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: management, moisture management,
and wind management, and our plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: really benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, here it says northeast,
but all throughout the northern tier of
[SPEAKER_00]: states, we have three reasons why we could
use tunnels, and lots of other places
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world only have one reason,
and they use tunnels for that one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the possible reasons to use a
tunnel in our climate, and so we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with different ways of using
tunnels to grow raspberries off season
[SPEAKER_00]: with higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plant I want to talk about are
fall fruiting raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants that produce fruit in the
first year of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow up, they flower in the late
summer, they produce fruit in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: fall, and we can start picking that fruit,
at least for us, late August, early
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from the figure here,
we start to pick in late August,
[SPEAKER_00]: we start picking up in September,
and just about the time we get into full
[SPEAKER_00]: production, we get our first frost at the
end of September, early October,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a shame because there's a lot more
fruit on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the advantages of a high tunnel
is that we can continue to pick that fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: even after the frost comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are ways of accelerating the
harvest without using a high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and row covers are one way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the plants first come out of the
ground, you can cover them with a row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, like you see here, and that will
accelerate the growth, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produce fruit earlier and yield
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we've done that, with
raspberries, we can see that without a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, this is our yield distribution and
our season, these are days after August
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put on a cover for April,
we bring that crop on earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we put that cover on in March,
we can bring it on even earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's indeed one way you can
accelerate the harvest and bring that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: on before that frost comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to do that one row at a time,
and this is what we used to do until high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels came along where we could cover at
least four rows at a time, and it was much
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient at doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus it was easier to pick the fruit
without having to deal with those
[SPEAKER_00]: individual row covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first strategy with the high tunnel
was to look at the thickness of the row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, by the way, was 0.6 ounces per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a heavy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually looked at heavy and lighter
covers, and it didn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seemed like a row cover worked,
and plastic over top of the plants out low
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ground did not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually probably made the plants too
hot, and raspberries don't like heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a row cover worked better in that
situation than a plastic cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to a high tunnel,
the tunnels are much higher, and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation, and the temperatures don't
climb to nearly the level they do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel as they would in a sheet of
plastic over a low grown plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first strategy is to look at these
cultivars of raspberry and actually maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even try to delay harvest, which we would
never do in the field, but to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit later in the season from when it's
normally available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one of our tunnels, and it shows
a crop of heritage raspberry being
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants inside there look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of fruit, but the date is
October 20th, and for those of you who are
[SPEAKER_00]: from upstate New York, October 20th,
the leaves are off the trees by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had several hard frosts,
and plants outside are done fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are starting to drop,
but inside the tunnel you can see we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caroline is a good variety for the high
tunnel in mid-October.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the fruit looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a bunch of different
varieties to see which ones would do well
[SPEAKER_00]: for us, and we find that Heritage does
just great in a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caroline does great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autumn Britain was when we tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on early really well,
but then it drops off pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josephine is another variety that actually
comes on strong later and had really good
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and good size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one that we can grow in a high
tunnel without any manipulation and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice late crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just some yield data over a couple
of years of Autumn Britain and Caroline
[SPEAKER_00]: Heritage and Josephine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at yields, Caroline and Heritage,
as I mentioned before, do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autumn Britain, not quite so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was impressive was Josephine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much because of yield, but the
berry size is pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the fruit is about twice the
size of Heritage or Caroline, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less our standard, and the flavor
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like a really strong,
great raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and these plants are all planted in
the ground, just like you would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the field, and I'll show you what
we do here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they're just planted in the
ground, and the tunnels are put up over
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Heritage, and compare that to
Josephine, and you can look at the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: on here, and some of the berries are
coming off at over seven grams apiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty excited about Josephine as
a variety for late season.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we wanted to do is have
Heritage come in later, too, because in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, we don't want it later,
but in a tunnel, why not have it later if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got it protected for a while?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at several different ways of
growing the plants and manipulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered the plants with straw in the
late winter, early spring, to see if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could delay their emergence from the
ground, to see if that would delay their
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the canes came up out of the ground,
we mowed them off and forced them to start
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the canes are about two and a half
feet tall, we pinched the tips to force
[SPEAKER_00]: them to grow branches, and that would slow
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same thing a little bit later,
and then we had our controls that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do anything to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show you the tunnel here
before it was covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are grown in the ground about
seven foot spacing between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mulched them with straw the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also incorporated compost into the area
before we planted, and we just screwed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following year, for our mulching
treatment, we removed the snow towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of February on the plots, and we
replaced that snow with straw to insulate
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and hold in the cold and try to
hold the plants back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, when we looked later on in the
season, when the plants started to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that the ones that were mulched
were shorter and further behind the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that were not mulched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, this is intentional because
we want to deliberately delay the fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: until later if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowing made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that we mowed off and forced to
start over again were further behind than
[SPEAKER_00]: those that were not mowed, the controls,
and that difference was maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also pinched plants, and we pinched the
growing tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they were about two and a half to
three feet tall, forced them to grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That slowed them down a little bit,
and you can see that difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had all those treatments,
and then towards the fall of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: late summer, early fall, we covered the
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants flowered, and there we are
covering the tunnel on September 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing is you don't have to have
these tunnels covered all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, we only wanted to
produce the crop late, so if we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: covered them early, it would have brought
the crop on earlier, and we really didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see how we could do by having
a late crop, so we didn't want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate their growth too much,
so we waited until September to cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we are pulling the row cover
over the tunnel, pulling it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we are harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question came up, how's Himbo top?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at Himbo top at Geneva in our
variety trial, and it does pretty well in
[SPEAKER_00]: a tunnel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit funky in terms of
picking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit hard to see the fruit
sometimes, but in terms of flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: size, it's a pretty good one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the dilemmas we have in these
tunnels is they're only so big,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't really look at a lot of
different things at one time, but I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you Brett to contact Courtney
Weber at caw34 at Cornell.edu,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's got a lot of data on Himbo top
along with a lot of other varieties for
[SPEAKER_00]: the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just looked at the ones that are a
little bit more common that we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: people could get a hold of and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing we were concerned about in
the high tunnel is pollination late in the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In September, you're going to get bees,
and we were a little bit concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but we found that the bees love the
high tunnel, and they come in and droves
[SPEAKER_00]: and just hang out in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are bumblebees all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that cool, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps them out of the frost from
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no trouble with pollination of our
flowers in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are mid-October, lots and lots of
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, outside we've had frosts already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't see this outside,
but inside we have lots of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now towards the end of October,
early November, we sometimes get nights
[SPEAKER_00]: when it gets down in the mid to low 20s,
but only just for maybe one night,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it warms up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got another week or so of really
decent weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do on those really cold nights is
we know that that single layer of plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: will not protect the plants when it gets
that cold, but if we take a row cover and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw over the plants for just that night
and then take it off the next day,
[SPEAKER_00]: often that's enough to get the plants to
that one or two cold nights, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is why are those bird scare
devices inside that tunnel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember we didn't cover that tunnel
until September 13th, so during the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: the birds would come in there and roost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so much a problem eating the
fruit as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't like the birds up there
pooping on our heads when we were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to manipulate canes and prune and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are November 5th in Ithaca picking
pretty decent fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got fruit all the way up until November
15th, and we've done this for multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: years now, and November 15th is kind of
about the end of the line on the
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll still be there, but they don't
ripen very quickly, so we cut it off then.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of how these treatments worked,
this blue line here is a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not doing any manipulation,
and you can see that right here is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: would get our first frost, so typically
we'd be done in the field right about this
[SPEAKER_00]: point here, but because we have the tunnel
the plants keep on producing fruit all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up until 14 weeks after August 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty long harvest season,
14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing these pinching treatments,
a little bit of late pinching or early
[SPEAKER_00]: pinching, we were able to delay the peak
of production until end of October,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that was actually kind of a good
way of spreading out the harvest peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having some that you don't pinch and
having some that you pinch and it shifts
[SPEAKER_00]: to production peak about four weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other treatments that I explained to
you, the mulching treatment and the mowing
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, they didn't do as well,
so we're not exploring those any further
[SPEAKER_00]: or recommending those any further,
but the pinching looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinching either when a panel is about two
and a half to three and a half feet tall
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be about the right time to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another year's data, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the control plots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frost comes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally be out of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when we're getting started,
but we can keep on going with the controls
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the pinching, this early pinching
when the plants are about two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: to three feet tall, shifted to production
peak later, and it really didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't suffer that much in terms of
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the yield from the control and with
the pinching treatments, and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: some reduction, but not a lot with the
early pinching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berry size wasn't affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mulching and the mowing treatments I
said didn't do very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second strategy was take these
primate canes and instead of getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: to fruit late, maybe we could cover the
tunnels early and bring them on earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but remember I showed
you the row covers over the plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field when they were just starting to
emerge from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we thought, well, could we do the
same thing inside a high tunnel?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do the plants when they start
up have a big high tunnel over them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also have a row cover or even a
sheet of plastic over them when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: short and small, just coming up of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could really maybe accelerate the
harvest season quite a bit by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the end of the year when
they're starting to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are plants in the field that are
growing outside the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is heritage in the same variety in
the high tunnel with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goodness, these plants grow like
crazy in the high tunnel, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the heritage plants grew so
much that it was a real problem harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just a little bit too tall for
my short helper here, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sometimes had to stand on a little
stool to get the fruit off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did that mean that these plants here
had much higher yield than these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were growing in a field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we looked at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size of the plant, the fruit
didn't really make much difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yields actually didn't really make
much difference either.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if we covered them earlier or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference was the ones that we
covered early came on sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones inside the tunnel ripened
earlier and maybe went a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than those in the field where the harvest
was delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, the yields didn't
really change that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planting the plastic in September for
extended fall harvest, the way I explained
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, gave us 2,860 half pines per
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applying plastic under the tunnel in early
spring for accelerated harvest brought the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop on earlier, but the yield was just
almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, since you've grown those
really long canes, what if you saved those
[SPEAKER_00]: canes through the winter and then fruited
them the following spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be worthwhile doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much yield do you get from doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a study where we double cropped
versus single cropped these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our fall crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,600 grams per meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we held them over and
harvested again those now flora canes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer, we got about 50% more yield by
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you have to overwinter the canes,
but we did get some additional yield
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fall crop, and if you hold it over and
harvest those flora canes the following
[SPEAKER_00]: summer, you get about 50% more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not quite that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know our summer helpers didn't
particularly like picking those flora
[SPEAKER_00]: canes in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crop is a little bit shorter and
lower, a little bit harder to pick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you definitely got additional fruit
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big difference between the field and
the tunnel in this case was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields were somewhat less in the field
than the indoor tunnel, and the marketable
[SPEAKER_00]: yield was better inside the tunnel than
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third strategy was trying to overwinter
tender blackberries and raspberries in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a year like this, we're probably
going to get some blackberry winter kill
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, and maybe some raspberry winter
kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can a high tunnel protect your plants
from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this tunnel was only just a single
sheet of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tunnels we're using for
overwintering are these peaked tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like the haygrove type,
which is rounded at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plastic really has to come off in the
fall before the snow hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tunnels here are specially
constructed with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforced steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipes are about four feet apart
instead of five, and so it will hold a
[SPEAKER_00]: snow load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will shed off of these points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is still only a single sheet of
plastic, and these tunnels don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a plant can survive in there,
the temperature is still getting pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: darn cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is that not only do the
plants survive in those tunnels,
[SPEAKER_00]: even with a single sheet of plastic,
but they really thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some thornless blackberries in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only June, and the canes are already
really, really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't do anything with these
canes by the time the end of summer comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be 15, 20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how well they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're already looking at this
down the alleyway between the rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can just see these thornless
blackberries just really make a jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of the challenges is managing
the vegetation on these blackberries
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the tunnel and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see just a comparison between
outside thornless blackberries and inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow really, really well in that
tunnel environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they overwinter well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This appeared in our college newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a little feature article on high
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see in the background the
amount of blackberries that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: in these high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compared to outside, there's not a lot
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we hardly ever harvest much of a
crop outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inside the tunnel, they do real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a high tunnel at Willsboro this
year, which is up along Lake Champlain,
[SPEAKER_00]: just south of the Canadian border,
right along the Vermont border.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew some raspberries both inside and
outside the tunnel there, harvested them
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see the difference
between outside yields and inside yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more than twice as much inside
as outside, especially for jewel black
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry encore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high tunnel just made a huge
difference in that very cold climate up
[SPEAKER_00]: along Lake Champlain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they cut a little bit more mild,
black raspberries, we don't get a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in yields when we look at the
difference between outside and inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 28%, 30% greater yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size is usually bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marketable yields bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest season's longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the blackberries, raspberries are what
really respond to the high tunnel between
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some data on three varieties,
Doyle, Wichita, and Triple Crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any variable we looked at,
whether it be season length or size of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit or yield per plant or percent
marketable fruit, inside the tunnel was
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every variable, every case, every variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the yield differences were
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, fruit needs plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might get a little bit of
fruit, but boy, when you put them inside a
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel, they just yield like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields are just so much greater inside
than outside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just some yield distribution
curves of Doyle that's inside the tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: and outside the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be a statistician to
figure out that there's significant yield
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are different years,
different varieties, and we get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing every time we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same data, inside, outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields are just remarkably different
inside than outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've made a case of
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thornless blackberry can do really well
inside a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one problem we've had with those,
however, are rodent damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, when we went out in March and
April to look at our plants after a long
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, almost all the, in fact,
all the canes were girdled just like this
[SPEAKER_00]: from about a foot up, maybe a foot and a
half up from the ground from rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got into the tunnel over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nice blackberry canes don't have
thorns on them and they fed themselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bark all winter long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have any yield from our
blackberries this year because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to watch out for this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high tunnels have chicken wire around
them to keep the rabbits out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our fourth strategy is to grow
primocane fruiting blackberries under
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just developed in Arkansas about
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow like the heritage red
raspberry, except they're blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blackberry canes grow up and they
flower in the late summer and they fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall and give you an opportunity to
have fruit in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we grow these plants outside in
Ithaca, we tend not to get a crop because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a little bit, the blackberries are
just starting to ripen, but then the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: weather comes and we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could grow these under a high
tunnel, the plants can keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blackberries were developed in
Arkansas, so we have to convince the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberries that they're still growing in
Arkansas, even though it's upstate New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by putting them in a tunnel,
we can convince them to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are what the blackberries look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall, they look like regular
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our blackberry plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some experiments on them,
just like we did with the raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some pinching of primocanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some bending of primocanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had control plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we covered the tunnel late in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the crop looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the yield potential here is
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berry size is really large,
really big fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the treatments we examined to
control the two different pinching times
[SPEAKER_00]: and bending the canes when they reached
the first wire to see if that somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: would promote more fruiting and earlier
fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our pinching treatment,
same as with the red raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some bending treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have the yield data all done
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pinching treatments work the same
way they do with the red raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually, in this case, seem to
increase the yield a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bring the crop on a little bit
later, give you a longer extended season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bending treatments didn't work very
well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't go back and do that or
recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pinching seems to be a good thing for
these primocane fruiting blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the one thing that the blackberries
did this year that the raspberries did not
[SPEAKER_00]: do is that when the weather turned cold in
October, we had an exceptionally cold and
[SPEAKER_00]: wet October this year, the laterals with
the fruit, well, they turned brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of wilted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think this is stress injury from the
cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the laterals that did not have
fruits, like the vegetative laterals,
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibited this symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only laterals with fruit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think what's going on here because
October was so dark and cool that there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't enough carbohydrate in these
plants, particularly with fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruit drew the carbohydrate out of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves just didn't have enough
carbohydrate, didn't have enough ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to make antifreeze or whatever they
produced to give them resistance to cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just sort of collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our yields weren't as high as we had
hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left a lot of reddish fruit here in the
plants that theoretically could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested in a more normal year that had a
little bit more light and heat in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our biggest challenges to
producing these plants in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: or the high tunnel are the high yields we
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chalices that we've used were a
bit of a problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically in a field, you just get a fence
post and you pound it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bolt a two by four to it and put a
couple of wires in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're off and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem inside a high tunnel is
when your canes are spread out in a V like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it's a little bit hard to get down
the alleyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no flexibility on adjusting
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just clunky and not really
that strong, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working with a fella from
Indiana who has this company called
[SPEAKER_00]: Chalice Growing Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working on this new kind of trellis
that has the capacity to support the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of weight that you get from the
primate canes and the fruit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: produced on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of reinforced fiberglass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be stronger than steel,
but it has a little bit of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pound the post into the ground about a
foot and a little plate here that holds it
[SPEAKER_00]: square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bolt this aluminum piece onto it that
has pins in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you those pins in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can adjust the angle of these
trellis arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's wires here to support the
canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be adjusted and slip down this
trellis arm here to any height you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works pretty slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's black raspberries in an open
position with this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just pull out the pins
and close them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you more space for walking down
the alleyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you adjust it is you just pull
out the pins, move the bar, and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: the pins back in to whatever angle you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's developed a way to anchor them into
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't use a lot of space around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that space inside a high tunnel is
pretty valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these wires get pounded into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little device there that
catches about a foot down and provides
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these posts so they don't collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rows that we produce here,
our tunnels are the standard size is 30
[SPEAKER_00]: feet wide and 96 feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that four rows down the high
tunnel is best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of those rows are about seven and
a half feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives you enough space to work in
between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sides of the tunnels have a four foot
extension before the bend starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of tunnels, maybe for greens and
all, start to bend right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have our sides elevated four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get the two end rows of
raspberries relatively close to the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have that height there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the website of the company that
we're working with that has this flexible
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next presentation, Fumi's going to
be talking about how to use this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: system outdoors to bring protection to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a high tunnel and you
want to still cover them, you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them in such a way that they can bend down
and be covered with a high tunnel provided
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a decent trellis system to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high tunnel, I'll go through some
numbers here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do high tunnels cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pre-plant preparation, our tunnel
construction, plant establishment,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation trellis, we spent $11,000 and
$96.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we kept really good track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much it costs for everything
to build that tunnel, paying somebody and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, wow, that's a lot of money,
$11,000 for a 30 by 96 foot tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the harvest plants and the
produce to crop and all that, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: production costs and harvesting costs,
which you're going to have anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 half pints per tunnel, 250 a half
pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get about $10,000 of yield per tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you run those numbers out for
several years, so the first year you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any money coming in and you spent
nearly $12,000 without anything coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't sound so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, first year you have fruit,
you have to spend some money getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get $10,000 in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That offsets that initial cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second year, same thing, you're about
broke even.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nice thing is, from about year
three on, you have very little cost going
[SPEAKER_00]: into that tunnel, except for the
harvesting costs and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: production costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start running into the black
at a pretty high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had these tunnels looked at by
several economists and they all say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's about the best thing we've seen
in agriculture in terms of an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get payback within three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, the return is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every three or four years, you have to
replace the plastic and that costs you
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three or $400.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not three or $4,000, it's just a
few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that three or $400 cost every
three or four years happens whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: put the cover on just for the fall or you
leave it on year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you intercrop in year one and two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could put some maybe greens or
something like that in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have too many weeds growing between
your alleyways, I suppose you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the equivalent yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get about 20,000 pounds of fruit
per acre in a tunnel on a per acre basis
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to about 2,000 in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yield difference is dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our rows are about twice as close
together in the tunnel because we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: driving a tractor down the alleyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our harvest season is about two,
two and a half times longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, physiologically,
you saw those pictures of plants just grow
[SPEAKER_00]: better in a tunnel and the yield per plant
just seems to be so much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you multiply two by times 2.5 times
two, you get close to 10 times higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the yields are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the price you get for fruit off
season is higher than it is in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a store that we sell and it's
pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gross revenue is $150,000 per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done with greenhouse
production and pots the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time to get into a lot of
detail on that, but the same principles
[SPEAKER_00]: hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the plants in pots instead of in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a production bulletin on our
website that you can read all about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to end up, I just want to show
you some pictures of some growers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are doing pots, some are doing
ground, but the principles are sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simcoe, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we're real excited about the
fact that we can manipulate these
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries and blackberries in different
ways to provide fruit over a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like we have an opportunity
now in the northern tier of states to
[SPEAKER_00]: really make a dramatic impact on the time
of year that our berries are available and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a higher price and increase our yields
and increase the quality of fruit all at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Laura, that's about what I wanted to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a question about how often you
should replant the high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have not replanted our high tunnels
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had five years of raspberries growing
in the tunnels, and we haven't seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: decline in yield or growth or any increase
in diseases over that five-year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you outside that after five
years, you sometimes start to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts of the weather and diseases and
weeds and things like that, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with that in a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think 10 or 15 years, I think,
is not at all unreasonable for keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants in a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, no one's had tunnels that long,
so we don't know, but I think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable guess.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a question earlier,
and I may have been typing because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: when we lost the video, about the wind
speed of tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you address that, Marvin?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about the wind speed that caused
that first tunnel that you showed to fall
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a tunnel up at Geneva,
and that was installed in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hurricanes came up through,
and the wind speed was around 60 miles an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a haygrove tunnel, and the
haygroves are three-season tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not four-season tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not made to withstand a snow load,
nor are they made to withstand heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate thing here was that the
plastic was on that tunnel, and the wind
[SPEAKER_00]: came on a Sunday when no one was around to
take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, that plastic would have been
folded down and put in the V's of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel before that wind came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it was at the university,
and it was on a weekend, and we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really predict that high wind,
they kind of got caught, and the tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: got destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, you can deal with that just
by taking the plastic off before that wind
[SPEAKER_00]: comes through.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, if you folks can wait,
we have a couple more questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we will definitely get to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to make sure that I forgot to
introduce a couple of polls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do them, and then we'll
have Dr. Takeda give his presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I promise that we will make sure that
everyone's questions are answered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me introduce a couple of these poll
questions to help us get a better idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: the experience level of the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see how to answer them in just
a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me make sure they go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we get most everybody
voting, we'll move to the second one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says, are you currently growing
raspberries in high tunnels?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more than one season of experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have planted raspberries in a high
tunnel, but have just one season.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have not yet planted raspberries in
a high tunnel, but I'm seriously
[SPEAKER_03]: considering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, I have no plans on using a high
tunnel for raspberries or blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people could just give us that
feedback, that would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have about half of the group voting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you're all doing this,
I'll load up the next presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have anybody else want to
vote there?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got about 30 people out of 52 folks
that have voted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give you another second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, somebody has closed the poll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just hide that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll open up the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one asks if you are currently growing
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can answer that, yes, you are a
beginner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or yes, you have been growing them for
many years and need information on
[SPEAKER_03]: trellising and high tunnel possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, you do not plan to add
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackberries to your crop mix because of
temperature limitations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, you do not plan on adding
blackberries due to an unknown market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you are not currently growing
blackberries, but do plan on adding them
[SPEAKER_03]: to your crop mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you would just give us some
feedback, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got about 27.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can get up to about that 30 level or
so, that would be terrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm just going to close that
poll now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more poll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate Dr. Takeda's patience
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just talks about using adoption
of high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have been or still are the biggest
obstacles for your adoption of a high
[SPEAKER_03]: tunnel for a bramble crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial cost of the tunnel,
the cost of the labor involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: harvesting the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not know enough about managing the
crop in a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you are not sure that your market will
support the extended season and or the
[SPEAKER_03]: increased production that you might get in
a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can vote more than once on these.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we have a couple people that didn't
have the full view.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're an extension educator,
you really don't need to reply.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are a number of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do have any aspirations to grow
bramble crops, we'd love to get some
[SPEAKER_03]: feedback from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to shut that pod.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I would really like to,
it's my pleasure to introduce to you our
[SPEAKER_03]: second speaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is Dr. Fumiomi Takeda.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He works for the United States Department
of Agriculture, the Ag Research Station in
[SPEAKER_03]: Kearneysville, West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has been involved in developing year
round culture for strawberries,
[SPEAKER_03]: utilizing controlled environment,
protective covers, and soilless
[SPEAKER_03]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also has worked on optimizing
production of plantlets in soilless
[SPEAKER_03]: substrates for out of season fruit
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he studied the resource storage and
allocation of environmental factors that
[SPEAKER_03]: affect reproductive organ development in
strawberry and blackberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today he's going to be talking to us
about another trellis system for
[SPEAKER_03]: blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Takeda, I will turn off my
microphone and let you take over from
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to talk to you about a unique
trellising system we had developed here to
[SPEAKER_01]: train blackberries to facilitate
harvesting and to improve or reduce winter
[SPEAKER_01]: injury in both erect and trailing
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have grown blackberries in the
east, especially in the northeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll probably have seen plants look like
the shown in the plate A where a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: can in the springtime develop no flowering
shoots or they'll bear and kill back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can provide winter protection using the
things I'll be describing this afternoon,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as use high tunnels and
greenhouses to grow blackberries here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the northeast to reduce winter injury and
realize a reasonable amount of fruit in
[SPEAKER_01]: the summer, the following summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at some of the data published
by researchers, such as the bud hardiness
[SPEAKER_01]: of various blackberries, the thornless and
semi-arach blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're exposed to freezing
temperatures under controlled laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, when the buds are exposed to
temperatures around minus 10 Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_01]: about half the buds will be killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, the trailing blackberries
that have been developed in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest show 50% bug kill when
temperatures drop only down to plus 12
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the trailing blackberries are very
susceptible to low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin mentioned earlier about how to
reduce winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talked about using structures such as
greenhouses and high tunnels to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other options that one could consider
would be growing cold-tolerant varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that seem to be a little
hardier than others, such as Elin I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardy from the University of Illinois,
and I think the chest of thornless may do
[SPEAKER_01]: well in the southern Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also take action to reduce
winter injury by insulating the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as using structures and other
mulching materials, such as straw,
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic, foam, or just covering plants
with roll cover, or ice and snow in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain areas around the Great Lakes area.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these insulations would insulate
plants from the cold temperatures,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as protect plants from cold,
dry winter winds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to now talk to you about what we
have done here at the Kearneysville,
[SPEAKER_01]: West Virginia in the last 10-15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eastern varieties, such as Triple
Crown and Apache, do well in Zone 6,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they produce 25 to 30 pounds of fruit
per plant in the open system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they do not require any winter
protection to do well in the Mid-Atlantic
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast region.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the trailing varieties from
Oregon suffer severe winter injury in our
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're typically killed to the ground
every winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told by Jim Ballenton at NC
State, even in North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_01]: trailing varieties such as Siskiyou rarely
produce fruit because of winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Siskiyou, as I mentioned, was developed by
the USDA in Oregon, and does well in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, as well as in various parts in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it suffers severe injury when
temperature drops down to about 15 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what I'll be talking now is about this
simple winter protection system we have
[SPEAKER_01]: developed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it involves two ideas that Marvin may
have talked earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the use of this rotating cross arm,
or RCA trellis, and the application of
[SPEAKER_01]: floating roll cover over the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing the winter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rotating cross arm trellis,
the RCA, has a short post and a long cross
[SPEAKER_01]: arm that could be rotated about the post
and the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it's about 30 inches high,
with the cross arm that is about five feet
[SPEAKER_01]: in length.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are like four or five wires on
this long cross arm, and also has a
[SPEAKER_01]: station area short arm with a wire to
catch the lateral canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this main cross arm could be rotated
to manipulate the canopy of the blackberry
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system we have developed here has been
commercialized by a trellis growing system
[SPEAKER_01]: in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have the improved version for
sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trellis TGS system has components made
of fiberglass and some metal parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has these two arms, one long one
that could be rotated, and a short arm to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch the lateral canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a much better anchoring system
to keep the post cross arm stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: during the growing season than the system
we had developed here 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this RCA system does is that it
allows the blackberry plant canopy to be
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated during the growing season and
to position the fruit on one side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: row, shown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system allows about 95% of the fruit
to be positioned on one side of the row,
[SPEAKER_01]: making harvesting more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the system allows is that the for
primer canes to grow on this training
[SPEAKER_01]: wire, and eventually allow the lateral
canes to develop on these primer canes,
[SPEAKER_01]: develop many more lateral canes that are
five feet or more, so that the fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity of that plant is increased
tremendously because of the increased
[SPEAKER_01]: number of axillary buds or flower buds on
the long lateral canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the cross arm could be rotated
during the growing season, it's possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to rotate the lateral canes that are
trained on this long arm to be brought
[SPEAKER_01]: down close to the ground in the winter
months, and then that allows us to place
[SPEAKER_01]: the row cover on this low profile plant
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is this training done on the RCA
trellis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the blackberry plants have
primer canes and flower canes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and during the first growing season for
the plant, the primer canes emerge from
[SPEAKER_01]: the crown, and they grow upright in the
case of the erect and semi-erect
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, shown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the RCA trellis, what we do is
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once these primer canes reach beyond the
height of the training wire, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20 to 24 inches off the ground,
we force them to grow horizontally,
[SPEAKER_01]: as shown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bent and tied to this training
wire so that the primer canes grow
[SPEAKER_01]: sideways or horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, the tips of these primer
canes are here instead of growing straight
[SPEAKER_01]: upright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Takeda, there's a question about the
recommended numbers of buds in each
[SPEAKER_03]: lateral in this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, I got the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back one slide and show you
this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at using a pointer here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, click it on and then hold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the button turns dark, yeah,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the primer canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thornless blackberries tend to produce six
or seven primer canes during the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we limit the number of primer canes
that we train on this system to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three primer canes are tied to this
training wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the primer canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the question was about lateral canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here we have maybe four primer canes
trained up and tied to this training wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and as these bent primer canes reach
the adjacent plant, which is usually five
[SPEAKER_01]: to six feet away, those tips are cut off
or tipped, which promotes the axillary
[SPEAKER_01]: buds along the horizontal portion of these
three primer canes to develop and then
[SPEAKER_01]: lateral canes emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this system, we try to let all the
lateral canes develop along the horizontal
[SPEAKER_01]: portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're leaving, training three primer
canes and allowing them to grow maybe five
[SPEAKER_01]: feet or so, and that five foot length,
there could be 20 nodes here along this
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, you expect to see about 70% of
those lateral or axillary buds to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: lateral shoots or secondary canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our system, we're getting about seven
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: of long lateral canes, and since there are
three primer canes, we could train about
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 lateral canes up on this long rotating
cross arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a photo taken later in the summer
or early winter showing that in this
[SPEAKER_01]: system, in this case, we have trained two
primer canes and bent them to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontally, and then in this five foot
span, we have about 14 lateral canes that
[SPEAKER_01]: have developed, and they tend to grow
upright if you manage them properly and
[SPEAKER_01]: get tremendous length on these lateral
canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we've got a lateral cane growing
straight up to the top wire which is about
[SPEAKER_01]: five feet of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this photo, the plants were established
six feet apart within the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the lateral canes are tied to the
wires on this long rotating cross arm,
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire cross arm could be rotated so
that the lateral canes are now very close
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: and floating row cover could be placed
over these plants, shown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we do all this to grow blackberries
in the Mid-Atlantic Coast region?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I showed you earlier, varieties such as
sesquiu and other trailing blackberries
[SPEAKER_01]: from Oregon are so tender that they're
winter-killed, like here shown with the
[SPEAKER_01]: lateral canes with no growth, and that any
fruiting shoots that develop in the spring
[SPEAKER_01]: are really scarce on these lateral canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some flowering shoots or
fruiting shoots that develop on the main
[SPEAKER_01]: cane or the horizontal portion of the
cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question here is about cane
breakage.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this training system, we rarely get
cane breakage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is that by bending the primer
canes to about 90 degrees and then forcing
[SPEAKER_01]: them, those canes grow horizontally,
and then allowing the lateral canes to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop more in an upright orientation,
allow us to rotate the entire canopy as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as 110 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without breaking the main cane,
because we're not really bending the cane
[SPEAKER_01]: during this canopy manipulation,
but twisting the canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These canes tolerate more the twisting
than actual bending, so we're not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: much breakage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some breakage during the early
summer, when the primer canes are being
[SPEAKER_01]: trained up and then bent to grow
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have shown that maybe we get
about 5% or so of the primer canes break
[SPEAKER_01]: because of mishandling of these primer
canes during the bending operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we lose very few canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we lose one of those primer canes or
cause break, then we will then yank that
[SPEAKER_01]: cane out and allow another primer cane
that emerged from the crown to take its
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: By using this type of training system,
we are able to get about 14-15 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit from Siskiyou trailing blackberry,
which is about an average production in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of triple crown in Apache,
which do not need any winter protection,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have harvested about 30 pounds of fruit
per plant at five foot or six foot
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, shown on the left, plant that was
not protected in the winter, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: shown on the right, plant that was trained
on the RCA trellis, with the canes
[SPEAKER_01]: positioned close to the ground,
and then covered with the floating roll
[SPEAKER_01]: cover, we're getting good fruit
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some data from our studies
performed between the year 2002 and 2009
[SPEAKER_01]: for variety Siskiyou.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are able to advance the bloom by about
seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is caused by the application of roll
covers up to early March or just prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: bud break, so by adding a little bit of
field heat to the plant in early spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're able to advance their development
and achieve as much as one week earliness
[SPEAKER_01]: and bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that were trained to the RCA
trellis and then covered with floating
[SPEAKER_01]: roll cover in the winter produce 14 pounds
of fruit per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have the Siskiyou trained to a
conventional trellis or IOT pole system,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not cover, those plants produce less
than two pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are trained to an upright cane
training system and covered in a vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: orientation, we got close to five pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this low productivity, it will not be
worth growing varieties such as Siskiyou
[SPEAKER_01]: in the system in here in the east.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're trained to the RCA,
and covered during the winter months,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can achieve much higher yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other benefits to RCA trellis
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that you can harvest more fruit in
a given time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data we have collected in the past show
that as much as 30% increase in harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency this is due in part to having
95% of the fruit on one side of the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to pick the rows of
blackberries from both sides of the row,
[SPEAKER_01]: but concentrate picking fruit from one
side because almost all the fruit will be
[SPEAKER_01]: positioned on one side of the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if rows run east-west, and you could
rotate the whole canopy to the north side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the row, fruit will be in a partial
shade or complete shade and not be exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to direct sunlight, so there is less
sunburn damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the fruit temperatures we have
recorded in the summertime indicated that
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit on the south side of the row had
skin temperature as much as 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees or 25 degrees higher than the
fruit on the north side of the row and in
[SPEAKER_01]: partial shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having lower fruit temperature,
you probably have a much better post
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I have discussed today is a
non-tunnel winter protection system.
[SPEAKER_01]: To reduce winter cane injury and reduce
tissue desiccation during winter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to extend blackberry
production to areas with more severe
[SPEAKER_01]: winter conditions, places like northern
Pennsylvania, New York, and perhaps into
[SPEAKER_01]: New England states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both erect and trading cultivars can be
trained to RCA trellis and managed with
[SPEAKER_01]: winter protection to improve productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that completes my presentation and we
could take questions if you have time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linda, there was one question about was
the conventional open treatment,
[SPEAKER_03]: was that an open V or a different
trellising system?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this study, what we did was to train
the lateral canes on the RCA cross arm and
[SPEAKER_01]: then lift the canes upright to the winter
months instead of bringing them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either cover with row cover or lift
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you train blackberries to other
systems, you will probably get similar
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The canes that are vertically trained and
upright would be exposed to much colder
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures than the canes that are
brought down close to the ground and
[SPEAKER_01]: covered with row cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have any questions for
Dr. Takeda?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we had a couple of unanswered
questions for Dr. Pritz, but now is your
[SPEAKER_03]: chance folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was another question on
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 700 plants per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of Chester, Thornless,
and Apache, we have harvested about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of Siskiyou, we are harvesting
around 14 pounds per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since these plantings were established for
mechanical harvesting many years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are planting rows about 12 feet
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure all these varieties could be
grown at much closer spacing, say about a
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 foot row spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Marvin, if you're still
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe as people type in questions for Dr.
Takeda, but I know that there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: question earlier about the use of movable
tunnels with raspberries or blackberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any experience with that,
but theoretically it's an intriguing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly if you had the summer
blackberries and the fall blackberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: or summer raspberries and fall
blackberries, you could move the tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: over the fall berries for just that late
season crop, for say from September
[SPEAKER_00]: through November to when you were done,
and then you could slide the tunnel back
[SPEAKER_00]: over the four cane fruiting crop that
needed the winter protection and use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get double use out of the tunnel if
you could have a rail system or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to slide it back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not even raspberries, but greens or
something that needed some winter
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's an intriguing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done it, but people are talking
about it, and it'll be interesting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of years to see if people have
figured out ways to make that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a question here for Dr.
Takeda.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best orientation to the sun?
[SPEAKER_03]: In your opinion, for those blackberries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you are using the RCA trellis,
we're recommending that the rows be
[SPEAKER_01]: established east-west orientation so that
the fruit could be positioned to the north
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the disease treasures, we thought,
but when we were doing mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting work and rotated the fruiting,
the cross arm, to about a 30 degree about
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal, we were getting a lot less
Japanese beetle damage because the berries
[SPEAKER_01]: were all kind of hanging from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another concern though with the
fungal problems such as anthracnals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So row covers must be removed just prior
to bud break in late winter or early
[SPEAKER_01]: spring, then apply the liquid lime sulfur
to control anthracnals problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to jump in too because there was
a question about insects in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel if we get increased insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our experience, we get increased
mites that we have to watch out for,
[SPEAKER_00]: two-spotted spider mites, but otherwise we
have very few other problems that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No diseases to manage and the only insect
are increased mites because it's drier and
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have to pay attention to mites,
but nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wanted to make a comment too
about row orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Fumi did, we also recommend positioning
our rows east-west for the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're doing field production,
we recommend north-south orientation
[SPEAKER_00]: because you get better line interception
when the rows are planted north-south so
[SPEAKER_00]: the south side of the row and north side
of the row get exposure when the sun comes
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the east and sets in the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a tunnel, particularly late in the
season, if you want to get the most light
[SPEAKER_00]: intercepted when the sun's low in the
south of the sky, you want your rows
[SPEAKER_00]: planted east-west so the south side of the
east-west row gets the most exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: the southern sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for that late season
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a couple of questions I
think for Dr. Takeda talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: training this year's primocane over the
top of next year's floricane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then wondering about trellising
systems used in the primocane production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not completely sure, Dr. Takeda,
if I understand that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, about the primocane training over
next year's, or not next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: current year's floricane that has fruit,
I would recommend that they go to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the files that they could upload.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these reports provide very detailed
procedure for manipulating the canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what the RCA Trullis has, two wires at
the height of that post, the one training
[SPEAKER_01]: wire on the side with the short arm,
that is the wire on which the primocanes
[SPEAKER_01]: are trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lateral canes that emerge
from the horizontal portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: primocane are trained to contain their
growth between the two cross arms,
[SPEAKER_01]: the long cross arm and the short.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the angle created with the
wires on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to keep those lateral
canes growing within those two cross arms,
[SPEAKER_01]: so angle created by those two arms of the
trellis, and then kind of confine their
[SPEAKER_01]: growth to more or less in a vertical
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to draw everybody's
attention while you're in this phase of
[SPEAKER_03]: the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can click on these different handouts
and bulletins.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quite a number of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are a little large,
but you can still click on them,
[SPEAKER_03]: upload them right to your computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will keep the digital classroom open
so that people can do that if they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll also be able to do that from
the archived presentation if you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: log off.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a question about how level does a
site need to be for a high tunnel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they be placed on a slope?
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvin, do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see a few questions here for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is probably a level site is the most
important thing you can have for a high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy these kits, they're
engineered for having a perfectly level
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's one thing you can do,
that's make sure that site is as level as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go up a whole lot better and be
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't seen anybody placing them on
a slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from the engineering point of
view, it would be just really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a level site I think is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Charleston system we used for the
primocane blackberry production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the system I showed you where we
could basically train the canes upright
[SPEAKER_00]: but into a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could bring some of the canes over
to one side and some to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for primocane blackberries,
mostly we're just interested in holding
[SPEAKER_00]: the canes upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing a whole lot of
manipulation on primocane fruiting crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the question on rodents in a high
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mowed around the high tunnels real
close to the ground, the grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: before fall came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put up chicken wire around the
outside to try to keep the rodents from
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also tried to secure the tunnel
itself as much as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just have to keep an eye on it
to make sure it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and a question about the Chinese
method based on building the earth on the
[SPEAKER_00]: north side of the tunnel and it's built
into the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to China and I've seen those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tunnel itself is still,
the soil underneath it, it's still level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make that arch up and it goes
into the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's on slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part that's planted is still
pretty flat and level.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the tunnels that I saw over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we answered one question
about venting the tunnel in September and
[SPEAKER_03]: October.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do believe that that's an important
thing to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to comment on
that, Marvin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we keep the tunnels vented almost,
I won't say year round, but certainly when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any amount of heat that can
accumulate in a tunnel, you want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it vented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even on cold days, say November,
we'll have the vents open at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll leave the sides up maybe six
inches or so just to allow some air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement to come in and move through so it
doesn't get so humid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it really cold weather
comes, like we have now, we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down to the ground and the
vents closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we try to vent a fair amount,
if nothing else, to keep the humidity from
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through because the plants do
better when the humidity is not too
[SPEAKER_00]: awfully high in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more question for Dr. Takita.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which types of plants should be used?
[SPEAKER_03]: Erect, semi-erect,
[SPEAKER_03]: foamed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think both types of varieties could be
trained to RCA trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even trailing blackberries work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the primocanes emerge from the crown
and they're still 25 inches tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all can be bent about 90 degrees
to force them to grow sideways or
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all can be trained to RCA trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some cases where we do have
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be some vigorous primocanes
emerge very early in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be like one-inch in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're more difficult to bend than
slightly smaller primocanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put up the last poll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're a little bit over on the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think that the discussion and
the questions have been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate everybody staying
in there for the full length.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any further questions,
don't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are officially done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to leave this so that people
can download the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wouldn't mind just putting your
last poll response there, that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our next webinar will be on
January 20th, two weeks from today at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be talking about weed management
and brambles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all will be receiving an email
notification about the connection
[SPEAKER_03]: information prior to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know of people that might enjoy
that topic, please don't hesitate to let
[SPEAKER_03]: them know about the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do need to register separately.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we would love to continue to grow this
program in the final phase of the webinar
[SPEAKER_03]: series.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody can't see all the choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll open that up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all very much for attending.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you mostly to Dr. Fumiomi Takita
and Dr. Marvin Pritz for your
[SPEAKER_03]: presentations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And enjoy the cold weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fumi, I don't know if you see that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question here from Brett Bindix
about growing a plant that produces 14
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds versus a plant that produces 30
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what this individual is talking
about is the difference between a high
[SPEAKER_03]: tunnel and a regular just growing it
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the question probably relates to
Siskiyou, which produces 14 pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to Triple Crown or Apache that
produces 30 pounds.
I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is he still on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brent, the reason that we're trying to
grow Siskiyou in the Eastern United States
[SPEAKER_01]: is that it's a very early ripening
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could start harvesting Siskiyou here in
mid-June compared to around July 10th for
[SPEAKER_01]: Apache and Triple Crown and much later for
some other varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by growing trailing varieties such as
Siskiyou, one could extend the picking
[SPEAKER_01]: season by two, three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three weeks and get the early crop of
blackberries before the Japanese beetles
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of the ground and cause a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could pick blackberries earlier
in the summer, I think the grower can get
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher price for these early varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that answered it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think everybody is pretty much
signing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, thank you so much, Dr. Takeda
and Marvin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of you folks, I will leave the
classroom on so that you can continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: download.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this archive will be available in
just a few days on the Berry website,
[SPEAKER_03]: as are all the previous eight webinars,
plus a few that we did last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're welcome to take a peek at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you again and we'll see you in a
couple of weeks.
Thank you very much.
