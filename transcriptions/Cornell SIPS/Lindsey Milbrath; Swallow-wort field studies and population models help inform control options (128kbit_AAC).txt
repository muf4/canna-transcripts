[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Tony said, I did give a seminar
about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the work that I'm going to present
today was actually in process at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's mostly been completed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to look at some of the field-based
studies and modeling efforts that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been pursuing to help inform control for
these troublesome weed swallowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I begin, though, I'd like to
acknowledge key collaborators and helpers
[SPEAKER_05]: in the projects that I'll be discussing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jeremy Biazzo, who is the support
scientist in my lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Adam Davis, who is a plant ecologist
with ARS in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the population modeler for the work
that I'll be showing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Tony mentioned, I'd like to
acknowledge the very fruitful and
[SPEAKER_05]: long-standing collaboration I have with
Tony and his group, specifically also
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck Muller and Scott Morris for the work
I'll be presenting today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also acknowledge some of the land
managers, land owners who gave us access
[SPEAKER_05]: to the properties for the population work
that I'll be presenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those who may not yet be introduced
to the swallowers, or dog strangling vines
[SPEAKER_05]: as they are called in Ontario,
these are milkweed relatives from Europe
[SPEAKER_05]: in the family Apocynaceae.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two species in particular are problematic
here in North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pale swalloward goes by the name
Vincetoxicum rossicum, although you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: also see it referred to as Sinansum
rossicum, depending on what source you go
[SPEAKER_05]: to.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant is native to parts of eastern
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second species is black
swalloward, Vincetoxicum nigram,
[SPEAKER_05]: also known as Sinansum louiseae,
native to western Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these were introduced sometime in
the mid to late 1800s, but only since
[SPEAKER_05]: about the 1970s, 80s have they become
particularly abundant in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both species are long-lived herbaceous
perennials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the spring they produce one to
several twining stems from a subterranean
[SPEAKER_05]: root crown.
[SPEAKER_05]: By late summer fall they are producing
windblown seed, which is how the species
[SPEAKER_05]: are propagated, how populations spread and
increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way to tell the two species apart
are by the flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the left are these dark purple
flowers with little white hairs on the
[SPEAKER_05]: surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's black swalloward flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the right are these pink to maroon
colored hairless petal flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pale swalloward.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the diagnostic character to
use to distinguish the two species.
[SPEAKER_05]: These maps really haven't been updated
much, but for the most part this is still
[SPEAKER_05]: a northeastern issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the biggest infestations occur in
southern Ontario, New York, and New
[SPEAKER_05]: England, with probably increasing,
I'm not sure, increasing populations or
[SPEAKER_05]: just increasing awareness of swallowards
in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin, and the like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these species grow in a wide variety of
habitats under a wide variety of
conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different soil types, pHs, disturbance
levels, and light levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by far the most dense, most productive
infestations of swallowards occur in open
[SPEAKER_05]: field, high-light environments,
through to these forest edge habitats to
[SPEAKER_05]: some very moderately dense infestations
even in forest understories, including
[SPEAKER_05]: deeply shaded forest environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so over the years a number of economic
and ecological problems have been
[SPEAKER_05]: identified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Swallowards are mainly in natural areas or
environmental weed, but they can also be a
[SPEAKER_05]: weed problem in perennial cropping systems
such as pastures, Christmas tree farms,
[SPEAKER_05]: may be interfering with forest
regeneration due to the smothering growth
[SPEAKER_05]: that the vines have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this dense growth is also not very
favored by insect communities,
[SPEAKER_05]: grassland bird communities, really very
little feeds on or damages swalloward in
[SPEAKER_05]: North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a number of years there have been
limited control options available.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the present time, herbicides are still
probably the most effective means of
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling these species.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the herbicides that are available are
broad spectrum, specifically triclopyr,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a broad leaf herbicide,
and then glyphosate, which is all plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it can be expensive to use these
products, especially of large acreages to
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult sometimes to get into
certain areas like forest understories,
[SPEAKER_05]: and some places really don't want to use,
like state parks really prefer not to use
[SPEAKER_05]: herbicides to control invasives on their
properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mechanical control, there have been very
studies done over the years also looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at mechanical control, which has mostly
been considered ineffective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the only effective way to rid
yourself of a swalloward infestation is if
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a small patch that you can take a
shovel to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dig out the root stocks, put them in a
bag, let them rot to mush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhat disturbing, but that's probably
the best way to get rid of these plants
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, mowing, mulching, hand pulling,
all that's really going to do for you is
[SPEAKER_05]: to remove pods and therefore reduce seed
output that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're particularly vigilant and you
get all the pods, you might be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: completely suppress reproduction unless
you have seed blowing in from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the plants are going to remain there
to reflower the following year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biologically, early on, it was sort of
unclear how these plants would respond to
[SPEAKER_05]: insect feeding damage or any kind of
herbivore damage because, as I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was really nothing feeding on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the studies that I had done several
years ago was an artificial defoliation
[SPEAKER_05]: study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can see here, I used individual
potted plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stripped the leaves off to varying
degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: The take home message from this particular
study was that maybe a combination of
[SPEAKER_05]: defoliation and low light stress deep
shade could be effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: But under higher light conditions,
repeated defoliation was absolutely going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be necessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then, it's not clear how
effective that would be in the long run.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for all these different, especially the
mechanical and biological studies that
[SPEAKER_05]: have been done, they all have limitations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either by nature or design, they were all
very short term in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: One to two years at most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet for most perennials, as we know,
they usually grow and maintain a very
[SPEAKER_05]: large root mass from which they have a lot
of reserves that they can use to recover
[SPEAKER_05]: from damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are long lived perennials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they may live on the order of a couple
of decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not actually sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a two year study, 20 year lifespan,
we needed to extend the duration of some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these control studies just to get a
better sense of how helpful they are in
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling swallowworms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another issue is, at least for some of
these artificial defoliation studies,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, these were done in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: A common criticism is that, how well do
these type of results transfer to a field
[SPEAKER_05]: setting?
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not be applicable at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also by design, a lot of these studies
are focused on single plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the response of a single plant does
not necessarily tell you the response of a
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for these reasons, we wanted to look at
some longer term studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one I'm going to present,
this was done in collaboration with Tony's
[SPEAKER_05]: lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a multi-year, six year field
study conducted out at Caldwell Field,
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at artificial defoliation as a
surrogate for biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_05]: And clipping as a surrogate for mowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a biocontrol, mechanical control type
study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we did here is we transplanted
root stocks of the two species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we suppressed surrounding vegetation
using mown grass alleyways, and then we
[SPEAKER_05]: transplanted into these landscape cloth
strips.
[SPEAKER_05]: One key thing I want to point out is that
we did allow these root stocks to regrow
[SPEAKER_05]: for one whole year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you dig up swallower root
stocks, you're really cutting off like 95%
[SPEAKER_05]: of the root mass when you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're setting them up for a
disadvantage right at the start of a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to allow them to recover and at
least sort of have a larger root mass to
[SPEAKER_05]: begin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that year of recovery,
we had one of eight different damage
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments that we would impose on certain
plants every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had undamaged controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we also had as part of the sort of
the biocontrol approach, we used a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: different levels of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 50% defoliation where we cut the leaves
in half.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also cut the stem tips off because
oftentimes insects will feed on the apical
[SPEAKER_05]: meristems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So naturally you often get bushier lower
growing plants because of the branching
[SPEAKER_05]: that occurs from the insect damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to include that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of these plants were defoliated
just once a growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some were defoliated twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because we often have insects that
may only have one generation of summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll just give us one round of
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we can probably can expect at
most two generations of a leaf feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: insect in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other plants were then defoliated 100% so
we stripped the leaves and cut the stem
[SPEAKER_05]: tips on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't necessarily the best picture,
but you can see we have basically sticks
[SPEAKER_05]: waving in the breeze when we're done with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did that either once or twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with the clipping, the mowing
surrogate, we clipped at eight centimeter
[SPEAKER_05]: height, which is about three inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a common mowing height.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either at one or two times a season,
which was comparable to a lot of previous
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanical control studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we added a four times a year
clipping study to sort of push the
[SPEAKER_05]: envelope on terms of the high frequency
mowing, which we figured was probably the
[SPEAKER_05]: most that land managers might be willing
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was on a monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then at the end of the growing season in
September, for a subset of plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'd annually look at survival,
stem number, branching number,
[SPEAKER_05]: pod number, so seed output.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other plants we would, other groups of
plants would be destructively harvested
[SPEAKER_05]: for plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: After one, two, four, or six seasons of
damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did we see?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did the plants respond?
[SPEAKER_05]: So these graphs, which were taken from a
publication that came out last year,
[SPEAKER_05]: they all have the same form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the bottom x-axis are the different
damage treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to the left, we have this least
damaging artificial defoliation treatment
[SPEAKER_05]: through to the more severe defoliation
treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have the three different clipping
treatments in the control on the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if you're looking at the letters,
we looked at differences across years,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just within individual damage
treatments to keep the graph a little
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we see, now this graph shows stem
number per plant, which is sort of an
[SPEAKER_05]: indication of size of plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because previous work that had been done
actually by Christine Averill showed that
[SPEAKER_05]: plants will increase in the number of
stems that they can produce and support as
[SPEAKER_05]: they mature in age.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're seeing here is for most of
these damage treatments, the plants are
[SPEAKER_05]: increasingly getting larger, producing
more stems every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: With one exception, the plants that were
clipped four times a growing season,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically we did not see a significant
increase in stem number production.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for all the other damage treatments,
they were increasing in size.
[SPEAKER_05]: Above ground dry mass, just maybe a little
bit more comprehensive way to look at top
[SPEAKER_05]: growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: This includes stem, leaf, and pod biomass
combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we're seeing either a
significant increase in the case of the
[SPEAKER_05]: controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for both species of swallow work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some non-significant trends for an
increase in dry mass or maybe they're
[SPEAKER_05]: stalling out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we only had one treatment where we saw
a significant decrease in above ground dry
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass over the years of the study,
which was this, again, clipping four times
[SPEAKER_05]: a season.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I'll point out is that the
black swallow work dry mass was greater
[SPEAKER_05]: than pale swallow work dry mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a result we sort of expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black swallow really seems to put more
resources into growing stems and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially pods and seeds relative to
pale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of seed production,
and this is a little bit busy,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's sort of a simple message,
so we had the two swallow work species
[SPEAKER_05]: really, except for some sporadic kind of
fluctuations in seed output, which I think
[SPEAKER_05]: is probably more dependent on that
particular year's environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really saw no change in seed output
across any of these damage treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will point out for these clipping
treatments, especially the clipping twice,
[SPEAKER_05]: very little seed was produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants that were clipped four times,
no seed was produced any year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, we're cutting them so late in the
season they have no time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although they did re-flower, they had no
time to mature seed within the growing
[SPEAKER_05]: season.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we really were interested in is
what's happening below ground?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times you might not see much of a
change on the surface, but if you go below
[SPEAKER_05]: ground over time, maybe we're causing that
root mass to shrink.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reserves are being used up,
and that's what we like to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just point this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did actually invest in a rather nifty
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually a tree root ball
excavator.
[SPEAKER_05]: We chose to do that rather than using
shovels to dig out these big root masses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is sort of a nice way to do
science and get a great workout at the
[SPEAKER_05]: same time, or hurt yourself if you're not
careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, what we saw for both
species is that, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_05]: regardless of damage treatment,
the root mass was increasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was increasing every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were not stressing these plants out so
much that they were not able to put on new
[SPEAKER_05]: root growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: There may have been some trends for some
of these severe defoliation treatments,
[SPEAKER_05]: but really the only treatment that we saw
no increase from the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_05]: experiment to the end in root mass was for
the plants to clip four times a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these plants were just basically
maintaining the root mass they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't put any on anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that said, they also weren't losing
root mass either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And another expected result was that pale
swallowed had much larger root mass than
[SPEAKER_05]: black swallowed, about three times as much
dry mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is one of these species
differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in summary, these two species display a
very high tolerance to above ground tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: loss, at least under full sun conditions
and with minimal plant competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's tempting to wonder, well,
if we'd had plant competition,
[SPEAKER_05]: either high densities of conspecific
swallow work competition or old field
[SPEAKER_05]: grass golden rod competition, maybe that
would have altered the outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as it stands, that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of mechanical control,
so this is sort of informing what you
[SPEAKER_05]: might do mechanically, clipping four times
per season was the only damage that
[SPEAKER_05]: prevented growth and repercussions on
productive output.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't mention this earlier,
but we didn't kill a single plant with
[SPEAKER_05]: this approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sort of begs the question,
how many more years would we have had to
[SPEAKER_05]: have done the study to start killing these
plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flip side is, if you're a land manager
and you've been mowing and mowing and
[SPEAKER_05]: mowing and you get tired of this because
nothing's going away and you just quit,
[SPEAKER_05]: these plants are still there and they're
going to start regrowing probably and
[SPEAKER_05]: increasing in size.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are tough ombres.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of a sort of a biocontrol
application, at least using this
[SPEAKER_05]: artificial defoliation method,
the most severe defoliation treatment that
[SPEAKER_05]: we imposed, which was complete defoliation
twice a season, which is probably the most
[SPEAKER_05]: we could expect of a leaf feeding
biocontrol agent in the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_05]: really did not significantly reduce
swallow performance relative to any
[SPEAKER_05]: undamaged plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really calls into question,
in an open field setting, the potential
[SPEAKER_05]: efficacy of any kind of leaf feeding
biocontrol agent you might introduce.
[SPEAKER_05]: But having said that, the study was again
focused on individual plants and adult
[SPEAKER_05]: plants at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do these results really apply to a
population of different life stages in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field, maybe under less optimal growing
conditions?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for that, I did some plant population
modeling work with Adam Davis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, there's something called
stage-based matrix modeling, which can be
[SPEAKER_05]: a very powerful tool for identifying key
life stage transitions that contribute the
[SPEAKER_05]: most to population growth of an invasive
plant, and hence you would want to target
[SPEAKER_05]: for disruption.
[SPEAKER_05]: In turn, then, if that can help inform
pre-release recommendations for particular
[SPEAKER_05]: biocontrol agents, you might want to
prioritize for release if they can give
[SPEAKER_05]: you that kind of damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have actually been a number of
studies, which I've listed on the screen
[SPEAKER_05]: here, that have looked at matrix modeling
from the perspective of weed biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these have been retrospective
after the fact studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the biocontrol programs may have been
in place for years or decades even,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the researchers come in,
apply these population models,
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically say, well, if we could make
recommendations at this point for what
[SPEAKER_05]: agents to release, would that match the
actual results we're seeing from these
[SPEAKER_05]: existing biocontrol programs?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does seem to be a fruitful way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, there's really been no
prospective pre-release type use of these
[SPEAKER_05]: studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: One exception, at least in North America,
involves garlic mustard, and this is work
[SPEAKER_05]: actually done by Adam Davis and
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the present time, there's been no
biocontrol agents approved for release
[SPEAKER_05]: against garlic mustard, although maybe
that will happen, but we've been waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: for many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at present, it's sort of untested.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been waiting for this approach,
at least using it in a pre-release
[SPEAKER_05]: recommendation form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those that may not be familiar with
this, I just want to go through,
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of give a brief primer on how you
develop these kind of studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use garlic mustard as the
example because it's got a simple two-year
[SPEAKER_05]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you do is you divide up the
population into discrete life stages.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case of garlic mustard,
we have seeds at the top, rosettes,
[SPEAKER_05]: and adult flowering plants on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can graphically represent
this in terms of what's called a loop
[SPEAKER_05]: diagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have the same three life stages in
the circles.
[SPEAKER_05]: The arrows represent transitions within or
between life stages over the course of one
[SPEAKER_05]: whole year, and you can represent these
arrows by equations composed of vital
[SPEAKER_05]: rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So germination, survival, death rates,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can then write these equations in
the form of a matrix, which is where you
[SPEAKER_05]: get the name matrix modeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You use matrix algebra.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go into those kind of
details.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have a collaborator.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we have to do is collect
demographic data from the field for these
[SPEAKER_05]: invasive plants that we're wanting to
study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you conduct different kinds of
analyses.
[SPEAKER_05]: One common one used is called elasticity
analyses, which is used to identify these
[SPEAKER_05]: influential life stage transitions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can perturb the model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you alter different parts of the life
cycle by certain amounts just to see how
[SPEAKER_05]: does that affect overall population
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one way to do that is to
incorporate insect impact data into the
[SPEAKER_05]: model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many of you have seen this before.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the loop diagram for the swallow
warts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, long-lived perennial species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have five life stages in this
particular model.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dormant seed in the soil seed bank,
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vegetative juveniles, which can persist in
a vegetative state for years until they
[SPEAKER_05]: transition to a flowering state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we divided these up into two different
stages of flowering, a small flowering,
[SPEAKER_05]: which has one to two stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then large flowering, which had three
or more stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sort of a size stage classification
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what the matrix of equations looks
like in this case.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those different deterministic
equations are composed of vital rates of
[SPEAKER_05]: germination, survival, growth or
maturation, or reversion to different life
[SPEAKER_05]: stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then fecundity is measured by viable
seeds per plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is a density-independent
approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually replace these
deterministic equations with functions if
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to make it a density-dependent
type of modeling, which we did not do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we collected data from six
different populations of swallowwort
[SPEAKER_05]: around the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two locations of pale swallowwort
in central and northern New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: In each of those locations we had both an
open field and an adjacent forest
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had two black swallowwort
field populations in the Hudson River
[SPEAKER_05]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only in the field because black
swallowwort is much less commonly
[SPEAKER_05]: encountered in forests.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is present, but not nearly to the
extent that we see for pale swallowwort.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then using marked individuals and
transects and sowing plots, we collect
[SPEAKER_05]: this data for the model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the elasticity analysis, I'm just going
to present sort of real briefly just what
[SPEAKER_05]: this looks like, at least as far as Adam
Davis has provided this information to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, elasticity refers to identifying
these influential life stage transitions
[SPEAKER_05]: for population growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing you want to see is the
higher the elasticity value here on the
[SPEAKER_05]: y-axis, the more influential that
transition is, depending on what
[SPEAKER_05]: particular transition you're looking at,
which is called parameter here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll skip to just one example to show how
to read this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the populations of pale
swallowwort, in this case at a site called
[SPEAKER_05]: Great Gully, where we had both a field and
a forest population, the influential
[SPEAKER_05]: transitions.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the field population included some
survival rates, juveniles and small
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering plants, some growth rates and
reproductive output of small flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the adjacent forest, which was a
heavily shaded forest environment,
[SPEAKER_05]: and in this case the swallowwort
population is just sort of hanging on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very slow growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were only two transitions that came
out, one involving juveniles and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially this one involving small
flowering survival.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very influential for that population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this table is just a summary of the
elasticity outputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put it up here for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to show you that for the six
populations of swallowwort that we looked
[SPEAKER_05]: at, if you look at the middle of the
table, we have a lot of similarities in
[SPEAKER_05]: what transitions were important for these
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they crossed over between the two
swallowwort species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had pale swallowwort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And black swallowwort have these same
survival, growth and reproductive
[SPEAKER_05]: transitions that are important for growing
those populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's common, but we also have some
site specific differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I already mentioned, we have this one
pale swallowwort forest population that's
[SPEAKER_05]: acting very differently than the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has different transitions involving
survival, especially of small flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: stage plants is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have on the opposite side
a black swallowwort population that is in
[SPEAKER_05]: this case very rapidly growing at the
Dutchess County.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in this particular population's
case, we have a lot of transitions that
[SPEAKER_05]: involve large flowering stages,
which we did not see in the other
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, there's some context dependent
results, different population dynamics
[SPEAKER_05]: that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what are called contour maps of
lambda.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what Adam Davis has provided to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they show are projected changes
in population growth rate as indicated by
[SPEAKER_05]: these lines relative to changes in this
particular case seed production here on
[SPEAKER_05]: the x-axis or seedling survival on the
y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I'm using these two parameters
here is because number one, they were
[SPEAKER_05]: identified as being influential from these
elasticity analyses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have insect impact data that
are related to these two, which I'll show
[SPEAKER_05]: you in a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So lambda refers to population growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lambda value of one is a sort of a
steady state population.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not growing or shrinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on these graphs, anything to the right
of the lambda one labeled curve indicates
[SPEAKER_05]: a growing population.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything to the left indicates a
shrinking population.
[SPEAKER_05]: To help you read these graphs,
too, they're not intuitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this top left graph here, this x here
on the top corner indicates the current
[SPEAKER_05]: projected population growth rate if
nothing else changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the value is greater than 1.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a growing population.
[SPEAKER_05]: As opposed to this population here,
here's the one just sort of barely
[SPEAKER_05]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all the rest of these are increasing
very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to consider, well,
how is population growth going to change
[SPEAKER_05]: if I reduce seed output alone,
you would figure that out by running along
[SPEAKER_05]: the top axis here and seeing when you get
to this number one labeled curve,
[SPEAKER_05]: drop down, and you'd say, well,
for this population, if I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately stop population growth,
I'd have to reduce seed output by 90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alternatively, if I want to only reduce
seedling survival, I'd measure that on
[SPEAKER_05]: this right curve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like I'd have to completely
eliminate seedling survival for that
[SPEAKER_05]: population to cause population to stop
growing at that location.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have combinations that I can
consider all in this part of the graph.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I only have to reduce seedling
survival by 50% and 25% seedling seed
[SPEAKER_05]: output, and I could get the same result.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a lot of combinations
potentially available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do that for all the different
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can change the parameters and look
at the different combinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably one of the drawbacks of
this approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only look at two parameters
simultaneously, even though we may have
[SPEAKER_05]: six or more available.
[SPEAKER_05]: But visually, it's an easy way to see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on these population modeling this
work, what might it take to suppress
[SPEAKER_05]: swallow work populations?
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, whatever kind of control tool
you want to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to reduce survival of flowering
stages, sort of like what we were
[SPEAKER_05]: attempting to do in the field study I
showed you at the beginning of the talk,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'd have to reduce survival maybe from 5%
in some of these forest environments to
[SPEAKER_05]: 90% in some of the field environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these populations, that alone,
was going to be insufficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you remember from the field study,
we didn't kill anything, with mowing at
[SPEAKER_05]: least.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do this by different other
parameters, like reducing seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, the combinations are better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can reduce survival and seed
simultaneously, you probably have a better
[SPEAKER_05]: chance of controlling these populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really a rough estimate that I
came to looking at all the different
[SPEAKER_05]: graphs in the different populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roughly, if you could kill 50% of your
plants and reduce seed output by 50%,
[SPEAKER_05]: you might have a good shot at controlling
swallow work populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the projection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the bottom, I didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is sort of in keeping with a
meta-analysis that Ramula et al.
[SPEAKER_05]: had done, looking at multiple species of
invasive plants that had demographic
[SPEAKER_05]: models done for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were specifically looking at the
biocontrol outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they recommended that if you want to
have a successful biocontrol, in this case
[SPEAKER_05]: of long-lived perennial species like the
swallow warts are, you must target
[SPEAKER_05]: survival and growth or survival and
reproduction simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't do that, you're probably not
going to have an effective biocontrol
[SPEAKER_05]: program.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now comes the incorporation of the
actual insects, near to my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being an entomologist, some of you may
have read about this in the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a medium-sized moth called Hypena
opulenta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has a somewhat cryptic caterpillar larval
stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeds on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: This moth was collected in a Ukrainian
forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably will have two generations per
summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Work that was done out of the University
of Rhode Island showed that this moth can
[SPEAKER_05]: only complete its development on European
swallow warts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very host-specific biocontrol
agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for that reason it was,
in fact, released in Canada beginning in
[SPEAKER_05]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still waiting for federal approval
here in the United States, although that
[SPEAKER_05]: might happen this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we may have releases somewhere in the
US this coming summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a second moth that is still
potentially available.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is another defolating moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a larger noctuid moth, so your
typical big brown slow moth, slow fat kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Found across Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually collected from open field to
forest edge habitats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has one generation per year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be maybe less damaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also appears to be host-specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the projected impact of a
defolating insect like these two moths
[SPEAKER_05]: are?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have our six populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got these same contour maps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we collected impact data in a
greenhouse, quarantine greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: for these two moths.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at anywhere from 50 to 100%
defoliation and then what was the response
[SPEAKER_05]: of the plants to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically in terms of seed output and
seedling survival.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that impact is indicated on the
graphs by these shaded boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the left most corner of the box,
that's the maximum damage that these
[SPEAKER_05]: insects were able to cause.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least in our greenhouse studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we want to see is that this
maximum damage occurs to the left of that
[SPEAKER_05]: number one labeled curve in the shrinking
population zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we see when we project population
growth relative to insect damage,
[SPEAKER_05]: we really only have two slower growing
populations that are projected to be
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one forest population and this slow
growing black swallower population.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the remaining populations in field and
forest, all we're going to potentially get
[SPEAKER_05]: is a slow down in population increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the population's still increasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just be increasing at a somewhat
slower rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're still going to be expanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still going to be increasing in density.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with one round of defoliation,
limited effectiveness of these biocontrol
[SPEAKER_05]: agents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hypeena, though, has two generations of
summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we should be able to get two rounds of
defolation and therefore more damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we put that data on these graphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only thing that changes,
we still have these two populations that
[SPEAKER_05]: are projected to be controllable.
[SPEAKER_05]: This population here, which is a highlight
forest infestation of pale swallower,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'd have to get very serious severe
defoliation across the landscape annually
[SPEAKER_05]: if we're projected to control the
swallower at that location.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, for the other sites,
no control is expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one insect left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other insects that have been looked at
have been rejected at this point for not
[SPEAKER_05]: being host specific enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: This fly is in the process of being
screened.
[SPEAKER_05]: The females will lay their eggs in the
developing seed pods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the maggots here will tunnel back
and forth and destroy the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on the literature from Europe,
they can be quite destructive to the seed
[SPEAKER_05]: crop, including eliminating seed from
entire stands of swallower in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that seems hopeful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on that data that we get from the
literature, we can slap that onto these
[SPEAKER_05]: contour maps again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see these same three populations that
are projected to be controllable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now one thing I have to mention is there's
something called population momentum,
[SPEAKER_05]: which due to things like seed bank and
such, you don't necessarily see an
[SPEAKER_05]: immediate cessation of population growth
looking at it with these graphs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So eventually, I think if you were to
consistently destroy seed, there's no more
[SPEAKER_05]: seedling recruitment.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seed banks have been exhausted.
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, the population is going to
stall out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, these are long-lived perennial
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those plants are still going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they may not die off for 10 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fly, at least, might have some
potential as a predispersal seed predator
[SPEAKER_05]: at some locations, at least for immediate
population control.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in summary, might we get control with
these biocontrol agents using this
[SPEAKER_05]: population modeling approach?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, but only for these slower
growing field and forest populations,
[SPEAKER_05]: for the faster growing field and forest
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We project that we're not going to get
control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of that will depend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll just mention, too, if we add a
second round of defolation, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: really change the situation a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this assumes, of course,
that the agent that is released will
[SPEAKER_05]: establish and build up to high population
levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's present but is only at low
densities and therefore causes a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of damage, then it's going to be a
completely ineffective agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fly, by its self, may also have the
same effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it seems like defoliation damage
that these caterpillars cause is sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: comparable to indirect seed loss as
opposed to direct seed loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the end result is sort of a similar
outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one thing that I have sort of
implicitly been talking about is reducing
[SPEAKER_05]: existing stands of swallower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one management goal, sort of your
typical management goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other ways to think about
invasive species control.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have a plant like swallower,
which produces wind dispersed seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have satellite populations that are
being produced, new infestations,
[SPEAKER_05]: because of this dispersal of propagules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are other modeling efforts out
there called kernel dispersal models,
[SPEAKER_05]: which we haven't done any work with,
which have, as a management goal,
[SPEAKER_05]: simply reducing spread of a weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that's a different approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for something like this fly,
maybe if you incorporate this kind of data
[SPEAKER_05]: in this kind of model, maybe that would
show itself to be a very desirable agent
[SPEAKER_05]: to release.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as it currently stands, based on the
work that we've done in the field here and
[SPEAKER_05]: in the population modeling, mechanical
control is, well, not really that good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Herbicidal control is probably still going
to be the tool that people are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: use in open field infestations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biocontrol is going to have limited
utility.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be helpful in forest environments
and some field environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, for a lot of the
infestations, probably the worst
[SPEAKER_05]: infestations of swallower, the high,
light, very productive, produce lots of
[SPEAKER_05]: seed infestations, I think we're still
going to be looking at some combination of
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional control measures, or maybe
integration of some of these biocontrol
[SPEAKER_05]: agents for control of swallower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the work will continue, maybe not as
promising or hopeful as we would like,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that is often the case when you work
with invasives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's time, I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incorporated either density dependence or
I don't know if they're important
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions with other species.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from this photo, not so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: generally, one of the things that has been
noted for swallowers is an alley effect so
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant performance is better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's higher density.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is unclear whether if we have other
stressors like plant competition,
[SPEAKER_05]: if we could shift the balance so that
maybe some of these biocontrol agents will
[SPEAKER_05]: be more effective than we think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although in the forest environment,
we don't have a lot of other plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: not a high density of other species
growing in the forest floor, along with
[SPEAKER_05]: the swallower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if higher densities will
give us better control or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that comes to mind
is when you have a seed-destroying insect,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes its effects are merely
substituting for some other high density
[SPEAKER_05]: effects like seedling thinning,
cell thinning that goes on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes you don't really get a
benefit from a biocontrol agent because
[SPEAKER_05]: all it's doing is replacing some other
ecological process.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would have been really great is to
have a root feeding insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem was they were not
post-specific enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could develop successfully on new
food.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they appear to be quite damaging to
the root mass and destroy a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: root mass, or just cut it off if they seem
to be somewhat messy pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way to combine, like would
there be a time when the biocontrol agents
[SPEAKER_06]: are off the plant that you come in and mow
and so you sort of knock it back with the
[SPEAKER_06]: mowing and you get the biocontrol agent
for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for the moths, that might be
difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one moth, the one that has one
generation, is probably an earlier season
[SPEAKER_05]: moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's because a lot of times in the
native range, these are sort of droughty
[SPEAKER_05]: type habitats.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so by end of summer, the plants have
sort of dried up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a great time for feeding on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plants aren't doing well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if we could add mowing to
that and get any better effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the fly, because it's a later season
insect, it's gonna show up after the
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering has occurred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there can be a combination that
would work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe early season mowing, or maybe even
herbicide application.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the regrowth, potentially you can
allow the flies to clean up the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, the flies aren't gonna be doing
anything in terms of survival of
[SPEAKER_05]: existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think those are the combinations
worth looking into.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll see what the fly's host
range is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in process now so it's too early to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, are there any fungal
agents that have any potential?
[SPEAKER_05]: From overseas work, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't seem to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a fungus, I've talked about this,
some people maybe have heard of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a fungus that was discovered at a
park in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sclerotia maropsida, a well-known
plant, a crap plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is killing the swallow,
which is nothing we've seen elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little early to know whether how
effective it is, or if it's lost,
[SPEAKER_05]: if it might lose virulence over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually some work that's
continuing with Serapethe grid at Vaniva.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna just continue to see what kind
of efficacy this pathogen might have.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely not gonna be a
classical agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something you'd release at the
natural barrier, because it's host range
[SPEAKER_05]: is way too rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it might be something useful,
I'm wondering, in improved pasture
[SPEAKER_05]: settings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this particular pathogen doesn't
seem to typically affect, or at least this
[SPEAKER_05]: strain may not affect grasses or legumes,
which is also some continuing work we have
[SPEAKER_05]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is, within that species,
there's a lot of different strains that
[SPEAKER_05]: have sort of different host ranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully this is a strain that might
have a restricted host range.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still too broad for a classically,
maybe narrow enough for specific use.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it for the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: This remarkable survival, is that because
it doesn't have a cap root, or a large
[SPEAKER_04]: story root, but it's retaining enough
reserves, and then has a kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: bi-essence in the roots that allow it to
hang in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it has a large root mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all the physiology of what
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the fine roots, then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does have fine roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of the big spaghetti, there's sort of
like big spaghetti coming off of the root
[SPEAKER_05]: stock, and then they sort of get a little
smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: The roots can grow quite a distance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I believe Christine tried to dig
some up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They went a meter, at least, and then she
quit trying to dig them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they do spread widely in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can remove the crown, and that
doesn't kill them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there must be some... Well,
it seems like the roots themselves
[SPEAKER_05]: probably don't regenerate plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and that seems to be the
consensus here, is that if you get the
[SPEAKER_05]: root crown out, and you don't have to
worry about getting the rest of the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: out, which is helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't produce rhizomes or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would add that it's certainly one of
the highest root-to-shoot ratios that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in many invasives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for the pale-swallower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not surprised, but it's hanging
in there even after four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: After six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, when homeowners or land managers
tell us to remove twice, it's pretty hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you maybe inhibit seed production,
but they're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for the great presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to follow up on Chuck's comment
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if there's any native
herbivores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's maybe, instead of the
classical biological control approach,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you could use a conservation biological
control approach, where you would increase
[SPEAKER_03]: or inundate the community or the ecosystem
with a native herbivore that would help
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce the population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's very little that feeds on
swallower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly, what I saw, this was based on
surveys several years ago with just a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of generalists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they fed on a lot of species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were never abundant, except for
maybe occasional outbreaks of spider
[SPEAKER_05]: mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: The milkweed feeding insects don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a different chemistry,
a different enough chemistry that they,
[SPEAKER_05]: the monarchs, the caterpillars die.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody I know has been looking at dog
bait beetle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That also doesn't seem to accept swallow
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, we're not seeing
anything else that could be used in,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you said, a conservation way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just not eating it, which probably
is part of the story as to why it's doing
[SPEAKER_06]: so well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer don't eat it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything, they spread it by the
seeds attaching to their eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting it deep into forage.
[SPEAKER_01]: People wonder, how do they get just
transport?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very often, you see it along hunting
trails or the trails of deer, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any last question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if there's information
about what kind of soil about these weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any, you know, maybe confusion
about these weeds prefer all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's been a couple studies,
one that was done in Tony's group and then
[SPEAKER_05]: also one in Canada, at least a couple
papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't seem to show any preference
or better performance in different soil
[SPEAKER_05]: types.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that includes quite a wide range of
soil pH from pH of four up to eight or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there's some differences in
performance, but at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't seem like there's any distinct
preference for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they seem to do well in a lot of
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say related to that was the concern
from folks in the Midwest as the species
[SPEAKER_01]: is moving westward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there particular soil types that they
should be concerned about?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is particularly folks in Michigan,
Wisconsin, and Minnesota, what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the work that we did and others in
Canada show that it's a pretty adaptable
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, maybe there's some finer
adaptation that broadly you can find them
[SPEAKER_01]: across this range, which is kind of what
makes them so problematic, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a quick last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mentioned this at the beginning
of your presentation about when the
[SPEAKER_02]: swallowwort became.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been around for a long time,
but it only recently became invasive,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there people studying what has been
flourished in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm not really sure anybody's
looked at it too historically.
[SPEAKER_05]: One hypothesis is that, well, for other
species of swallowwort in Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: there are known to be differences in their
reproductive strategies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some out-crossing and some
inbreeding population.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black and pale swallow we have here
are completely self-compatible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need any pollinators.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, being milkweed relatives,
they have pollinators, which has to be
[SPEAKER_05]: moved by insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't need insects because they
can just fertilize themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's maybe one idea, is maybe there was
a shift to self-compatibility over those
[SPEAKER_05]: years before they eventually, therefore,
could spread a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: uninhibited.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of other things that
have simultaneously gone on, deer
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure, maybe has opened up things,
because these are one of those unpalatable
[SPEAKER_05]: invasive species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the drowsy and unpalatable
vegetation has just opened up more
[SPEAKER_05]: environments for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's really looked at it
systematically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of points to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not unusual for invasive species to
have a black phase, where they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: below the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are speculating whether it'd be the
right genetics, multiple introductions,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the right genotype to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics of these species are not a
very diverse genetic makeup of these
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all attached with pre-homogeneous,
which is surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have some really good genotype
that's able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the speculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the black phase, the other that's
relevant to our region, and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotally, as smaller farms shut down,
the one thing we've heard from some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers would say, yeah, we used to see
swallow work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just the trampling by cattle and so
forth, they're very brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are very brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They break very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of kept them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a couple of farmers say,
as soon as I sow the animals and revert it
[SPEAKER_01]: back to an old field, these plants from
the edges just kind of came in and
[SPEAKER_01]: exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So land use history, although nobody's
looked at this, I bet you that,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in our region, as these smaller
farms have kind of shut down, some have
[SPEAKER_01]: become larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of old fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be part, because they do hang
around the kind of the ecotome just in the
[SPEAKER_01]: border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of waiting for that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when animals are there, they don't eat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least the trampling just kind of
keeps them up to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're, that's kind of a
few farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's looked at this kind of
historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lag phase, kind of the reproduction is
probably playing a role in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, and people know the
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also the path of what's
that now, just visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have talked enough about this
that people recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you go to organic, it's covered in
pale swallowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now people can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we've passed our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are no other questions,
let's thank William.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
