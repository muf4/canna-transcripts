[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm gonna talk about is our project
to increase the number of students in
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a number of authors on this
and we're gonna see in a slide or two
[SPEAKER_01]: where these folks all fit in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It truly has been a very big project and a
lot of folks have been involved with it as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see here in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did it all get started?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do just a little bit on what got
us to the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really in a lot of ways is like the
perfect movie theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know where these movies where they've
got one set of characters and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of on that and then they bring
in another set of characters and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: third set of characters and you know
eventually all three sets of characters
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna interact but you're not quite
sure when that's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's kind of what was happening
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Meyer was president of the ASHS and
she was very focused on what we call plant
[SPEAKER_01]: blindness which is where people or plants
are all around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we were eating them you know with
the fruit salad but yet people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of them as plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just don't pay attention to the
plants that are all around us and she was
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on that for her presidency for
ASHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the same time Doug Needham and Paul
Redmond at Longwood Gardens had been
[SPEAKER_01]: watching with interest what the Royal
Horticulture Society was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the United Kingdom is probably one of
the areas in the world that is most into
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture okay and yet they were seeing
declines in awareness and interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture there and they got very
concerned about it so they commissioned a
[SPEAKER_01]: study and a project to increase
horticulture called Horticulture Matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Doug and Paul were seeing this,
seeing the success of this and thinking we
[SPEAKER_01]: need something similar here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time as all that myself
and the horticulture administrators we
[SPEAKER_01]: meet annually and one of the years we
actually met here Marvin Pritz hosted the
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting and what became very clear is that
for a number of us we were losing ground
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of students in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so that was one issue but also it was
becoming pretty clear from the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: emails I was getting that industry
government agencies were needing
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so with that we did a real quick
survey and I'm not going to show you all
[SPEAKER_01]: of it but just to hit the main point here
the number of undergraduates in your
[SPEAKER_01]: program has increased greatly or slightly
so around 20% stayed the same around a
[SPEAKER_01]: little over a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the key point there over 40% had
either a slight or a major decrease in the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers of students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is one of those surveys that's
good news and bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news was that yes a lot of
programs were going down but the good news
[SPEAKER_01]: that gave us hope was up here some of the
schools were going up so what were they
[SPEAKER_01]: doing how were they doing it how were they
presenting the programs and as we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of those schools it became clear
that we could this was an issue we could
[SPEAKER_01]: change if we focused on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a group of us came together we were
called the we called ourselves the
[SPEAKER_01]: steering committee for a while three folks
from Longwood Gardens Doug Needham Brian
[SPEAKER_01]: Trader and Marni Conley and then from the
American Society of Horticultural Science
[SPEAKER_01]: myself Mary Meyer Mike Neff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Neff is the executive director of
ASHS and I came in a couple years later as
[SPEAKER_01]: incoming president and president of ASHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all got together and we put together
a white paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically this was our thoughts on what
the issue was and what we thought we
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to do about it and we had three
very big goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one improved public perceptions of
horticulture increased the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture students in two and four year
programs and there was a number of actions
[SPEAKER_01]: we thought we needed to do there and then
ultimately increased increasing the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of well-trained horticultural employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one and the third one these are very
big ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: With our white paper in hand we talked to
other organizations and we found a very
[SPEAKER_01]: receptive audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This first group here these are the
signing partners they agreed to support
[SPEAKER_01]: the initiative in a big way and December
2013 is when we got them lined up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: over 150 others said they were very
supportive and would try to support it in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of financial and otherwise and that
was universities public gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that happened very quickly and it
brought a lot of people together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of organizations had been
concerned about this some hadn't started
[SPEAKER_01]: on working on it others had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay one of our principles right from the
very beginning was not to do complicate
[SPEAKER_01]: what other people were doing but try to
draw it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became clear this was quickly becoming
bigger than the steering committee could
[SPEAKER_01]: handle so we brought in some help and we
put out a call for proposals and Fleishman
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillard and Scholastic put in the winning
bid and they were what they were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do was help us with the research the
marketing and the education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we certainly are all familiar with
research but the social science stuff was
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit outside of our daily work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so that's the introduction on how we
got here so let me show you where we're at
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start first with some of the
organizational things then I'll get to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three entities the National
Leadership Cabinet which is co-chaired by
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna Ball and Paul Redmond from Longwood
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This group is fundraising is a big part of
what they're doing spreading the message
[SPEAKER_01]: to other groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay providing leadership for it and we
have the Advisory Council I'll show you
[SPEAKER_01]: the list here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlie Hall and Sarah Cathcart are the
co-chairs of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This involves a lot of the people from the
various organizations that we had been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay the intent this group is really to
help with the day-to-day matters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative and spreading the word back to
the various organizations and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: great things we did fairly well about a
year and a half ago which just made all
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference in the world is by that
point we had raised enough funds that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to hire an executive director
and Susan Yoder you get a chance to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: her I hope you do she's a force of nature
and she has just been doing a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff she came with a lot of experience
from other associations and has really
[SPEAKER_01]: made this what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right so I'm not going to go through
these names but here's the list of the
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that are on the Leadership Cabinet
and again Anna Ball I think many of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the name Anna Ball and then Paul
Redmond executive director of Longwood
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the Advisory Council now
very long and I know the print is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: small but you can see a lot of a broad
range of associations companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: various organizations and individuals
coming together and this is a very dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next meeting the next organizational
meeting will be here in will be at
[SPEAKER_01]: Longwood in February and when this group
gets together lots of great ideas lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: energies and they really have been getting
a lot done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Financial support one of the things we did
very early on was we went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: universities with with horticulture and
asked them to donate we asked them to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate a very specific amount of money
$4,995 per year for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why $4,995?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most schools $5,000 and up you have to go
through bid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh and a lot of schools did Cornell being
one of them very quickly stepped up and
[SPEAKER_01]: that money was very helpful for two
reasons one is it got it started and two
[SPEAKER_01]: when we went to industry they were very
pleased to see that academics were
[SPEAKER_01]: stepping up to support an issue that
affected academics quite a bit and that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a big effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that several of the companies when
they found out how many universities were
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting it and what they were doing and
they knew they knew how slim most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: university budgets were and not all the
universities were able to provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: close to $5,000 but a number of them were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really made a difference in terms of
getting support from from the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see we got quite a donor list now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so since then we've refined things
and I will say actually Susan Yoder and
[SPEAKER_01]: the crew have refined things into two main
goals change the perception of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture by increasing public
awareness of the positive and diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes of the profession and second
was the increased capacity in horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: through a perception shift that gets
people to view horticulture as a viable
[SPEAKER_01]: career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay all right so what we're looking at is
we want to see a world where everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: understands and values the importance of
plants and the people who work in the art
[SPEAKER_01]: science technology and business of
horticulture where parents always key and
[SPEAKER_01]: educators encourage horticulture as a
career but not shy away from it where
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture is viewed as a vital viable
and diverse career path and where we build
[SPEAKER_01]: a stronger pipeline of talent to bolster
our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so that in a sense is the mission of
Seed Your Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right so now let's get into some of
the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research you know not surprisingly this is
something that involves academia so of
[SPEAKER_01]: course research was going to be at the
core of this and there's three phases of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was internal to the industry
and I will say that each of these phases
[SPEAKER_01]: could very easily be a talk in and of
themselves but I'm going to condense it
[SPEAKER_01]: down quite a bit just going to hit a few
highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right so the first one was internal
the industry the second one was focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the general public and the third
focused on middle school teachers parents
[SPEAKER_01]: educators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so in the first part here the
research consisted of informal interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: literally Fleishman Hillard would convene
groups and talk to people focus groups and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a formal online survey of around 500
respondents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so I'm just going to hit a couple of
the points here why is horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: important and I know I'm speaking to the
choir here so this is should not come as
[SPEAKER_01]: any big surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preserves diversity ensures life you know
all the aspects of horticulture I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had horticulture the food
horticulture in terms of the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture in terms of our of both the
internal and the external environment
[SPEAKER_01]: provides food helps feed the world
enhances life and beauty ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so these were all some of the
responses that we got but Fleishman
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillard did as they summarized and
categorized a lot of the responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the challenges lack of
awareness and understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay we're going to get to one of the key
elements of awareness of horticulture here
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bit but a lot of people just really
don't have a good understanding I think
[SPEAKER_01]: back to when I was an undergraduate and
people would ask me what's my major and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say horticulture either got a blank
look or something like that has something
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with corn right you know that was
about as far as folks got even back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skilled labor shortage just came up a lot
from industry and government in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: shrinking university programs we talked
about that already consolidation of degree
[SPEAKER_01]: programs and then of course lack of
funding on the academic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do we as horticulturists recommend
careers okay why would we encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else to do it and the various
aspects of horticulture I know it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of small print there but rewarding okay
time and time again that's what came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: 28% diversity variety range of careers
available okay I think about my own
[SPEAKER_01]: careers at Zegden's okay ability to work
outside working with nature this will come
[SPEAKER_01]: up a lot nature environment with a lot of
students good for the community helping
[SPEAKER_01]: others impact the world environment impact
is another word that showed up a lot and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to see that at various points
through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the good there's a bad and gosh
what did people oh look low pay 59% all
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest kind of right down there and that
is something we're aware of and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on we think actually the
perception of low pay is probably greater
[SPEAKER_01]: than the low pay actually is with the
exception of graduate students as we so I
[SPEAKER_01]: will start with that following up on
dinner last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so switching gears here gone to phase
two this is the general public asking them
[SPEAKER_01]: about awareness of horticulture and
attitudes having to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: With horticulture okay part of this
research people were given various phrases
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were asked to react to how
strongly they agreed with or disagreed
[SPEAKER_01]: with these phrases now there's a number of
them and for the sake of time I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to show you one here horticulture is
essential to our food water and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment only 34% of 18 to 34 year olds
strongly agreed with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the surface okay that's a third that's
not bad but think about what that's saying
[SPEAKER_01]: food only a third of folks thought that
horticulture was essential for food okay
[SPEAKER_01]: and you think about what you eat in a
normal day you know the row crops agronomy
[SPEAKER_01]: provides the bulk of our calories but
really it's the horticulture that provides
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the taste it provides a lot of
the phytonutrients okay and how critical
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture is to what we eat and yet
only about a third made that connection so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why that was pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Familiarity with horticulture in general
and this is very broadly defined and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be important for later it
tended to be a little bit more better with
[SPEAKER_01]: older folks 35 years and older a little
higher with Caucasians wealthier they were
[SPEAKER_01]: more aware of horticulture college degree
more aware of horticulture although not
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly significant the younger the
less likely people were to be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture and again the researchers in
this case were taking a very broad
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of horticulture if they
mentioned just anything in that could
[SPEAKER_01]: remotely be connected they counted it as
aware okay but when we flip it around when
[SPEAKER_01]: you tell people what is involved with
horticulture they get very very positive
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact I'm going to step back just a
little bit when we were interviewing firms
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the marketing and the research
Fleishman-Hillard had done a quick survey
[SPEAKER_01]: to get ready for their presentation and
they said they at that time had not worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with an issue or the basics were so
positive okay because some of these firms
[SPEAKER_01]: work with you know companies that are
trying to resurrect their image or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know professionals that are trying to
raise their their image they said no this
[SPEAKER_01]: one they were excited about this one
because the basics were there everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: likes horticulture they just don't know
it's horticulture okay now getting to the
[SPEAKER_01]: phase three part here consisted of online
surveys part of this was two reasons one
[SPEAKER_01]: is to get information and two was to get
an idea of what the the population's view
[SPEAKER_01]: of horticulture was the next phase is
going to be trying to change that and so
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to change something and you
want to assess it you want to have numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: to compare it with so the idea was to find
out what are the baseline so as we go
[SPEAKER_01]: forward hopefully will affect the change
compare it seventh eighth and ninth
[SPEAKER_01]: graders at that thousand a thousand
parents 500 teachers and 200 guidance
[SPEAKER_01]: counselors that's the number of people
that participated in the online surveys
[SPEAKER_01]: okay the slide deck that they sent us for
this part was over 80 slides so I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pick a couple all right um
remember this is seventh eighth and ninth
[SPEAKER_01]: graders already almost a third want to get
a bachelor's degree in a quarter of them a
[SPEAKER_01]: master's or a PhD now I don't know about
you but when I was a ninth grader I had
[SPEAKER_01]: not a clue I mean I was still I'm not even
sure I was thinking about going to college
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time we had a quarter of students
are already thinking that they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a master's or a doctorate so they're
already thinking about stuff and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair number ready thinking about
associates degree so we got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: students that are ready thinking about
what's next after high school okay so what
[SPEAKER_01]: they did was they asked these students
parents educators counselors about a broad
[SPEAKER_01]: range of careers we've got education
psychology nursing biology communications
[SPEAKER_01]: accounting agriculture and then the nice
short little bar here is horticulture okay
[SPEAKER_01]: even less than agriculture so it shows
that people really are not aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture as a career as a degree
program now this graph takes a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of explaining okay so this on this axis
here is the percentage and then here are
[SPEAKER_01]: very various attributes so we have impact
creativity flexibility passion location of
[SPEAKER_01]: job status compensation job availability
the blue bar is what folks thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of horticulture so they're given
a general idea of what horticulture is and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they're asked to react to that okay
the red line is what this is students the
[SPEAKER_01]: red line is what students want in their
career the difference the gap between the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue and the red is an issue we have to
work with other careers don't show this
[SPEAKER_01]: gap okay other careers the awareness of
the career is much closer to what students
[SPEAKER_01]: want out of a career so the difference
here in particular passion I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: very passionate horticulturists trust me
but yet the general public doesn't view
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture as being a career one would
get passionate about and a lot of students
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted a career that they could really get
passionate about so you see the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: there that percentage is what we have to
work on okay and it was very clear there
[SPEAKER_01]: was some cases where this line went below
but it was on characteristics that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of students didn't think were that
important so we've got to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease that gap okay the next part of
the pastry research was focus groups
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing people in and talking with them
the six of these were in urban areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were conducted in person another six
were in rural areas and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: conducted online with cameras and it's
very cool how this stuff happens okay what
[SPEAKER_01]: became clear from the focus groups is that
students really want to do something that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're passionate about okay passion has
come up multiple times they want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: creative and they want to see impact from
their work and they want to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes a positive impact on the world
it was really fascinating because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: again I think back to when I was younger
how really advanced in some ways young
[SPEAKER_01]: people are today in terms of seeing the
world and where they fit into that and
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to have an impact even at that
young age okay they want to use words well
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to use words that resonate with
you the participants liked sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: sounding names you know and let me talk a
little bit about awareness of horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: here okay so in these focus groups what
percentage of people do you think were
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of horticulture or knew what
horticulture was okay what percentage so
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a class question here 15% okay
very good other suggestions 30 a very
[SPEAKER_01]: positive person very good other
suggestions unfortunately it was zero this
[SPEAKER_01]: is where they were being asked the word
and they were not being given anything
[SPEAKER_01]: leading up to it yeah zero well and
parents and teachers now it's a small
[SPEAKER_01]: group because it's focus groups zero not a
one in this particular group now we had
[SPEAKER_01]: some awareness earlier but a lot of that
was where they were people were led into
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know the components of horticulture
then they were able to put it together so
[SPEAKER_01]: zero in all of our you know we've had
conference calls regularly or the steering
[SPEAKER_01]: committee and then later on and that's a
question we often came back to was what do
[SPEAKER_01]: we do with the word horticulture because
it is clear that the general public does
[SPEAKER_01]: not know what horticulture is but if you
try to think about what one word
[SPEAKER_01]: encompasses all that horticulture is yeah
that's a tough that's a tough question so
[SPEAKER_01]: we finally just had to stop talking about
it because we kept going down that rabbit
[SPEAKER_01]: hole and this really these focus groups
really clearly showed that we have an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue so one of the fun things they did in
these focus groups is they asked all right
[SPEAKER_01]: so if not horticulture what else and
different categories came up plant science
[SPEAKER_01]: of course we know that's already being
used plantology now the academic in me
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first saw that was just like oh
made a tough word you know but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: since grown to actually kind of like that
one land arts plant mastery vine arts I
[SPEAKER_01]: suspect there were some adults here having
to do with wine the the corresponding
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture is plant scientists
plantologists food and flowers specialists
[SPEAKER_01]: land artists and plant master okay so one
of the things we've Susan has done in
[SPEAKER_01]: workshops is to ask people to take a
moment to think about what they would call
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves so think about that what would
you Amanda here was calling herself plant
[SPEAKER_01]: master what would you call yourself to
somebody who has no idea what horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: is and is not an academia so we don't
really care think about that all right
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so just to summarize real quick
finish up here students want a career that
[SPEAKER_01]: offers more than a paycheck they want to
be creative and they want to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact okay again creativity impact so
what do we have to do we have to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: favorable perception of horticulture and
the careers associated with it okay
[SPEAKER_01]: parents those who were familiar with
horticulture had a very narrow view of
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was what I mean by that is
somebody might have some awareness of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture but they might think it only
had to do with being a landscaper or only
[SPEAKER_01]: had to do with being a gardener or a
vegetable gardener very few had any
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness of the breath of horticulture
from the you know just think about in the
[SPEAKER_01]: university here we've got applied science
the very basic science all the various
[SPEAKER_01]: careers that our students go into you know
most people just do not have awareness of
[SPEAKER_01]: that talking about the variety of jobs
when parents are looking into information
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to help their children out with
careers they cast a very broad net the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet educators counselors they draw in
all the information that they can to help
[SPEAKER_01]: their their children one of the things
we've got from this is we need a very
[SPEAKER_01]: robust digital presence because a lot of
time by parents is spent online
[SPEAKER_01]: researching various careers and offering
suggestions to their to their children so
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a lot of work to do here and we
have already started on some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers the summary while some have heard
of horticulture no one encountered a
[SPEAKER_01]: student who was actually interested in
horticulture now again we're going back to
[SPEAKER_01]: this fairly narrow group the focus groups
but still that's that's an issue however
[SPEAKER_01]: once they learned about it and as I
mentioned before they became very positive
[SPEAKER_01]: about it again horticulture in and of
itself is something that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: like once they learn about it and they
came up with a lot of connections that
[SPEAKER_01]: they could see between the the more
general public sort of activities and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture nature in the outdoors food
and cooking health nutrition science of
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation environmentalism all of
this can be connected to horticulture and
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers want less than plans and
activities to help integrate plants into
[SPEAKER_01]: their curriculum okay and that's one of
the things we're working on we know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of information already out
there ffa for example 4h has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: great curriculum so what the intent is to
be for senior future would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: clearinghouse for that information and
then look for the gaps and what might not
[SPEAKER_01]: be there we might have to fill in but at
least not recreate the wheel oops so
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance counselors in middle school
guidance counselors are actually doing
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively little in terms of career
they're doing a lot of the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: counseling they're the metrics this sort
of thing they're managing the day-to-day
[SPEAKER_01]: issues so middle school counselors you've
decided are not going to be a primary
[SPEAKER_01]: focus okay but I will say high school
counselors they tend to rely a lot on what
[SPEAKER_01]: they get from universities which is very
nice this came up in some of the earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: work and I should have mentioned back
earlier in as we were getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: information it became clear that we needed
to change our focus just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: going into this the steering committee we
thought that we were going to need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on high school okay what we
realized through the research is that by
[SPEAKER_01]: the time students are in high school the
general path is set the individual career
[SPEAKER_01]: is not now I'm mean I deal with a lot of
of incoming freshmen and some of them have
[SPEAKER_01]: a very good idea what they're going to do
and some don't but almost always they have
[SPEAKER_01]: a direction figured out okay what we
realized is that we needed to help change
[SPEAKER_01]: the direction towards plants and
horticulture and that was going to need to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen earlier so somebody in high school
you know they they might you know they
[SPEAKER_01]: might be narrowing it down to plants
environment biology lawyer doctor this
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of thing so we decided we needed to
go earlier to start getting people
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in plants in general to help
set the direction and then the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: career will come later and luckily as I
mentioned by the time counselors are in
[SPEAKER_01]: high school they actually rely a lot on
universities we have a lot of cache to
[SPEAKER_01]: them because think about it all the
information that's on the internet you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to rely on information from you
universities okay so overall campaign we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use words that resonate we have
really learned that words make a big deal
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to describe horticulture in terms
of of impact food environmentalist you
[SPEAKER_01]: know environmentalism making those
connections we need to talk about how
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture affects that we need to
stress the diversity of jobs highlight job
[SPEAKER_01]: availability tell the right stories with
the right imagery and give the tools to
[SPEAKER_01]: the teachers that just sounds so simple
doesn't we just got to do that and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything will be better there's a lot
involved with that what's really nice is I
[SPEAKER_01]: can speak as a former department head when
we started to go down the path of what to
[SPEAKER_01]: do try to recruit more students into
horticulture at NC State and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: such a broad field and you get half a
dozen people together and all the great
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas people came up with we were quickly
overwhelmed what the research has done has
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed us to focus we know that for high
school guidance counselors for example
[SPEAKER_01]: they want stuff they want pieces short
one-page pieces they can hand to their
[SPEAKER_01]: students they can keep a stack on the desk
and just very quickly not so much videos
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much some of the other things so
we've been able to target what we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do for which group like I said early on I
was just we were getting overwhelmed as to
[SPEAKER_01]: what we what we could do so how are we
going to make this happen the next step is
[SPEAKER_01]: an education plan with tools curricula web
resources partnerships of course and an
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy and marketing plan to get all
this information out and that is that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: progress and there's some of the imagery
right there that's moving forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be the next stage so with
that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a video we put together
[SPEAKER_04]: is more than you say because of my
feelings or more than I can let by or not
[SPEAKER_04]: more than you can just model the day
[SPEAKER_04]: you Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Comments?
Yes.
For the video you showed at the very end,
is that finalized, or are you going to add
[SPEAKER_07]: more materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, yeah, it's final for this phase
of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next phase of the project is really
focusing on very specific videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think they've got one done
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interviewing folks, why they got into
horticulture, and what their path was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point it's going to get more
specific, and it's going to be specific
[SPEAKER_01]: videos to help do certain parts of the
campaign.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's clearly a branding issue with
the name horticulture, but there's not an
issue with the lack of teaching plant
biology or botany in middle school and
high school.
Right, my son's going through this.
He gets a lot of education in these
issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's doing full-blown synthesis right now,
and cellular respiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like the target while building
some lesson plans and activities is great,
but getting into textbooks, the name
horticulture, and defining that in the
textbooks is probably difficult to do and
expensive, but it seems like that's where
teachers, that's where students are going
to get it, and that's what teachers are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to teach out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of the curriculum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things are going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can use horticulture crops,
if they can use horticulture plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and make that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is part of what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it plant biology, or they call
it botany, and it might be some
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture, but you don't see
horticulture per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we need to make that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_08]: John, can you ask Geneva if Geneva has any
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, John, Thomas Jorkman here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to characteristically jump to
the one problem that you showed so
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we report on the starting salaries of
graduates in various majors here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and horticulture usually looks terrible in
part because a lot of students will go to
[SPEAKER_02]: a seasonal job or an internship or
something as their first job, and so the
[SPEAKER_02]: median ends up being rather low as a
result, and that's kind of what people
[SPEAKER_02]: see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's obviously bad advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have examples that you can use of
the more remunerative jobs a horticulture
[SPEAKER_02]: graduate might get straight out of school?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question, and we are
aware of that, and we think that once a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of this gets lost, that one of the
things we're going to need to do is to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get a much better idea of salaries,
and I'm afraid I need to rely a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: on my horticulture background.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the magazines for many years
released a survey, and it broke out the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse industry by manager,
grower, pest control, and that really did
[SPEAKER_01]: a very good job of splitting out the
various job types and the salaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the salaries in those cases looked
pretty good, especially for the manager in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those other categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing is partly what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the blending together of entry-level
jobs along with professors and that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing, and business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you blend it all together,
the large number of low numbers from folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that are making minimum wages on a
landscaper, working on a landscape crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: really brings down the overall average so
I think what we need to do there is for
[SPEAKER_01]: each of the industry is really pull out
the job categories and separate out
[SPEAKER_01]: entry-level, which is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will freely admit that, but it's low for
most careers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entry-level tends to be very low,
and separate that out from the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher-level jobs, and those are the jobs
really that we are training our students
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we know that a lot of you,
I mean I mowed lawns when I was young,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not what I went to college for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to college to train for other kinds
of jobs, including one right here in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to do a much better job of
separating that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, other than in a few narrow
instances, we don't have that data right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first went to school, I got a
two-year associate degree in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were not from a farm,
you had to do some work experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder if there's a way to get
people some practical experience in
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture to make that kind of a,
you know, get some experience under
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves before they leave the college
for the degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing that a lot at NC State.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Horticulture Department at NC State
now requires an internship, a student to
[SPEAKER_01]: have an internship before they go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a broader scale, we've done a lot
of survey work at the College of Ag level,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at what components of a resume
does industry want or look for the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the highest scoring is
internships.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shows up a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do know that internships are
important, that is something that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying at NC State to make it easier for
students to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it also came up in the Seed Your
Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the phase one, one of the other
questions, which I didn't show,
[SPEAKER_01]: was we asked industry, what do you think
you could do to help increase awareness of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they suggested internships as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think on both ends of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: John, on that one graph you showed,
in addition to the gap, there also was a
[SPEAKER_08]: real passion gap, which surprised me
because most horticulturists I know are
[SPEAKER_08]: passionate about horticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would seem to be an area to really
emphasize in future videos and educational
[SPEAKER_08]: efforts to really bring out the passion
that people feel about horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the ones that surprised
us the most because we do know so many
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that are just so into what they do,
but yet that didn't come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people not aware of
horticulture just don't know that we
[SPEAKER_01]: really like what we do and we're into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we've got to work on that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems like there's this pipeline
where you're looking at undergraduate
[SPEAKER_05]: enrollment and you're talking about NC
State, much of your board are professors,
[SPEAKER_05]: academics.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the thought about people who work
in horticulture but might not necessarily
[SPEAKER_05]: need an undergraduate degree?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys working to facilitate any
kind of apprenticeship programs or some
[SPEAKER_05]: other high school?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been in land-grant
universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe very strongly in what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody needs a four-year degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks are a two-year degree is
enough, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some not even a two-year degree is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we speak a lot about a pipeline,
but we probably need more of a tree
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy with the idea that people come in
at various points and go out of it at the
[SPEAKER_01]: point that best suits them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have to say, yeah, I agree
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm very pro-university,
but some of the students I work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you sit and talk with them,
it's like, you really don't need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell my dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, in terms of apprenticeships,
I'm not sure that we're specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be a useful thing,
I think, especially early on, like in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school, where we might be able to get
folks interested in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a secure industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's not getting outsourced to
India.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our jobs are staying here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comment being it's a secure industry,
yes, I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts of it might get robots, but that's
mostly going to be the entry level,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the higher up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have like Driscoll strawberries all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Driscolls are everywhere,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
