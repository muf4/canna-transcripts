[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'll talk about roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention one thing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a talk like two or three months ago
at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the talk today will be new,
but some of it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who are coming back will have to
suffer or enjoy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is, so I called it towards the
second revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, what is, the first
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first green revolution is
attributed to Professor Borlaug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's considered this huge increase in
crop yields, mainly grain yields that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen due to use of pesticides and new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these yields got to a plateau in the
last few years with this yield in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are not going up to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think because we are root people,
but also trying to be objectively that the
[SPEAKER_00]: next revolution and increasing the yield
should come from the roots since the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is towards the second green
revolution where until let's say five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, much less studied than the
above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a 5% of publications were on
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do roots do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots have many functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have anchorage, water and nutrient
uptake, storage, biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: asexual reproduction and communication
with other plants and with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will now, I'll present to you several
studies that were carried out in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These studies are dealing with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show you how I got excited
into roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start with the first project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first project is the role of root
orders in water and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the question is, what are root
orders?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to understand that, it will be
easy to first understand what are reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: stream orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about rivers,
it's easy to think that the small creek
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to a bigger creek, to a bigger creek
and then to the large creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we say in a poem in Hebrew,
all rivers at the end go to the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the main river that goes to the
sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the small river is order one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the order that gets orders one is
order two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in order that gets an order two,
you're in order three, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plants, it's more or less the same,
but it's below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to the sea,
but we're going to the tree instead of the
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in roots, until also today,
most research is usually based on
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have large roots and small roots,
fine roots, coarse roots, different people
[SPEAKER_00]: with different, and the size is important
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this term of root orders came up in
the literature already a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not much research was done about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested to know what is the
function, whether there is a function for
[SPEAKER_00]: this specific root order and what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, you need students or
post-docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a very good post-doc in my
life, Boris Revald, Dr. Boris Revald,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is now a PI at the Boku University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to work on trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to work on orange trees,
just what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew them hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see they're growing hydroponically
in a nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decided to look at the root
orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we constructed these chambers,
mini chambers, see here, where they hold
[SPEAKER_00]: with them a piece of a root order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be root order one, two, three,
different root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this chamber, we connected to a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant here, this is the orange tree
growing in a nutrient solution with our
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber is connected to a scale with a
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if this area is taking water up,
so what will happen to the weight in the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale is connected to a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by this, we could know exactly the
rate of uptake of every specific root
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hard thing to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are measuring the uptake of
different root orders just by connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: them to a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have root orders one, one, two,
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is under nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a little bit decrease of uptake
when we have nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is versus distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was interesting, but also
expected, is that root orders one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smallest root orders, are uptaking
much more water, nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the really surprising thing,
and the thing that we had to repeat and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat in order to make sure we understand
what's happening, is when we went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: four and five root orders, the large
roots, we saw water coming into the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weight is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was happening, and we did it again and
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an influx in root order one,
two, three, and an influx, water coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out from the high root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the question was whether this is
active or passive going out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you soon what we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for sure, we have water coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you now already what we
think, is the large root orders are the
[SPEAKER_00]: main shadow for the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're usually older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to maintain a relatively wet
environment for them not to die,
[SPEAKER_00]: these root orders have both passive and
active exits of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people talk about hydraulic lift in
other papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of hydraulic lift,
but this is in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to remember this is in
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this root order is going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was, I did it by area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when we calculate it by weight,
so no matter what we calculate,
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece of root is there, is by area
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still see this influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water coming out of the high root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we said, OK, let's see what happens
under salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just when we grow them under salinity,
you look here, these different root
[SPEAKER_00]: orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main effect is to the root order
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are significantly decreased,
the small root orders under salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, root order three is decreased
significantly, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when we decrease this root
order once?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis, if we decrease them,
will decrease the uptake of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see here, that this was under
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we grow them under salinity,
you see rates decreased by at least 50%,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also saw that the influx that we
showed doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no water coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows us that the part of the
efflux from high orders is also active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not also only a passive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then we say, OK, this is under
salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's give these plants, release them
for stress for two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Release them from salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is we see this very large
increase of uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are under salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we give them an option where
there's no salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, this is under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efflux from high root orders under
salinity, very low uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at release, you have a very large
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the rate of uptake to J.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our first project that I wanted
to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the statistics,
we see that in these root orders,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you say root order one or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most statistical thing is the
order itself, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the distance, not where it is in the
branch, not if it's up or down,
[SPEAKER_00]: not if it's the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most significant is the root order
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are continuing to deal with
these root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just I'm showing you examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work on papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow the plants on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the roots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by this, we could just punch the paper
with time and see uptake of nutrients next
[SPEAKER_00]: to different root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not published yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is work that we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the different root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example for potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is time and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a different uptake behavior of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only they're taking water
differently or solution, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically taking different nutrients
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that also, we look also
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the root respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, the root one and two,
they are more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respire significantly more than the
higher root orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: So water uptake rates were determined by
the root order and not by diameter or
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water uptake rates under salinity
decreased significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in plants grown in salinity and
subjected locally to a non-salt solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: all orders showed only influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first project I wanted to
tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root-root interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you roots have many roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the interaction with the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a root system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this root system, we have different
roots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this root know that this root is
the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this hand know that this belongs to
the same individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when we know it was
already published that when you have two
[SPEAKER_00]: roots together, so for some reason,
this root knows they are decreasing their
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look at this root-root
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we used peas as a model
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll just show you in order to
understand the terminology is this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of one individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are called self.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the roots of the other individuals
are also called self in between them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple color versus the red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this red sees this purple,
it's non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have self and non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We took our peas and we split the roots
when they are young into two platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each, we have three ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each port, we have one plant with its
own roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, we have three ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each port, we have roots from two
different individuals because we take the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual and split it into two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the roots here, half here,
half here, half here, half here,
[SPEAKER_00]: half here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all parts here are non-self,
and all parts here are self.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing to do is this is a
cascam of a non-self root, you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you take an x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to Vienna and talk about it,
this is what it reminds you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't get it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the inspiration for Ithaca for
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get in the next talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is self and non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measure root length in the
non-self is significantly decreased versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is also significantly
decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next thing we wanted to see is
what happens to respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration is a very important process in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's much less studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no people in the world who
measure intact respiration of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as you can see, a large fraction
of the assimilates can be expended by
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration up to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does respiration produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP, NADPH, or NADH?
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my lab, we developed this not very
nice looking, but very effective way to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure root respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured simultaneously both O2 and
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these special chambers with
Teflon because the O2 is very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put our plants, we seal them,
and we measure going gas in and out,
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly, for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this very weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-self plants had 30% more respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm next to a neighbor, I'm going,
I'm nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots, when they are from the same
plant, for some reason, they know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm far, I'm going, what does
increased respiration give us?
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes on the expense of carbon
going to growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, you can see, this is both as a
CO2 release and O2 consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is by time, this is just day,
night and day of the non-self and self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots that are respiring more just
because they're seeing their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: So root length, an area decreased when you
have non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root respiration increased when you have
non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens under stress conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most important stresses
that we work in the lab is salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote that we put 100 millimolar NaCl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that when you are self,
you are much more affected than when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing also happens in the
shoot and also in respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So respiration under salinity increases,
but in both self and non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it increases less in the non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if we are ready for the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are already respiring too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we're more acclimated to our
non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our future stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So non-self plants were less affected by
salt stress than self plants, indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: on a possible acclimation to future stress
in non-self plants in a feed forward
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our results provide new information on
root restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you could read the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the horticultural meeting,
I heard a little bit about aeroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided just to show that we also do
aeroponics in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we wanted to do it, we wanted to
control temperature, because we are very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in extreme temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing we thought about is like the
ice cream refrigerators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we built these ice cream refrigerators,
and we could control the root temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very stable root temperature for 40
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these chillers at the end of
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a nutrient solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands on a weight, so we know
exactly how much water we are giving all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a chamber with four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are growing in the air,
and we spray them every minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: With nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the plants are growing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at hydroponics, soil,
and aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing the biggest one in the
aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots are more similar to soil
than hydroponics in their architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very good tool to study the
roots, aeroponics system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy access to the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depositions on the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have adequate area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of mechanical impedance when we want
to take the roots so we're not destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the root development is similar to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages are that if you grow,
if you live in the desert very far,
[SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes we do have no electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten minutes without electricity in the
desert, the plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's no buffer to hold the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you do when you have a
student, you make sure he has a smartphone
[SPEAKER_00]: and he gets these SMSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first day it happened,
he got 200 SMSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now it's only one per day or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to run fast to see the plants
and make sure they're OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of them are false SMSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have very, you need this technical
know-how that we supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just show you an example for a
research that was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a grafted bell peppers taken
from the company Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in collaboration with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were looking at, we were very
interested in roots and different root
[SPEAKER_00]: sirens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we grafted Canon and Canon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we grafted Canon and S103.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the effect of low
temperatures on the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the plants and we grow
them either under 14 degrees or just one
[SPEAKER_00]: week for 14 degrees and then recovery or
27 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at the above ground,
you almost don't see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the roots,
and it's easy to look at the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see significant differences between
the 103 is much more tolerant in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: wise than the Canon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could go deeper to the roots and
look at root, the projected area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and number of tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a significant decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't see anything above ground in
the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do see lots below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at all the metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotypically, we didn't see anything
in the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at metabolites in the
shoots, we see large differences from
[SPEAKER_00]: control when they are under 14 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are less differences in the 103
when the root is 103.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was just an example of aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did publish not all of it,
but some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, almost last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interested in wine vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also got interested in it like six
or seven years ago already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started growing Cabernet Sauvignon
and Shiraz in our desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why grow wine vine in the desert?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have lots of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature extremes are good for the
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of water is the big advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: When wine vines are stressed, they produce
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this way, when we irrigate them,
we could control exactly how much water to
[SPEAKER_00]: give.
[SPEAKER_00]: No surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No have rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our area, here we have like 80
millimeters a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only between December to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 millimeters is 8 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2 and 1 half inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go a little more south,
it's less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also making our own wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not the first ones to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nabataeans, 3,000 years ago,
had these wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is of that 10 minutes from our
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is shift at 25 minutes from our
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these are wine presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had large winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means there was many wine vines
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wine was exported.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two cities are 3,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sitting under what is called
incense route from Yemen to the port of
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaza and then to Cyprus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you found in Cyprus these clay bottles
of wine with the stamp of duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2,500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wine was in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now being reintroduced to the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the wine vines in our area are
grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are all grafted on one rootstock
Roger, which is the tolerant rootstock for
[SPEAKER_00]: our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rootstocks of all our Cabernet
Sauvignon, Chiraz, whatever we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew this Cabernet Sauvignon in
Chiraz, the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background is the same, Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see in black is Chiraz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiraz is taking much more water than
Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is becoming much drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every four days we irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every four days, the water comes to the
same in both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the four days, Chiraz and Cabernet
Sauvignon slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same rootstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the season,
we even stopped irrigating completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil in Cabernet Sauvignon does not
go down to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something differently
hydraulically between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We repeat an experiment in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that again, Chiraz is taking
much more water than Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an experiment where we stop
irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that Chiraz is taking much more
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at the water potential,
so under non-stress conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under stress conditions, they both go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Cabernet Sauvignon stabilizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiraz continues to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these terms for that, I won't go into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they behave hydraulically differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this hydraulic behavior, the different
hydraulic behavior, leads also to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different photochemical behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthesis, electron transport
rate, in the Cabernet Sauvignon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which takes less water, is always higher
than in Chiraz.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if soon maybe I'll close tomato,
I need to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, all the time open, I'm less
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydraulic and photochemical behaviors
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think we understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the wine itself, when we look at
the wine, so this is all the metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Chiraz, and this is, in this case,
is the berry itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look also at the skin and the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chiraz is much more sensitive to this
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, many metabolites are changing all
the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Cabernet Sauvignon, it's much more
moderate, the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are interested in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is, we have this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put this mineralized one tube to
two meters deep and looked at roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure every 12 millimeters up to the
depth of two meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it even more like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we dug the two meters, we put them
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put them in two distances,
25 centimeters and 75 centimeters from the
[SPEAKER_00]: trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a knowledge of the root system
going like this and going like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get the impression of a 3D what's
happening below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're also measuring two distances
and also down to the depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see how the root dynamics,
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was quite amazing for us,
is first of all, is how deep these roots
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is drip irrigation,
you have to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think we'll get over half a
meter or a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to two meters easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in Cabernet Sauvignon and
Chiraz, where they are close to the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see roots in both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we go further from the trunk,
you see no roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Chiraz, only in Cabernet
Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chiraz is growing like this,
Cabernet Sauvignon is growing like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the same root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rogerie, the root system, is reacting
to its above ground, to the different
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is going like this, Chiraz,
one is going like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same root system, Rogerie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we count the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 25 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 75 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the red is Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue is Chiraz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chiraz behaved in a near anisoidic way,
whereas Cabernet Sauvignon in a near
[SPEAKER_00]: isoidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this behavior was correlated to high
water transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show all the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also accompanied by
photochemical efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And root distribution in the dynamics
changed according to the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think if we have wine vine
irrigation, it should take into account
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar specific water behavior,
although nobody does it until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So solar anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the plant I was most interested
when I got to this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a summer annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is a very small plant with
very shallow roots, 15 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual plant that grows only in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it germinates around March,
April, stays small until June,
[SPEAKER_00]: then starts to grow, gets to its maximum
October, November flowers and dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No rain between March and November,
no rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an amazing plant and I was
interested in it because I was looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I thought about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't talk to you about it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to you only about what's
happening below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came to this plant, I came and I dug
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I dug it, I saw this thing at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning I crushed it and I get
something mushy in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought what it is and we have these mud
huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a pizza hut, it's a mud hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have many mud huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant could have one mud hut,
some of them three, two, many mud huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go inside and instead of crushing it,
like I did the first time, I open it
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly and I see a weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 60,000 weevils in the world,
60,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: No weevils are known to live with plants
without harming them below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when you talk to farmers,
about weevils, they're all scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Israel, the palm tree industry is a
very important industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The date tree, it's called also the
quarter tree because each date is sold for
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very afraid of weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing their trees, the weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our weevils, not only they're not
killing them, as I'll show you,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're living together and you'll see the
root is not harmed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see larva, we see pupa, we see
weevils, we see all these terms that I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned to know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm becoming like an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eggs, we also see, I'll show you eggs
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they're very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the main weevil we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conorhynchus, so it's nice and cool
pictures to show people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could sit inside, I'll show you
there, half a year and then after I could
[SPEAKER_00]: open it and then they go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a very good student, Owen
Shaleff, and he did a lot of observations
[SPEAKER_00]: and working and we made this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're out, the weevils are out like
two months from the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a larva here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a small plant has a small larva,
a big plant has a big larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adult plant flowering has an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in blue is the rainfall and
these are the temperatures, average
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also, so they grow together,
the weevil and the plant, small together,
[SPEAKER_00]: big together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decided to analyze roots
because that's what we do in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: we analyze roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our very big surprise, roots with
weevils had 30% more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 14% less carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were showing at the beginning that,
this is our conclusion from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the roots are getting nitrogen from
the weevils and giving sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, to the weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, seeds of the plants with
weevils were bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what, now, today was just the
second paper in this story was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's online today already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed, I'm not the PI because this
paper was rejected from Nature and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: left it for three years and then I gave it
to another collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants are also bigger when you
have weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not sure if the weevils are going
to big plants or they're helping them to
[SPEAKER_00]: go bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what is the egg and what is
the hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to know what is the egg or the
hen, you send them by mail and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the, we made measurements
from different areas from the mud hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is very close to the mud hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most significant one, they're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we said, okay, where's the
nitrogen coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This root has more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at the weevils in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw DNA of nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a three-way symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bacteria living nicely,
enjoying its life in the weevil,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the weevil in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody are profiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw the DNA in also the adults and
for two years we couldn't see nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only saw it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us two years to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larva has nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All have the genes for this clabsiella
nitrogen, NIF genes that take nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very limiting factor in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen and water, these are the limiting
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to reminder, we saw a small plant,
small larva, big plant, big larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to show that sugar is going
from the plant to the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we took our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was small, we knew it was a small
larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the French Revolution to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped the factory of sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: We created the factory for midgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the small larvae pupated and became
midgets or died.
[SPEAKER_00]: When sugar stops to come, they become
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this three way and this is an
amazing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are continuing to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dr. Michal Segoli, who is a new
researcher in our institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just more or less gave her the
project and she's doing wonderful things
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a very large survey,
like 16 different places in our desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every place we go, we find this larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the sites we checked and the
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some areas, the plants get up to almost
50, over 50% of the plants have larva,
[SPEAKER_00]: some only 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started, we found, we looked at
this area and we had only 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the thing that people
didn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see it's everywhere and it's
correlated to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have more nitrogen in the
soil, you have more weevils and also
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is correlated positively with
nitrogen, but correlated negatively with
[SPEAKER_00]: sand and positively with silk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So texture and nitrogen are correlated
with these weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when the plant dies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If rain comes, the weevil says,
OK, I'll go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, I'm not very fast,
but I'm a weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going there slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying hi to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philadelphia one or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when you have a larva,
a small plant, we have a larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we open this larva and look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it go out like it's adult?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still not very developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's slow in thinking, but then it gets
to a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks, thinks, thinks to go out or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will stay inside and I'll build my house
and get some sugars and maybe water from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, give it some nitrogen,
live together with my bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you have post-docs working and
this new PI, so you have these cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was taken with a cell phone in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted our plant and we put larva in
order to have some weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you we didn't see eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's digging, you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's digging a hole in order to get to
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see when the hole is good
enough, soon, soon we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So takes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see it's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm turning.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a, see here, the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg is coming, but I have to sit down
and relax in order for it to come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm relaxing and this will take another
minute for this relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, the weevils could be,
yeah, from over two centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: from two and a half to three centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to small, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, some are small, some are big,
depending on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: When?
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put them only with the plant,
this is some of the problems we
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they could kill this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually they don't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they have other, now in the summer,
this is the only annual there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they eat perennials.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larva doesn't harm the root.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see here, here, here it's finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pushed and I'm going, I'm doing very
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we continue, we'll see how at
the end the hole is covered and the egg is
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an amazing story, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because of all these root things,
we have developed what we call Root of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter, which I'm directing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sponsored for $7 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are just the base money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are collaborating with, we have 20 PIs
in our Root of the Matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are collaborating with different
companies that only add some more funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, Root of the Matter, you see a
dentist and another dentist, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have three projects within our
Root of the Matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Graphing, which I'm a part of it,
and I'm also managing the grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to graft vegetables of
tomatoes and melons in order to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: their abiotic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at root, all kinds of root
characteristics, how to monitor below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and how to add bacteria in order to
enhance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the nice thing is that we have a
mutual research areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all work together.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of our, this is just now
from a week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our greenhouse net houses
where you see the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the root and how to
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing everything in our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are really, really excited about
this Root of the Matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would like to thank all the people
who helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our great place in Sdebokir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to the desert in Israel,
you should come to Sdebokir.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have snow even.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a waterfall to see the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is our campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only scenery, we have flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's desert, but we have flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have endemic iris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, these are endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ibexes all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gardens are very well protected because
they eat everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also vultures and of course our
wiggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to invite you to the 10th
International Society of a conference
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be held in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are organizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't be in the desert because we
don't have enough place to accommodate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be not far from Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deadline for submitting is February
14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a student, we have a special
student ambassador program which will be
[SPEAKER_00]: in our institute where we sponsor
everything for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please submit and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question for Shimon.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the self and non-self groups,
I think over peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, peas.
Would you see the same thing if you used
clones so that the plants that you were
doing the self and non-self were genetic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think, yes, and we think also the
question could be even if we do different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that if we look at different
species, the effect will be much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: because the competition for resources is
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to genetically identical,
the competition should go increase and we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do it, but we believe it will
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenomena will increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly the same question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shimon, can you ask Geneva if you have
questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Geneva, do you have questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your work on the root order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that in corn roots, there's
constrictions between the where the
[SPEAKER_01]: junction between the first order roots and
the second order root is that it gives a
[SPEAKER_01]: very high hydraulic resistance right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing comparable things in other
species?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, so we just, in the root order thing,
we looked only at, we don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see, we looked at these orange
trees and now we're looking at tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in tomatoes, we don't see this thing
that you're talking about in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be very interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just could increase the effect,
I think, what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with your weevil story, which is
fascinating, it seems contradictory that
[SPEAKER_03]: an insect which is burrowing into and
eating the roots is actually having a
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiotic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you speculate the increase in
nitrogen is occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I don't think they're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the roots, they're not
eating, they're just getting exudates from
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nitrogen is just, you know,
the weevils are going to the toilet and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is getting nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a hypothesis, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really tried very hard to grow them in
these terrariums, but no success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just what we saw is the weevils are
going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are still trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydroponics, in trees, we don't see
these root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing in the hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant doesn't, they don't develop
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydroponics, this is, yeah,
it would be very nice to go to the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be able to look just on the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll need to look at cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: With hair and without hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is a thing we thought of
doing as the next looking at plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and looking at the role of hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does weevil have the nitrogen fixation
bacteria in their coat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you see that over time in the area
that it's growing with, with those plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you see an increase in the soil
nitrogen concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said we saw a correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have more weevils, we have more
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what is the egg,
what is the hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the weevils are going to an area
with more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the plants or in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: In both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw at the end, I saw a correlation with
nitrate and nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at 16 different areas,
abundance of weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we had more weevils, we had more
nitrogen and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the grafting study with peppers,

[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy working with companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we run out of time, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Shimon, for a
fascinating lecture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
