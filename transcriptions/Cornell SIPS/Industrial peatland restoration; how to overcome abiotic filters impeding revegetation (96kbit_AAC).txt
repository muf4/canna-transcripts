[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Neil and Bill,
for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really honored to come on this
fellowship here to tell you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more, maybe, how we are managing the
resource, the peat resource, in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say we, we can talk a little
bit about we, because it involves the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian Spineum Peat Moss Association,
which regroups all the peat producers of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been working in collaboration
with them since 1992, exchanging
[SPEAKER_00]: information and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more specifically today, I will talk
about all we go about to restore
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial peatland and the main factors
that impede this recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plan for today, I will talk a
little bit about the restoration context
[SPEAKER_00]: in North America, which is different than
what's going on in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restoration ecology of peatland,
so introducing our conceptual framework of
[SPEAKER_00]: research, and the main ability factor
impeding, and talking about how we go
[SPEAKER_00]: about to evaluate success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I will check, somebody will check
on time, and if I have time, then,
[SPEAKER_00]: because most I will talk about
sphynum-dominated peatland, or the sphynum
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss, but I can start with what we're
doing with fenn research, fenn restoration
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pool also, restoration within the
peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the business of our cultural peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are impacting an ecosystem
environment, why should we go on to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that if there's alternative?
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some alternative to using
peat in growing media, such as the core,
[SPEAKER_00]: the coco fibers, or rock wall,
or, but all of them will have its array of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in terms of its use, it's an
environmental problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat is good just, the people that do not
know sphynum, it's because they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing cell structure of alternating
living cells and dead cells with lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works a little bit like a slinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can compress it, but as soon as you
reduce the pressure, then you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really good that wicking the water
and having water into the substrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping some water there, but also with
all this porous aeration, and we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen down to the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the basic, that's a good
cation exchange capacity and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Neil and Bill could tell you a lot
more about f property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a fantastic medium to grow
plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not so easy to all at once get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried that in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: They forced the government just ban the
use of peat, but they realized the
[SPEAKER_00]: professional growers just could not go
away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to tell you a little bit about,
a little bit more about why it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to shift and get rid all at once of
the peat, is we're thinking compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in the last 10, 15 years,
we all agree composting now green residue
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot, it's more stable, and we can get
better growing media out of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem in places like in Europe
or central Europe is that the green
[SPEAKER_00]: residue are used for the thermal station
to produce energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are not easily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a product that it's too costly
for the professional grower to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then for them, they rely on peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you go for the core coming
from the cocoa fibers, then again,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other issue when you look at the
overall life cycle analysis, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently the transport is kind of
polluting on these old boats also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean with these diesel boats that are not
so up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have to, all this product,
I'm not saying this is yet the best thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, but I think now we have to look
more at the overall picture, the social
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, the traveling, and the whole life
cycle analysis of the different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you harvest a peatland,
usually set ditches every 30 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the main ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have this vacuum drawn tractor
that will harvest the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you harrow the peat surface,
let it dry in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, three days later, you go with a big
vacuum, pick it up, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four millimeters at a time, drop the peat
there, then you charge it onto trucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some large scale operation will look
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one, we don't see trees,
we don't see seeds, nothing is left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing, we know that 30 centimeters
below the soil, the peatland, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question we ask, what is the
ecological distance to restore this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we fix this gap between what you
saw and what a natural peatland can look
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just say what I'm showing today
comes from, it's been developed with lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, it's not all at once,
it looks easy, but we worked 20 years in
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership with the Canadian peat
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like I have close to 22
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it works in Canada is that the
federal government, the research council,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say that if the industry is
interested, when they put one dollar,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put one dollar for financing the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more or less, it's the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through these 20 years,
there was numerous postdocs, PhD students
[SPEAKER_00]: and master's students and research field
assistant and volunteer, even I know some
[SPEAKER_00]: students from Cornell came and worked up
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to say that I'm grateful for all
the work of these students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we work is first, we start by
comparing the reference ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: so which is the notion of these,
a set of natural ecosystem in a region to
[SPEAKER_00]: what has been degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at the degraded ecosystem to
see what is this ecological distance we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to fill?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do that by comparing from my
part, because I'm the plant ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are a multidisciplinary team.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that do the same thing with
hydrology or the microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I will more focus today on my
specialty within the team, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I compare the plant structure,
the composition, how it differ,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different functions, how it
differs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take Mill Peat, as I've shown
you, the distance is much greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: when we used to block out peat,
like this is what we used to do
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally, or the way that now,
that some people are still doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big distance is really more,
what my research has been focused mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: on this, but we are doing research in that
area that I will not talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do no management in a
sphynum-dominated peatland, we inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: 395 abandoned peat fields all across
Canada, mostly than the eastern part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the industry mostly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to draw your attention
that if you have natural peatland,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the vacuum, and here our
ecosystem, it's close to 600 plots that we
[SPEAKER_00]: took in natural peatland throughout the
eastern part of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, in general, in peatland,
you will find about 70, 75% of sphynum,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's barely any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you found there is mostly what
you found in the ditches, but not so much
[SPEAKER_00]: in the peat field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with the Ericusia shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more Ericusia shrub natural
peatland than in a degraded system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the bare peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no bare peat in the natural
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the same thing with FAN,
which is a different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, bog are dominated by sphynum mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAN are dominated by sedges and brown
mosses, another type of mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAN peat is starting more to go into
growing media, but mostly it's being used
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot for energy consumption in Ireland,
Central Europe, in Russia, Belarusia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we look in these different provinces,
including here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you go down in the peat
profile, in the peatland, you get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the FAN layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your peatland develops as a lake
bottom and will start to accumulate with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sedges, typhus, plants like that will
start to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you get your FAN peat,
where you still have inputs from the
[SPEAKER_00]: different streams around or from the
mineral ground flowing through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with time, you have accumulation
of the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then slowly you get rid of the influence
of the mineral trophy or from the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: from the runoff of the different streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get only the influence that the
system will be fed only by rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pH will go down, sphynum gets in
the system, sphynum will get the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks in the pH to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking now, comparing 22 peat
extracted FAN compared to 10 on this term,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we found that here there was two
techniques sometime of getting the peat
[SPEAKER_00]: out, sometime it was drain, not drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the sedges, the carrot
species, in actual peatland on much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance, where they are barely present
in these abundant system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sphynum, the richer sphynum
species, sphynum centrale and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not so much that you found, they're
closely not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that even though system has been
abandoned for a long time, up to 40 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second step now, we have to work to define
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do restoration,
you have to define your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know your goals, it's hard to
evaluate your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But goals cannot be done only by
scientists or ecologists minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take care of what's going on
around you in your society, in your
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ecologically, we know that the restore
ecosystem will not be like the original
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to define your goals that will
be there, but usually nobody will put,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just going to restore the original
ecosystem that was there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the same climatic history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be the same evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under a different climate now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely the restoration system,
the restore system will be there sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: in the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this time scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goal, defining goal, it's really
different, differs from your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved with people working in
Alaska and their main concern in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to work with a peatland,
there was company, then what is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest way we can again stabilize the
peat, so we won't get all the peat to go
[SPEAKER_00]: in the streams and clog the rivers that
are so important for the salmon industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fishing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you, if you talk with
anybody in Alaska, the first thing they
[SPEAKER_00]: will be thinking is, hey, peat should be
stabilized as soon as possible after we
[SPEAKER_00]: finish using the peat for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, with the peat industry,
the horticultural peat industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did several workshops and all that,
and after different discoveries,
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, the general long-term goal we
decided was to restore the most unique
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic that defines peatland
ecosystem, which is its capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate peat through time, so to
sequester carbon through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peatlands are the most efficient ecosystem
we have on this planet per square meter or
[SPEAKER_00]: per volume that can sequester carbon in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you'll have the coal
formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the peat is more efficient
than you can have forest, because forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant trees, but 200 years down the
line, the trees die again, and the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: is put back into the recirculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the general long-term goal that
we put together, because in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: in mostly in Canada, we were in a wetland
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a wetland system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we leave it, usually birch will invade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will turn into a birch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birch woodland or pine woodland,
and we have plenty of woodlands in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in southern, even though we have a lot
of peatlands in Canada, there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have so many in the south nearby
the urban area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's a lot of pressure on the
wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we decided to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was influenced by the
Canadian-USA policy of no net loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: wetland, and the USA wetland hacks
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it was influenced by that
is because the clients are mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: American.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85, 80-85% of the peat is sold in the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are taking into account some of
the concerns that the clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restoration limits, like I told you,
impossible to restore the original
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem prior to peat extracting
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not one of the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat is not a renewable resource within
human lifetime, but the potential is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here when I say, you always have to define
this when you start talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm talking, I'm just defining
the spatial area as being what is owned,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, by a peat company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare it to the potential of all
across Canada, here you could say peat is
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable because it's tiny what we are
extracting compared to the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: peatland we have in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it is on the primer frost and
not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short-term goal is really to favor the
establishment of sphynum mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, now, mostly I'm doing a lot of
research on the brown mosses, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the miniaturography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly it is well-known how these
sphynum mosses are really ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the key species in the northern
hemisphere to get peatland in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a third step that I'm skipping,
which is all the planification,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really important to succeed in
restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as ecologists, we work a lot on
defining what are the constraints to why
[SPEAKER_00]: is it that our system is not going along
that way naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we ameliorate this constraint?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be environmental, and that's
mostly all my earlier research has been
[SPEAKER_00]: done in the sphynum type of peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a problem of dispersion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I'm not doing much research on
this because we did it in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things do come in, the plants,
the spores, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the condition is so harsh,
nothing is established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we have to just bring the plant
material in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't hear much about research
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the interspecific interaction
and plant-plant interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do come in for the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will not discuss this much today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the process of ecosystem
restoration, then we will also do some
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if we do no management,
things that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the peat oxidation will
continue at a rate of 5.7 millimeters per
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a net carbon emission.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wonder, you use a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you abandon the system,
it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here, trees have established.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get uprooted through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's Dr. Maria Strack.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from University of Calgary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's really our carbon flux
specialist working on all this question
[SPEAKER_00]: within our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do no management, all the water
chemistry is unstable because it's coupled
[SPEAKER_00]: with, we get a greater water table
fluctuation also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a problem with nutrient and the
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, we work with Jonathan Price,
the peat and hydrology from University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Waterloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself, I do work on the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat erosion, the water will impede the
vegetation return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the wind will impede the
vegetation return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all these different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do, in some cases, do nothing,
we'll have the wood that will replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: sphynum mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either here you see the birches or the
pine woodlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get severe constraint by the frost
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't restore, here this is a
site I visited in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow in Colorado, 100 to 120 years ago,
the silver mine, they had to use peat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two colleagues, David Cooper
from University of Colorado, he's from
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder, and Rob Chambers from Michigan
Tech University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot of exchange because
they've been working on fan restoration
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're starting to adapt some of
our techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the straw mulch that you will see
later, but some of our techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sites, this is a site abandoned
between 100 and 120 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all the harsh conditions,
plants do not come back on the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, if you have a fan, then you get
this kind of ritual species that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to compete with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an example, we won't go
into that, but just to say that we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to introduce plants,
what can we do to help mostly the sphynum
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment?
[SPEAKER_00]: All our research has been paid to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the website where we have all
our publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in English, a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have access to all the publication
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wanted to say that what is in
yellow are the three necessary steps that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't omit one of these steps,
you won't succeed to restore peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to reintroduce your plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to protect it after that mulch it
because the mosses have no roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way of controlling the loss of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, even if you do those two
things, you need to block the former
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to re-wet the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of these three actions
will lead you, usually, to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of one of these, let's say,
line of work is the abiotic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peat surface, when we abandoned it,
can get very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really hot, up to 50 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, we were wondering, is it because
there's some toxicity that the plant don't
[SPEAKER_00]: come back?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, even nitrogen is there
because you have oxidation, but no plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is taking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have even more nitrogen than a
natural peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have this biological cross,
algae or lichen, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really impedes the mosses to have
access to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a breakage in the capillary
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to know, at the same time,
so I have my colleagues looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate, microclimate, and what's going on
in the hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself, I go in the lab, and then I
wanted to know, what kills the mosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are they dead, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I reintroduce them, what adverse
condition can they sustain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So either with temperature or here just
submitted them to some known relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity created by soil, like they were
suspended in the air, and then looking
[SPEAKER_00]: back for 10 weeks if they would start to
regrow again, if they were dead or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, I found out that if your
relative humidity is low just for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, everything is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is testing six different species
and different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we get somewhere, around 50%,
I know my plants can stay alive for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: six days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you have to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know relative humidity will
always go up in the night a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the hot days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to know what cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know even though you put your plants
there and a lot of that, if you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: drought period, you will lose all your
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, working in collaboration
with people working on microclimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we look at what does the addition of
the straw mulch compare when you are bare
[SPEAKER_00]: peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we ameliorated a lot our
interface condition between the peat and
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to try different type
of mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did up to 17 different type.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just happened that the straw mulch,
which is the cheapest and decomposed
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, when you get all the spina,
that was the one that worked really
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rewetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some, tried some re-wetting when
we just, you see this is a drain piton
[SPEAKER_00]: here where the water table fluctuation,
this is the water table will be between 80
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter below the surface and 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing to, as August gets drier,
we go down to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A natural peat will also do the same
thing, but not go so much lower than 40
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know in general, we have to keep
around that figure to have the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we knew that if we block the
ditches, we have to try to re-wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sufficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is good in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when again you arrive in the drought
period in July, August, we still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: gap that is too much to keep the plants
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's action that needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you only block the ditches,
you don't get your water table back to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the mulch will do the
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A combination of re-wetting and mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to do bunds and bankmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than just blocking the ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we redistribute the water through the
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the whole peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look, this is a site that we
restored in New Brunswick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was almost a meter and a half,
two meters different between this pool
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the peatland and this road access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, your scale, this is 30 meters
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see these bunding within to keep
the water, to redistribute it and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: it would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compare, then we put these water
wells all across it and into the unrestore
[SPEAKER_00]: part just to see where we were hard at
into our restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now follow me because it's a bit,
it's easy, but it's just we inverted the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just look at the water table on the
top, this is, the red is the restore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural peatland, harvested peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and again, this is minus, I mean 20
centimeters below the peat surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how the restore is actually
wetter even than the natural nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: peatland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really good in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is more important for the planet,
it's not so much the water table and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a group should know that it's more
you than our psychologist in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the tension, the water tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the mosses, the sphynum
mosses, you need to keep it above minus
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 millibar in order that the cell can
have access to the water from the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this is the reverse from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the restore at the green line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the untreated, so the
unrestore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just look, we know now this is really
not good for the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do a combination of blocking and
redistributing the water, we keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: sphynum that we just reintroduced within
above that minus 100 millibars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this combination of these two
action that we know works best for the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now through all this process, we do some
short term monitoring and some longer term
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a developing process because
we're doing some small trials to solve a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, but we're doing some large scale
one and trying to see and how to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through this loop of monitoring,
and this is this is the important
[SPEAKER_00]: important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If ever any of you get involved in the
restoration ecology project and an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological restoration project,
there's need to be a component three and
[SPEAKER_00]: five years down the line at least to go
back and see if you know what's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell dot edu.
Thank you very much.
