[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the introduction
and also thanks a lot for hosting me
[SPEAKER_00]: during this semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me in the back?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot hear me, if I'm losing my
voice, just raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about this presentation
because it will allow me to share with you
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the research that I've been doing
for the last 10, 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be probably jumping from one
topic to the next one, highlighting some
[SPEAKER_00]: results and sort of glossing over the
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to go into more details on
the things that we did and the results,
[SPEAKER_00]: just let me know and I will be more than
happy to meet with you after this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I said research that I've been
doing for the last 10 or 12 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually I'm saying research that was done
by my great grad students and postdocs and
[SPEAKER_00]: also in collaboration with many colleagues
here at Montana State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of us, we need to thank the many,
many, many undergrads that help us every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a good place to start this
presentation is by looking at this paper
[SPEAKER_00]: that was published a few years ago and
basically what they did is they summarized
[SPEAKER_00]: 89 studies that basically came from almost
1,500 individual case studies where they
[SPEAKER_00]: have checked the landscape complexity
around those 1,500 places and checked the
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance and diversity of beneficial
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They focused on pollinators and natural
enemies and they checked the functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: and the services they obtained from those
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, as you see here,
as you increase the abundance of both
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators or natural enemies,
they saw an increase in the pollination or
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing they did is
through a couple of paths analysis they
[SPEAKER_00]: assessed the relationship between the
landscape complexity, those beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms and the services in that
particular case was yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as we decrease the
landscape complexity of the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we simplify the system, we see a
negative impact on the abundance and
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of those beneficial organisms
and the positive relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: those beneficial organisms and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that I noticed from these
studies and you probably noticed as well
[SPEAKER_00]: is that although they came from around the
world, the great majority of them came
[SPEAKER_00]: from Europe and from here the Northeast
part of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I come from Montana, which is part of
the Great Plains region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably one of the leading
regions in the world in production of
[SPEAKER_00]: small grains, wheat, barley, wool crops
and forage crops and all seed crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, there were no studies that
were conducted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been in Montana outside
Bozeman, Yellowstone, Big Sky,
[SPEAKER_00]: the touristic area, you probably know that
it looks more or less something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the most simplified
systems that can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have across the state,
it varies, but we have regions where
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation can be around nine to 11
inches of precipitation per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers like to leave 50% of their land in
fallow to basically accumulate moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the last 20 years or so,
there's been quite a big push towards
[SPEAKER_00]: diversifying the cropping systems and
including wool crops, all seed crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, that's the landscape that
dominate these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I arrived to Montana in 2004,
I quickly learned that tillage is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really a good option there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we have three months without
rains and 90, 95 degrees and really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: winds, you will lose the soil due to
erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our farmers basically have a known till
fallows, which means repeated applications
[SPEAKER_00]: of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the crop year, it's a little
bit more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say they have a series of
herbicides they can choose from depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on which species they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they come from two families,
group one and group two, ACCA and ALS
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I learned about this, I sort of
thought this was the most boring place to
[SPEAKER_00]: do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was nothing, nothing to
really motivate myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I'm sitting here in this
really simple system except that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look carefully, you really notice that
ecosystems are not equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are differences in the ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start working with my first grad
student, Fred Polnak, in assessing the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, weed communities in organic and
conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to my surprise, no study have even
worked on weed communities in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, sort of similar to what
has been found in other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic systems, you have a different
community of weeds, more diverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: more abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question we asked was,
so what, could this be having an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work on, for acetoids, as well as
pollinators, but for the next 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, I will be talking about
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may be asking me, well,
why do we care about pollinators in a
[SPEAKER_00]: system that is dominated by wheat and
fallow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason is that, like I said,
there's a huge interest in diversifying
[SPEAKER_00]: this cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, of course, economic
benefits for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, lentils, Montana is the number one
producer of organic lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of money with these
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have many native species that
require pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, assessing pollinators in this really
extremely large field was a challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very lucky to be able to recruit
Subodh Adhikari, who was my PhD student
[SPEAKER_00]: then, stay as a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now in University of Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to check the abundance and
diversity of pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: He focused on bees in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to the best of my knowledge,
no study has addressed pollinators across,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these agricultural systems,
across the whole Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Plain region, we couldn't find any
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Subodh did is he went to the north
part, north central part of Montana,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called the Golden Triangle,
where the wheat production is
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for three years, he selected three
organic and three conventional fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to show you how simplified these
landscapes are, he basically quantified
[SPEAKER_00]: the different systems or ecosystems they
have in radius of 250 up to two
[SPEAKER_00]: kilometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you move two kilometers from the
fields, you still have close to 80% of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing except wheat or
crops, basically, and barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic farmers tend to have more
diversified rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his hypothesis was that if you have
more abundance and diversity of forms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic systems, then you should have
healthier pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be assessed at the
individual level and at the colony level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have larger individuals and
more successful colonies in the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the conventional fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Subodh did is in each one of these
fields, at least 250 meters from any
[SPEAKER_00]: border, so in the middle of the crop
fields, he established transects where he
[SPEAKER_00]: put five of these bumblebee colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weighed the colonies before putting
them in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left them there for two months and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we retrieve them and dissect the
colonies back in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He then checked for the health of the
individual bees by checking the lipid
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that the bees don't fly a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be investing much energy in
flying, and therefore they will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate more lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also if they fly less, their wings
will be more intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he also checked for how intact were the
wing markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also checked for the pollen that
were found in the bodies of those bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that because he also sampled
the vegetation, he then could be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less infer where those bees were
foraging from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he dissected the colonies and
checked for the number of reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and the number of cells with
nectars, and also the number of males and
[SPEAKER_00]: workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first results in terms of
the pollen coming from the bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: he noticed that there were no difference
between, this is just one year and the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year, there were no differences in
the pollen that was collected from bees
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the organic and conventional
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is sort of suggesting that they're
actually flying all around the landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the most abandoned pollen came from
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, suggesting that they fly,
find the alfalfa, and then they may come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably because of that, there's more
weeds in the organic fields, and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of volunteer alfalfa as well,
those bees have individual bees were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to accumulate more lipids in their bodies,
and their wings were more intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's telling us that they have
their food, suggesting that the food of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sources for pollen and nectar are
closer to the colonies than in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional fields that have to fly a
couple of kilometers to find those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when he looked at the relative growth
rate of the colony, it was larger in the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fields versus the conventional
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he looked at the number of
reproductive cells, as well as cells with
[SPEAKER_00]: a nectar, he found more cells in the
organic fields on colonies that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fields than the conventional
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, there was a positive
relationship between the flower density,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the species richness, and the growth
rate for both years that he conducted the
[SPEAKER_00]: study, and the number of reproductive
cells, as well as the number of nectar
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step, he did was to assess
what is the relationship, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have healthier individuals that
these translate into healthier communities
[SPEAKER_00]: of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his idea was that again, less pollen
sources in the conventional fields should
[SPEAKER_00]: translate in less abundant, less diverse,
big communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, the networks between
flowers and pollinators should be weaker
[SPEAKER_00]: in the conventional fields versus the
organic fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things he did was establish
these pollen crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was trapping pollinators in all
these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a pretty witty field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the organic fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, he assess the Forbes
abundance and richness, and he spent hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and hours just walking in a long transect,
and then checking if one individual bee
[SPEAKER_00]: will land on the flower, and I think the
bee and the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he found is
that there were no differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities of bees between organic and
conventional fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it suggests that they are all
flying around the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he saw was a shift in bee communities
within the growing season, but no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference across the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference came in the networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he looked at the number of times a
bee landed on a flower in a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: field, there were very few flowers,
and he only found three species and six
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was significantly weaker than the
network that he observed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember that I said that the most
abundant pollen we observed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bumblebees was alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened that alfalfa is the main
source of the main place where those bees
[SPEAKER_00]: landed in the conventional field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think that a farmer will be
successful in killing all the volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa, and if that happens, then if he
gets result of the alfalfa, and if we
[SPEAKER_00]: think of a landscape where there's no
organic fields, basically 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators will disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the organic system,
if for whatever reason we don't have more
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer alfalfa, which is going to be a
little bit more difficult because organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers don't have access to those
selective herbicides, still every single
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator will be able to find a source
of pollen and nectar in another species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, what Subodh was seeing is
that the enhanced fluid resource that you
[SPEAKER_00]: observe in our organic system correlates
with an increase in the individual and
[SPEAKER_00]: colony success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have more stable pollinator
flower networks in the organic system
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the conventional system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start thinking, well, is that the
idea again that if you lose the alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_00]: you lose the pollinators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that saying that the organic systems
are more resilient than the conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many, many, many ways by which
you can assess resilience in a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just show you one of the
things that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, this was done at this site,
which is located, I think, four miles out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Bozeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we had there is a
five-year rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we started with safflower
interseeded with clover that stayed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next year as a cover crop,
then winter wheat, lentils, and winter
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have three reps, each crop present
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we found this rotation
following three systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was the conventional
non-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that system was basically dependent on
the use of fertilizer and fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use any insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't need to use any insecticides
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, the repeated use of
herbicides results in the selection of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide-resistant biotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have currently six biotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm missing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, seven biotypes of seven species that
have biotypes which are resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of those species have shown multiple
herbicide-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the case of wild oats,
Avena fatua.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some biotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have multiple herbicide-resistant,
and it's resistant to basically any
[SPEAKER_00]: in-crop herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers have no more herbicide to
manage wild oats if they get that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other kind of case of concern is
kosher, because it has multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide-resistant, but it also has
resistant to glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a big, big challenge to be
managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other system we had was an organic
non-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this system, basically, we were
terminating the cover crop and managing
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds by using tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said, there are areas in
Montana where we have around nine to 11
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of precipitation, a couple of
months without rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use a lot of tillage,
the main problem is soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third system that we thought as an
alternative was an organic system where we
[SPEAKER_00]: would use the tillage by incorporating
grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically use sheep to terminate
the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And manage the weeds before seeding and
post harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, we did a lot of studies
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assessed yields and pathogens and
ground beetles and greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to concentrate on this idea of
resiliency today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to stress these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to stress the system,
climate change, is the place to start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, it is a major problem in
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the predictions for climate
change under the worst case scenario of
[SPEAKER_00]: the IPCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what they did is they
divided Montana in seven regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the 12 month of the year,
the prediction is that we are already
[SPEAKER_00]: having warmer and drier months of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole year is getting warmer and
drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prediction for moisture are a little
more iffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy to make those
predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the prediction is that we're
going to get more moisture in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: and spring and the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's going to be mostly in
the form of rainfall, not snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to be able to
accumulate so much of a snowpack that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need for then growing the crops during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major problem is that the
prediction suggests that during the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season, June, July, and August is
going to be actually drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have warmer and drier summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more evaporation
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to simulate these scenarios,
basically, we have these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what we call an open top chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we were able to increase
temperatures by around one and a half to
[SPEAKER_00]: two Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the top of those open top
chambers, we included these rain out
[SPEAKER_00]: shelters where we further decreased
moisture by around 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure soil temperature and soil
moisture during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that we did was to
assess plant responses to these different
[SPEAKER_00]: three systems and three climate scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of a little bit to my surprise,
climate, the temperature and moisture was
[SPEAKER_00]: significant, but it has a very slight
impact on those wheat plant communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cropping system was deemed the most
important variable, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the teal organic system,
the graze organic system, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something that really surprised me is
that, I mean, from previous studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that the conventional and organic
systems are different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of already know these difference
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeing the graze organic system more
similar to the conventional system versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the teal system was sort of a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can think that in terms of the
community assembly of those weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is basically saying that tillage
seems to be the driving factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reduce tillage, the amount of
tillage in the graze organic system now
[SPEAKER_00]: became to be more similar to the
conventional system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no till than the teal organic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tillage appears to be more important as
a filtering variable than herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hypothesis that you may want to
test later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we did was to assess
the impact of these different systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and temperature conditions on
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early spring, coming out of winter,
when they have a lot of moisture and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer, in the hotter condition,
those spring wheat was really good in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison with the ambient and the hotter
and drier conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we harvest the wheat,
it was very clear that the hotter was
[SPEAKER_00]: already getting a nail, but the warmer and
drier, it just basically could not do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, the relationship between wheat
yield and, in this case, is cheap grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bromus tectorum, sort of the number one
grassy weed in winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this nonlinear negative
relationship, but it was more pronounced
[SPEAKER_00]: in the warmer and drier conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, we are seeing a shift in
above-ground plant communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly due to management systems and also
with some effect on the climate scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that the health of the system
and the resiliency of the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is on the soil characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to check the below-ground
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I was really lucky because
I was able to work with Sue Isaac,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's now in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did is she sampled the
different crops and management scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm going to concentrate on the
wheat scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we notice here is that the
evenness and the abundance of taxonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: units kind of interact with the different
cropping system, the non-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic graze, and the organic till
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the results were all across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to see any trend, except that
in the organic graze system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional non-till system, we saw kind
of a delay in the peak of the abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: those taxonomic units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the organic graze system was
more similar to the conventional system,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-till system, than to the organic till
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't expecting that result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we notice is that as we
increase soil temperature, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in the abundance of those
taxonomic units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were able to find 11 taxonomic
units that are associated with the current
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions, 17 with the
warmer, and 14 with the warmer and drier
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we experimentally decrease
moisture, we also saw a decrease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of taxonomic units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question we ask is, could that be
impacting the behavior of the system and
[SPEAKER_00]: the resiliency of the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer that question, we conducted a
greenhouse study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what we did, we went to
each one of these three systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these three climate scenarios,
and we collected soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically have a soil inoculum,
which is basically 4% of the total biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: that we put in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have steam sterilized soils in steam
sterilized pots, and we just added 4% in
[SPEAKER_00]: volume, like a teaspoon of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sort of inoculated the pot with soil
coming from each one of the three systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and each one of the three different
climate scenarios, and we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have wheat in the field,
we grew wheat, and then we harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat, and we grew wheat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have wheat over wheat over wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our conditioning, and then we have
our response phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the response phase, we grew either
wheat or a phylogenetically different
[SPEAKER_00]: distant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we use pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we analyzed these was by
calculating the soil feedbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the soil feedback is the
natural log of the biomass when it is
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated, divided the biomass when it's
not inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So above zero means that the plants with
the inoculation, that inoculum enhances
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth of the plant, and below zero
means that it inhibits the growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, it's an assessment on the
impact of those soil microbial communities
[SPEAKER_00]: on the growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to use these
phylogenetically different species because
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of years before that study with
Zach Miller, we conducted a study where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have 11 conditioning species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grab soil from prairies and crop
fields, and we have 11 conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow them for several generations,
and then we grew four different response
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to see if we could predict
the soil feedback based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetic distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we noticed is that as you
increase the phylogenetic distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feedbacks tend to go from more
negative to more positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you grow wheat over wheat over
wheat, we know you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing pathogenic microorganisms,
and you're going to have these negative
[SPEAKER_00]: feedbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you rotate your crops, that's a
base of crop rotation, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to grow wheat on the barley
and wheat barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a real rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have three systems,
three climate conditions, wheat over wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: over wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we planted wheat, because it's
the same species phylogenetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we expected to see an increase in
pathogenic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we expected to see more
negative feedback and the less negative
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback will be that the system is more
resistant to the accumulation of those
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it doesn't accumulate those
pathogens that fast, then it will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to that pathogenic community or
the development of a pathogenic community
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grew a phylogenetically different
species, P, we expected to now see,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, potential decrease in those
pathogenic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expected to see either less
negative feedback or even positive
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the faster they can recover,
we can think that's an estimate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resiliency of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to present the soil
feedback centered on zero means no impact
[SPEAKER_00]: for the three systems, non-teal,
grazed, and teal-organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above zero, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's promotion of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below zero, there's inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we noticed is that when we grew
wheat over wheat over wheat over wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the non-teal conventional and the
grazed organic system, again, those two
[SPEAKER_00]: systems behave similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw more positive or less negative
feedback close to zero in the case of the
[SPEAKER_00]: teal-organic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can say that the teal-organic system
is more resistant, probably because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are mixing the soil quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't allow that accumulation of
pathogenic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you go to Montana and start
talking about tillage, remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the chances of losing soil due to
erosion are very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news here is that the three
systems and the current climate conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same level of resiliency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is under current climate
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we look at the predicted climate
conditions, that's warmer and drier
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we notice is that we lost the
resistance of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we lost the resiliency of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we are shifting with
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are hurting crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are losing the resiliency and
resistance of our crop fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, what I wanted to show is
that even these incredibly simplified
[SPEAKER_00]: systems are very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these systems, just a change in the
management practices could enhance the
[SPEAKER_00]: associated biodiversity in terms of having
different communities of weeds that will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bottom-up effect on the beneficial
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will have healthier and more
diverse community of pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, under predicted climate
conditions, unfortunately, the scenario is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that even these highly simplified
systems are, that's what I learned after
[SPEAKER_00]: being almost 20 years in Montana,
is that even these extremely simplified
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, you can still have fun and do
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have a few minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's first of all thank Fabian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be that simplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks for a great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fun to see all the agroecology
in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to some of the work on
pollinators and weeds in the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: versus conventional systems, it seems like
a lot of the negative effect of those
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds is going to be a reduction in yield,
whereas some of that positive effect would
[SPEAKER_03]: be for pollinators potentially in some of
the nearby systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit of a spatial mismatch
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about how that might affect
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the farmer's decision-making
around weighing these costs versus
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was to see how farmers will
perceive the potential benefits of weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the cost of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I did not show,
because I'm kind of steering into the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of resistant residency, is that one
of the studies we did before the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse study and before the
phylogenetic study, the first thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we did with Sue Isaac was to go to,
I think it was four pair of organic and
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional fields kind of fence apart
and take soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, sure enough, we were able to see
that the microbial communities were
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by the management systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a similar plant soil
feedback study where we saw that if the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop receives an inoculum of coming from
the organic system, happens that crop weed
[SPEAKER_00]: competition was decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of a hypothesis,
Rich Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you were there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the new hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I remember the whole title of that
paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the resource pool hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that actually in those systems
would have more diversified, you correct
[SPEAKER_00]: me, you have more diversified cropping
plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be able to forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a different microbial
communities associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they will be foraging for
different pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the crop weed competition
is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, what I'm saying is that if
you go to an organic field and you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor, you see it's pretty weedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something Bruce Maxwell told me
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at the crop and you're like,
oh my God, the crop is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think organic farmers don't have the
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't spray it, so they have to live
with those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happened that it doesn't appear to
be as competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said that the future is pretty dire
for weed in Montana, at the very end
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Given your experience there, what would
your recommendations be for farmers facing
[SPEAKER_04]: that situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was quite a lot of first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm teaching research,
but I was doing extension for the first 17
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I did was going
around Montana and gave quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about climate change and weeds even
12 years ago when it wasn't really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to raise the
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're not aware and when you
start showing like, hey, your herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to be working because the
stomata closes, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers start to react to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first will be to raise the awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, there is an interest and some
people are saying we may need to move into
[SPEAKER_00]: more winter weed versus spring weed
because that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get hit by those really dry
summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also some interesting
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weed breeders have been breeding some
varieties which are more control
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and trying to find crop
rotations which are also less demanding in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Montana, it's going to be a huge
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a huge, huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is if this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grad student who did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she promised me two years ago that she
was going to publish the paper next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fortunately, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabian, excellent presentation here and
thanks for sharing it with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit
about the wheat fallow and alternative
[SPEAKER_02]: crops that you could insert into that
system and opportunities for increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: water use efficiency with key or other
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard stories maybe from like Randy
Anderson and other people about putting in
[SPEAKER_02]: peas and seeing a positive yield response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the person to ask will be
perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's our cropping system specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically related to your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he's been working quite a lot
trying to find more efficient crop
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the diversification of the
cropping system builds that bring pull
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic farmers love lentils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in terms of water use efficiency
and nitrogen, it brings a positive impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the wheat fallow system sort of
unfortunately keeps staying around because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be using my sociological hat
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgive me, sociologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the farmers tend to be 65 or
older, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are like, I've been doing this
for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to change now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is kind of I mean, there's a lot of
evidence that there's a benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic benefits for rotating,
incorporating these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mentality still is that we want to
manage as we did before the last several
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: The positive effects on that is if you
think it's more of the it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how you can get an increase in
water use efficiency when you have a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of a fallow period.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are these other effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more in terms of the overall
net benefits, economic benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: net revenues of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you have instead of having fallow
that just cost money, you have another
[SPEAKER_00]: source of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, what Perry's saying is that
it's not as bad as thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a net benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm talking about the driest
places in Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking north, central Montana,
like these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to northeast Montana and
probably southeast Montana where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely more moisture, that's not the
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the highly simplified
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: No,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was, like I said, in the three
systems, you lost that resistance because
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic till system lost that
resiliency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three systems that have slightly
positive, perhaps I didn't explain
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, slightly positive feedbacks in
the current climatic conditions where we
[SPEAKER_00]: added the P, they kind of went to have
zero or slightly negative feedback in the
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer and drier conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they became less resilient.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system was wheat over wheat over wheat
or wheat wheat P. So wheat wheat P is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you rotate the crop, you get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that as a proxy to assess
resiliency, how fast the system recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recovered really well in current
conditions, but they did not recover
[SPEAKER_00]: almost at all in the future climatic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep having wheat over wheat
over wheat, which is the worst management
[SPEAKER_00]: decision, it will be bad for any one of
the three systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned how the organic
no-till-brace system behaviors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine if an at-organic matter in
the form of trans-economic sheet and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on, that it would do better than a
relatively dead, shallow trans-economic
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we study it similarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: How similar is it still?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing the organic-brace versus the
conventional no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that system, we did not have
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, we have a five-year
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was safflower, clover, interseeded,
then winter wheat, lentils, winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, we were thinking that just the
organic matter that sheep was distributing
[SPEAKER_00]: will enhance the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm going to be answering
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one asked me, is organic-brace the
solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, because actually,
at the fifth year, we got fourth year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then by the fifth year, we got totally
nailed by Canada's diesel, the perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suspected they were coming out of the
system, and we just could not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sheep will just look at it and go
like, I'm eating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very enthusiastic for three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the agronomy of the
system, at least that rotation was not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best one for perennial wheat, which is the
image upon the keys of death in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
