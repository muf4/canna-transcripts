[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: But IR4 project, I'm not going to talk a
lot about this, but what we do is we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly funded program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is USDA funds, but some of
the money comes into the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at Rutgers University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually a Rutgers employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the money comes in, and we really
develop regulatory type of data to
[SPEAKER_00]: register products for specialty crops and
minor uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really looking at those growers that
industry doesn't find registering products
[SPEAKER_00]: for them profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we do it for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the word from my sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually been doing this type of
work for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're celebrating our 50-year anniversary
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want to talk about today
is really ag trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking with Brad, I have a new name
for what it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said free trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really free trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really a technical barrier to
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about pesticide residues and
whatnot in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really want to just give you an idea
of what trade looks like, ag trade and
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what's the most exciting is
what's really happened in the last five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really since 2008, things kind of dropped
a little bit, but it's just been on a
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid growth since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from 2010, it was $115
billion US exports going out to other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it increased to $141 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In just those two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really see the rapid amount of
increase that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in many of the ag industries,
we can see those increases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and Mexico has always been the US
major ag trade partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always run with a surplus in our
trade to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have Canada here, the red line,
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had a little drop in 2008 in
many of the markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's been a steady increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a steady increase with Canada
and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one to really look at it is really
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that it's just been a steady
increase from about $7 billion up to over
[SPEAKER_00]: $25 billion of ag commodities going to
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU is a little bit more of a mature
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't really changed too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a number of legislative
and other policies that have been in
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that I think has probably precluded
some of the growth in that area too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put India on here just to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another country there with over a
billion people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a market that's still out there
that's waiting to be exercised and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can increase our exports to India as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at it by commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost $15 billion of that $25-plus
billion going to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's soybeans going over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then soybeans in our other Canada,
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's several billion
dollars there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get to the next commodities,
you can see that the value isn't nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at fresh vegetables going
to Canada, that's our primary market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lettuce, the onions, a lot of the
fresh vegetables that we export,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of those are really going to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look at pulses, beans,
peas, dry beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico's probably one of our largest
markets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the EU is also a significant
amount of market there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these commodities,
they actually may be exported to the EU,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they go to other countries as
well from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU is our primary exporter for tree
nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1.7 billion going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other markets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the products, this is actually
from 2001 to 2003, but this is the percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of crop growing that is going out to the
other markets, out for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the almonds and cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 70% of the commodities being
exported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapes, almost 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans, pulses, apples, probably citrus,
pears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put these on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2001, 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think most all of the ag expansion
has not been domestic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been going to export markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think really, even though this is
from 2001, 2003, probably these
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities have far exceeded this 20% to
30% of the market going to export.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably closer to 50% now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, this is from 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exports were about $60,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: $22 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier, we're over $140
billion now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does that impact the work
environment and contributing to other
[SPEAKER_00]: economic activities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural exports that support
additional services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're shipping things
international, you have the truck drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are taking it to the ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have other commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potatoes gets chipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: French fries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supporting all the other business
activity more than doubles the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact that you have from these export
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty good story there on
what's happening internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want to talk about is
you have pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to control pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to maintain a high quality
product when you're going to be exporting
[SPEAKER_00]: these commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pests really influence that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pesticides currently are really a
reality for these large volumes of
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities that we're producing and
exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've borrowed a lot of slides
throughout my presentations from the
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign ag service from different grower
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a comment that was provided by
the California Citrus Quality Council at a
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting that I was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they feel that the pesticides are
really, they need those technologies to
[SPEAKER_00]: control plant diseases and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have to have it to maintain a
high level of phytosanitary demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then growers large and small depend on
pesticides to control plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I added weeds here too, Robin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't let that go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about some of the
pesticides that are really more important
[SPEAKER_00]: to the IPM programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the newer ones that actually work
into IPM programs more so than the older
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to talk to those in a few
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll continue to play a key role in
the IPM programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this technical trade barrier,
this thing that may cause problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: our so-called free trade, it's the maximum
pesticide residue levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what a legally allowable
amount is allowed on food and feed stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what results on the commodity
after it's been used according to a good
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural practice or according to the
pesticide label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you have some of these
residues from the pesticide that persist
[SPEAKER_00]: on the commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for import tolerances,
the import tolerance is an MRL that's set
[SPEAKER_00]: on the basis of the foreign registered
good agricultural practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just some other considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to maintain a high level of
productivity, the growing world
[SPEAKER_00]: population, the food exports and imports
will obviously continue to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the growers, especially here in
the United States, really grow to support
[SPEAKER_00]: a global market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, we all like to have
fresh fruits and vegetables when we go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is from the citrus growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the growers really don't grow a
commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really sure where that
commodity is going to go when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't really manage their
production for a specific market that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even the processors will mix lots
and mingle things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no MRL in any of the markets
that they're going to, then generally the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide isn't used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see for citrus some of the
major markets that they're shipping to
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food Quality Protection Act was passed
in 1996, and it really changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigm of products that we use when we
grow our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's reduced risk products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably 90% of the markets that
are on the market are reduced risk
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the organophosphate insecticides
and other classes of insecticides have
[SPEAKER_00]: either been removed from the market or
they've been significantly restricted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these uses have been replaced
by safer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to mention is as a result of
the Food Quality Protection Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually required a more comprehensive
risk assessment of each of the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that risk assessment process,
they actually determined it wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: the commodities that were the issue,
but in most cases it was the applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of those insecticides were removed
from the market because of the applicator
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure and they were exceeding the safe
levels for the applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also finally, many of the new products
are really more IPM compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more IPM compatible because they
don't impact the beneficials to the level
[SPEAKER_00]: that the older products did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used at more specific sites of
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a slide that was given to me from
the Northwest Hoard Council and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of went through what were the
products they use in 1983 to control
[SPEAKER_00]: coddling moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azinephos methyl, Phosmit, I don't even
know what this one is, Fosalone,
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylparathion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all knew Methylparathion was
bad in 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still being used in 98,
but now really the only organophosphate is
Phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these other ones are
considered reduced risk products,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the Chloranthranapril and the
methoxyphenicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these work on very specific sites of
action on the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you continue to use a lot of them,
you're going to get resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the toolbox has to be bigger so you can
rotate your chemistries and prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan, before you go on, can you tell people
what reduced risk is so that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: what that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have another slide coming up and
I'll talk about that a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really when you talk about risk,
you're talking about the hazard and the
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about reduced risk
products, you mostly focus on the hazard
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exposure may be equal to or greater on
the reduced risk products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exposure may be equal to or greater on
these because many of these, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need applicator protection equipment when
you're making the applications because the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of hazard is so low that they don't
have to be concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if they're applying Fosmet,
they're going to have the overhauls on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a lot of these other compounds,
really, probably all you need is rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and maybe some splash apron or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the reduced risk, we're really
talking about the hazard part of the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, I have a little bit of a
cold right now, so I sound a little
[SPEAKER_00]: rougher than I normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IPM, again, I think we talked about a
lot of that, but how these new products
[SPEAKER_00]: really fit into IPM programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, actually, that was submitted to
the agency really just about a year ago is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually even safe to the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's safe to bees and other pollinators
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this transition from the
OPs, reduced risk, and these products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are moving into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem that we're having is we've
registered these products for the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US, but some of the other countries
don't recognize those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never seen the tox packages that
were used to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're exporting our commodities
abroad, then they say, well, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if the residues from this compound are
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what I'm going to focus
my talk on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers don't always know where
their commodities are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globalization could preclude the use of a
new pest control product, a new pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control product that may be very valuable
to an IPM program as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the use of any pesticide, and actually
what I've seen is even some of these newer
[SPEAKER_00]: products, we're actually seeing probably a
little bit higher residues from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got very short treatment,
the harvest interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them actually stay active in
the plant for a longer period of time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually seeing probably a little
more residues present in the plant than we
[SPEAKER_00]: did with the pyrethroids or the
organophosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of those are just kind of,
you go on, you make your application,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the compound would break down
fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the newer products don't break down
quite as quickly, but they're a lot safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so major market export flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the trade within the US,
Mexico, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of trade going back and
forth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have trade to Europe,
we have trade to Asia, Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand, South America trades with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring the trade up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we even find that we have trade
going, we may be shipping something out
[SPEAKER_00]: from one place, and then something else
comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very complicated now, the trade
paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that are
studying the citrus people, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our major trade markets that
we're going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: The companies that develop some of these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if I develop it for use on lettuce,
where do I need to make sure that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: trade MRLs established for those markets
that our growers are gonna use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just some other considerations is
it's not necessarily even that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, from my discussion with the
cranberry growers, they grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: cranberries in Maine, Massachusetts,
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll just ship them right
across the border just to get them juiced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wanna bring them back into
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's a pesticide residue on
them, they can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Canada didn't recognize that MRL
that was being used on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, in other cases,
it may be, it may be okay to export it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then grapes, we've seen a similar
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even grapes coming from Ontario into New
York, we've had some issues with some
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide residues appearing on the
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the maximum residue limits,
the pesticide residues can really preclude
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these shipments and really more
efficient and more use of the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available to the growers,
like the juicing plants and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend from the Northwest Hort
Council, he said, why do you always use
[SPEAKER_00]: apples?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the commodity that we've
decided to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the US, we may have a use pattern
and it results in a five part per million
[SPEAKER_00]: residue level on the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have in Canada, well,
maybe they don't need so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a lower MRL on the apples in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have, you go around the
world, there's different use patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some are used pre-bloom,
post-bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on where you are in the
world, you may have a different pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: residue limit on that commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine when you're trying to
trade your apples in the US that were
[SPEAKER_00]: treated and they could result in five
parts per million and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: export the other parts, the kind of issues
that you can run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the ideal world, then everybody
would have the same MRL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we want to get
with the harmonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of switch gears a
little bit, just talk about registration
[SPEAKER_00]: and how pesticides are regulated for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to come back to some of
the other trade issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the US, really EPA is the only body
that really regulates pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regulated under the Federal
Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just been a number of
amendments that have been made from year
[SPEAKER_00]: to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food Quality Protection Act actually
made amendments to the FIFRA Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the North American countries,
we have PMRA Pest Management Regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: Agency that regulates pesticides in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mexico, it's a little similar to
what we used to do here and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries do it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like a health department and
they have an ag department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they work together to regulate
the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then globally, we have the EU,
the European Commission, Korea,
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think probably what we'd like to see
is that all of these countries work under
[SPEAKER_00]: the Codex standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Codex is an ultimarius kind of a global
standard that's recognized in some
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, but not all countries as a
standard for pesticide residue limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really set standards, but they provide
guidance documents to the member countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the US, when you're going to submit
a pesticide, you have to generate data in
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a conventional product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about biopesticides and
microbials in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to generate data in all these
different areas before you can get your
[SPEAKER_00]: product registered in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your product properties,
fate, transport, environmental fate,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray drift, ecological effects,
chemistry, health effects, testing
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all your cancer studies that
you're doing with various test animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually going through changes now
where they're going to, they call it
[SPEAKER_00]: century 21 talks, and they're going to be
doing more in vitro testing instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: animal testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occupational residential exposure,
all these studies actually could cost
[SPEAKER_00]: probably up to, from when a company
decides to develop a product and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take it to the registration,
it's about $250 million worth of studies
[SPEAKER_00]: that they invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the more recent studies
that they were required, but most people
[SPEAKER_00]: use waivers in the past, but now they
actually have to generate data,
[SPEAKER_00]: but developmental neurotoxin and immunotox
studies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for some of our other areas,
like the microbial pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemicals, for the conventional
products, there's three divisions in EPA
[SPEAKER_00]: that review the data that comes in for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these products, they're independent
divisions that cover them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the biochemicals, in most cases,
you're going to get an exemption from an
[SPEAKER_00]: MRL, exemption from a tolerance,
but the division still has to review what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call a six pack of tox data just to
make sure that there's no toxological
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns with those biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then microbials, that's more of your
counter cleaners and items like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they don't have to go through
the extensive environmental fate and type
[SPEAKER_00]: of studies there, but they do have to do
more performance testing for the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about this already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our risk equation, and this is
the global definition of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hazard times exposure equals your
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hazards identified through all those
toxicity studies that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then exposure, you have some studies
that you conduct, but a lot of it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you model, obviously you can do
various aspects of the modeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to talk about some of the
refinements that you can do with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I mentioned earlier,
too, the reduced risk products are really
[SPEAKER_00]: lower hazard products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the products that are actually
being registered now, they can't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: find any toxin points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them, but there's some of them
that they really... And then FQPA,
[SPEAKER_00]: really all these items were looked at
separately, before FQPA, but now it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: put into the same risk cup under that
active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using something on your pet
and you're consuming peas and it's treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same thing, that's all part of
the risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using it around your house for
termite control, but then you got a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that's using it, it's still considered in
the risk cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these items used to be looked at
separately, but now they're looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: together under FQPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the maximum residue limits,
they're used for enforcement to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's proper application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's at the local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at, okay, if you're
exceeding your tolerance, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not using the product according to the
label that was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll use it for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's also used for standards for
commodities and trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also domestically as well as
internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's shipping something across
state lines, California, I think New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably have a monitoring program to
make sure that the pesticide residue
[SPEAKER_00]: limits are underneath those standards that
were set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum residue limit is only set if
the dietary exposure risk assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: confirms that there's no human health
concerns to any segment of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, kids are the biggest segment
probably that we're the most concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe women of the childbearing age is the
next segment of the population that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the EPA, as well as any regulatory
agency, they will not set an MRL unless
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no human health concerns to any
segment of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have every country has or
is developing their own regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are independent like the EPA
is independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them actually default to
Codex as a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the problems is with
commodities and trade is that not all
[SPEAKER_00]: countries recognize Codex as a global
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about risk again, we have a
risk endpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to mention here is that
the NOEL level is the no observable effect
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do your tox testing,
so you have different levels that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the reduced risk products and
the newer products are really no
[SPEAKER_00]: observable effect level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older products, there is a
lowest level of observable effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you ran your
studies, you could either have,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're below that level, you probably
would never seen anything in the studies
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that level, your no
observable effect level, then they
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically add a 10X intraspecies and
another 10X interspecies safety factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with FQPA, they also added another 10X
for kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your 10X from humans to dogs,
and then another 10X from within humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Robin and I, we may have difference in
our genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to add another 10X safety
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for kids, that's the risk
endpoint here that they're starting from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they register a new product,
most of the time they don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: refinements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of way out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the risk cup seems to be filling up
with no refinements, then they may look at
[SPEAKER_00]: refinements such as percent of crop
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, not all the crop may be treated
with the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tier three, they'll even take
the market data that's being generated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA and see what the values are that
they're finding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do these residue studies,
we're looking for what we call the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's three applications that we
think the grower may need, we'll put the
[SPEAKER_00]: three applications on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cucumbers, it's an insecticide,
it's probably going to be a one-day PHI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we harvest that sample as it's at
the farm gate with the one-day PHI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes out to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, when we do the regulatory
work, we're looking at really what the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm gate value is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the registration process, discoveries,
probably two to five years, regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: research, three to five years,
and then EPA review two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's being developed now is probably
really not going to be available to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers for another 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the issues we get when
we have our workshops, Robin, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: had our workshop a week ago to set what
our priorities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not doing a discovery or even
some of the long-term regulatory data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing a residue study,
and then we're submitting it to EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our timeline's about five years to
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you stack on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, you have the EPA
review, the Canadian review, EU review,
[SPEAKER_00]: Codex review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see that by the time a
commodity can actually use the product in
[SPEAKER_00]: trade, it can be quite long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these, there's a global joint
review process, and some of these are done
[SPEAKER_00]: concurrently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Codex always does it after the
review's been approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the international cooperation
in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the different regulatory
agencies that are working on harmonizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the MRLs that are in trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now just to comment about the global
joint review process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where several national authorities
work together to review an active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they receive the same submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop a joint schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They divide up the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the conclusion, they make
their own regulatory decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the hope is is that they end up
with similar endpoints, and the MRLs are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then trading's not impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, there's a lot of information on
here, but I really just want to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: this chlorine trantopril product that was
registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all the partners that
participated in the global joint review
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the US reviewed the
toxicology studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia reviewed the residue chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United Kingdom, the ecotox studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland, the environmental fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Canada reviewed the product
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see where it's less redundant,
and you're using your resources more
[SPEAKER_00]: wisely that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, the compound was submitted
in 2007, registered for joint review in
[SPEAKER_00]: the countries that participated in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's registered in over 100
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commodities that are treated with
that product don't really need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned when they're in trade channels,
if they're going to be detected as an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really becoming a way of doing
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I can mention is in the
EU, for example, they had a legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: change two years ago and made it very
difficult for them to participate in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they were kind of working along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was going fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a legislative change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they got to retool and then decide
how they can participate in this global
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the hope is with these joint
reviews is that we can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonization of the tools, harmonization
of the data evaluation records that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used in reviewing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those submissions, they're all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the US, if you're in the EU,
your review is going to look the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: any other country in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then hopefully the process will be
something that builds on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: More countries will participate in it,
more international organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing we hope is that the
minor uses or special uses will be
[SPEAKER_00]: dovetailed into those reviews as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower concerns, diminishing
reliance on codex MRLs or just the refusal
[SPEAKER_00]: to use codex as an international standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a growing backlog of reviews at
codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already have the new products
registered in the US, but we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for codex to review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can export to those countries
that respect the codex standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a proliferation of
country-specific MRLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we call a positive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Japan has a positive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Korea used to respect codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they want their own positive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: India used to respect codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they want their own positive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the product you use on your commodity
is on that positive list, you're OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the product you're using is not on
that list, then you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exporting to that country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing I'm going to talk
about a little later is just the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: standards with the food retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're even lower than the national
standards or pesticide use restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main challenges is a continued loss
of key protection products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually something I got from
a grower in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow salads, green crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he indicated is their loss of key
protection products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw here with the loss of the
organophosphate is the loss of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organophosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a more limited mechanism
of action for the products that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more pressure on resistance
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have resistance,
then obviously you're losing your
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're already seeing resistance
to the pyrethroids and other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they really need is effective
control with minimum residues to meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: demands of their customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another grower reality, growers need a
wide variety of pesticide tools to control
[SPEAKER_00]: their pests, but also to manage resistance
and integrate with the IPM programs and
[SPEAKER_00]: also with the greater demand on trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, it's really there's a
scarcity of MRLs that prevents trades and
[SPEAKER_00]: delays transition to the newer,
safer products.
And
[SPEAKER_00]: this one also focuses on the secondary
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have food retailers that set
arbitrary pesticide residue levels or
[SPEAKER_00]: limit specific pesticides that can be used
to convince their consumers that their
[SPEAKER_00]: food is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the growers are forced to manage
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no late season uses because
they're managing pesticide residue limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to mitigate the residue
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have loss of quality because
poor insect control and less residue leads
[SPEAKER_00]: to resistance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fewer pesticide cause resistance and
disrupts the IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing I'd like to add there,
too, is we developed these IPM programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have something like the brown
marmorated stink bug that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers are basically throwing
anything they can at the stink bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it completely destroys their IPM
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like they have to start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these trade standards also affect
their organic production as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We registered thymol for use in beehives
that control the tracheal mites in
[SPEAKER_00]: beehives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, it's an exemption from the
requirement of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the EU, it has an actual MRL value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an issue because we don't
regulate the residue level in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the EU does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinosad, it has MRLs in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be regulated as a
conventional product internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will require MRLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the biopesticides really,
they don't have MRLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're what's called an exemption from
the requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exemption from the requirement of
a tolerance in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of variability for
biopesticides across the world on how they
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them actually require certain
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, like the US, they're exempt
from tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do a safety finding on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary standards, it's a way in which
retailers try to respond to their consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: needs and their expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not really established
following any principles or guidelines
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually used as a rule of trade
between countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really kind of, I say ignore here,
but it really complicates all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other trade efforts that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have regulatory bodies working
together, trying to harmonize trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw another standard on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers just don't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use a product that they think is
going to be fine going to the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it gets there, if the
retailers reject it, it's a commodity
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily risk-based or
science-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't really take into account
special needs of developing countries
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because a lot of these
secondary standards slides that I used was
[SPEAKER_00]: from a colleague of mine that gave a
presentation on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really a market strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really arbitrarily setting the
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talked about setting the MRLs
earlier, I talked that the MRLs are set on
[SPEAKER_00]: what the use pattern is that the grower
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's determined to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the levels were higher or lower,
it would still meet the safety finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a secondary standard set and they
say, well, the MRL is 5, we want ours to
[SPEAKER_00]: be 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not really set on science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just set on what they think their
consumers want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, it can crowd out
smallholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be adding unnecessary costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it affects efficacy of the
product and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the growers, it really doesn't
mean a better price either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just close with a few closing
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global trade of ag products, it's
increased tremendously over the past five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in spite of the economic
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's kind of a look into the
future where the global population is
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really the bright spot of our
economy is really agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of an exciting place to
be right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of regulation of
pesticides, not only at the local level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the national and also international
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that is really to ensure consumer
safety from the get go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide residues do have a major impact
on trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really requires a significant
effort by the brokers, traders,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the growers to manage to make sure
that the trade continues to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing we really want to see
that trade continue to expand in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has been in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers are certainly impacted by the
pesticide residue limits and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects their pest control decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will some of the regulatory
cooperation agreements with Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a regulatory cooperation council
that was signed by Prime Minister Harper
[SPEAKER_00]: and President Obama.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to remove some of the regulatory
hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That impact trade, will that increase our
trade and harmonization?
[SPEAKER_00]: EU is also considering another type of
regulatory trade agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pacific Rim countries, there's also
discussions there about harmonizing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the regulatory barriers that impact
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continued movement to harmonization is
required to support expansions and should
[SPEAKER_00]: be considered as more countries are
developing new systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of each company reinventing the
wheel, we should all be working together
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we're really inventing the
same wheel or using the same wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to ask, what will the next
paradigm shift be in pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see what the Food Quality Protection
Act did to the products that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: used now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we get to a point where the MRLs
may be no longer required?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are exempt from tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the conventional products that
EPA's reviewed, they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing exemption from tolerance on
the products that they're registering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internationally, it's not respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have to generate residue data
if we're going to be exporting commodities
[SPEAKER_00]: abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I hope is that we can get to a
point where we have some harmonization and
[SPEAKER_00]: the new products that are developed really
won't require these trade barriers to
[SPEAKER_00]: impact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take any questions or comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
