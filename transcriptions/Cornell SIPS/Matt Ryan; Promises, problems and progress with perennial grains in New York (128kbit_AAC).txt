[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everyone coming out this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be talking about perennial
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit of a new area of research
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a whole lot of data to
show you, but I'm going to be telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're up to in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to share a little
negative information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my profile online for the section,
not the department, I have a research
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say what I'm interested in and cover
crops, as Tony was mentioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable cropping systems, ecological
weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have two words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say I'm interested in perennial
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I received more comments, students'
inquiries coming in from outside asking
[SPEAKER_00]: about those two words out of a 100-word
description of my research than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that I do, even though I'm not doing
a whole lot of work in this area quite
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you enjoy what I have to offer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just go through and tell you
what the take-home messages are first in
[SPEAKER_00]: case we don't get to the end of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that perennial grains are
becoming an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the longest time, people have just
talked about this as more of a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now it's becoming a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's increasing interest and
consumer demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have gotten wind of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that are seeking out
perennial grain products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are processors that are very
interested in getting their hands on this
[SPEAKER_00]: grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really exciting time to be working on
perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What fits into my research program and one
of the reasons why I'm very interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains is because they have a
potential to provide ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_00]: and increase the sustainability of
cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're thinking about perennial
grains, because this is a new type of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, the integration strategy is really
important and critical for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly how we go about growing these
crops, where on the landscape they're
[SPEAKER_00]: planted, and how they're managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with also being a new crop,
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand how these crops
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need some more information so that
we can share this information with farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide them with information on the
best management practices and ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go any further, I just want to
highlight some of the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this research at Cornell and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra Wayman, she's really, so in the
front here, she's been really leading the
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, keeping this project together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very happy to have her involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valentin Debray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Valentin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intern from France,
from Israel, Lyon, who came over this past
[SPEAKER_00]: summer and helped with some of the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene Law is a new graduate student right
here, working with Tony DiTomaso and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Steve Coleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Steve, having his arms up here,
saying, why aren't people growing more
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was actually from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an alum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came through the program here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Ohio State University now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really was my entryway into working
with perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's the one that really got me first
interested in this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Lee DeHaan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came and actually gave a seminar in
this section a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some of the updates of his
work at the land instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why focus on perennial grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thinking about why I'm really
interested in this, a lot of it has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember Mike Hoffman's
presentation earlier in the semester,
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change is a really big deal for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of challenges associated
with climate change in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see perennial grains as a way to
deal with some of those challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recent advances in crop breeding,
I think, are really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's opportunity for seeing some
pretty fast progress over the next several
[SPEAKER_00]: years with perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are starting to understand the
importance of ecosystem services and the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of how we manage our
landscapes, our agricultural landscapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can achieve not only food
production, but also some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental benefits that we get from
agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with ecosystem services, in 2005,
Jonathan Foley published this paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: Global Consequences of Land Use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really calling for an
integration of what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: natural ecosystems, where you have a lot
of ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this flower diagram, these are
represented up here from forest
[SPEAKER_00]: production, carbon sequestration,
a number of these on the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's quite a bit different from
intensive crop land, where the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do here is to
combine these two, so that we get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're seeing here with
this crop land with restored ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing perennial grains as an
opportunity to achieve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a paper published not too long
ago looking at the way that we can put
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're talking about
perennials in general, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains, but how we can place
these on the landscape to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were seeing is that with
just a small amount of perennials in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape, we can dramatically increase
the amount of ecosystem services that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're receiving from these agroecosystems
and also achieve crop production at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about why we're focused on
perennial cropping systems, perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grains, one of the reasons is because
there are challenges with annual cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a step back and you think
about annual cropping systems and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology of annual cropping systems,
we know that these are good in that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are highly productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a lot of food out of
annual cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they often require very large amounts
of external inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rich Smith came and gave a presentation
in this section several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a paper that came out looking
at agriculture, energy use, environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called into question annual
cropping systems and said that what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to do here is maintain this
perpetual state of secondary succession,
[SPEAKER_00]: of initial secondary succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing that with disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing that to increase resource
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in ecological terms, we're using these
inputs to make resources available for
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants that we want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the environmental impacts associated
with annual cropping systems is directly
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the energy that's required to
maintain that state of initial secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some more background information just
here to set the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at annual cropping systems,
here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there could be a lot of
evapotranspiration, or evaporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, a lot of runoff, especially if
you're on a sloped land like we have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photograph from 2015 at the
Musgrave Research Farm, seeing some real
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2015, in June, there was quite a
bit of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had about 8 inches of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where our long-term average is about 4 at
the research farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of you who do field research,
who are around this summer, we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: this past summer, 2016, it didn't look
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had less than 1 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing these dramatic swings in
environmental conditions, in rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to help farmers deal
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deal with some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to this diagram comparing
annual and perennial cropping systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple things that I want to point
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evaporation decreasing because we're
having more ground cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see a larger nutrient pool that
can be accessed by these roots that go
[SPEAKER_00]: down deeper with perennial grains compared
to annual grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less runoff and erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that's happening here,
if you look at the diagram of the suns
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we're using resources over an
extended period of time with perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grain cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where annuals you're planting in,
say, April, May, you're missing out on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those heat units that happen
before you plant your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing after you harvest your
crop in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with perennial grains, you're really
taking advantage of all the resources that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two main approaches for
developing perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to domesticate a wild crop,
or a wild perennial, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is to cross a crop,
an annual crop, with a perennial relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two main approaches for
developing perennial grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the breeders are really trying to
do is combine multiple desirable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at regrowth
perenniality is really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to get both of these
together into the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they should also be somewhat
tolerant to abiotic and biotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the goals for the plant
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big success stories is with
intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scientific name is Thinopyrum
Intermedium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called Kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the tray name that was developed
by the Land Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Lee DeHaan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the plant breeder at the Land
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been developing this particular
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was first identified in 1983 by
Peggy Wagner down at the Rodale Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it something different down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it Wild Triga.
[SPEAKER_00]: That name has not stuck where Kernza has
really taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant, this was identified out of
a screening that involved over 100 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that this one was the best
in terms of having these desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the grain looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a hole on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one issue that we've been
dealing with is trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this stuff clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really exciting is that we're
now seeing the first commercial production
[SPEAKER_00]: of this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Kansas, looking at combine
harvests of the Kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the grain looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the nicest picture of the
grain that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grain, the grain that we grew here in
New York, doesn't quite look as nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pass this around so you
can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really exciting is that the
first commercial product is now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Patagonia, the clothing company,
outdoor clothing company, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: started a new offshoot company,
new branch, called Patagonia Provisions
[SPEAKER_00]: that uses the same kind of model that they
use with their clothing company,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the clothing should be produced
sustainably, to start looking at food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the original plan was that
they were going to develop a granola bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they went with beer instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is long root ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a can of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eugene was kind enough to acquire some
of this beer, which was quite tasty when
[SPEAKER_00]: we tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really exciting, again,
because people have always talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past 20, 30 years, people have
talked about perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was no commercial production of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we are now at this point is just
really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, if you look at the fine print,
it says free ground shipping on orders
[SPEAKER_00]: over $75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we can't get it shipped to
New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't apply for the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the other products that they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in case anybody was interested in
ordering some long root ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another exciting thing happening with
Kernza is that there was recently a
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the front cover of this
proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was for General Mills,
the food company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks at the Land Institute have been
in contact with General Mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had requested a proposal to
support research on Kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're trying to do here is to
go back up the supply chain to try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that they can meet their
sustainability objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to the work that Dr.
Harrell Van Ness is doing with Walmart and
[SPEAKER_00]: using Adapt N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going up the supply chain to try to
figure out how to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability of their corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so General Mills aims to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 28% by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to achieve that goal,
they're looking to utilize 18 million
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of Kernza annually by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this proposal was developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're calling for here is the
development of the Kernza Development
[SPEAKER_00]: Consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like this last part here
that's funded by an aggressive investment
[SPEAKER_00]: in research over the next 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm part of this Kernza Development
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to see this moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll be doing a lot more
research on Kernza in the near future with
[SPEAKER_00]: help from General Mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the ecosystem services that
we're talking about with perennial grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about providing both food
and potentially forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not listed there, but carbon
sequestration, habitat for wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're growing these crops as
opposed to annual crops, we can reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage, reduce our soil erosion,
and reduce pollution from the inputs that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using to grow these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to highlight some of the past
work by Steve Coleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plots are out at KBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back a number of years ago,
I think in 2012, maybe 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Steve invited me out to KBS for part
of this perennial grains meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to tour some of his plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found in this research was
that Kernza yields were quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kernza is the perennial plant in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is annual wheat in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is perennial wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the perennial wheat here, this is the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crossing the annual crop with the
perennial relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kernza, on the other hand, is the
domesticated wild perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they saw that the yields were quite
low with Kernza, especially in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They planted a bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an establishment year, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got up to about a third of annual
wheat in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also found that Kernza reduced
nitrogen losses and also had lower
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture deeper in the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not summary results for
perennial wheat, because the perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat did not fare so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the grain yields were higher in
the first year, it did not persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it died off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the perenniality is a really big issue
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this one, good yields, but it did not
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at some of these data,
we're looking at soil moisture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 0 to 20 centimeters,
20 to 40, 40 to 70, and 70 to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing here is that the
perennial grain, and this is in case
[SPEAKER_00]: Kernza compared to annual wheat,
so it's drying out the soil more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's utilizing soil moisture to a
greater degree than the annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly in year one over here,
2010, and then in 2011, it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced as you go deeper in the soil
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at nitrate leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they installed lysimeters in these
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at three different
types of nitrogen source, so high
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, a middle rate of 80 pounds of
nitrogen per acre as urea, and then an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic source of nitrogen, so another 80
pounds as poultry litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're seeing here, again,
the perennial grain Kernza is the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing virtually no leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Kernza, those deep roots,
you can see here, they're really sucking
[SPEAKER_00]: up that nitrogen, that nitrate,
and preventing it from leaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're talking about,
reducing pollution associated with these
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs that we're using to grow our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of interest in using
perennial crops like Kernza to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: soil carbon sequestration and as a tool
for climate change mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lab, I've been working on a review
paper for the past year, more than a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at different cropping
systems, specific cropping strategies for
[SPEAKER_00]: working with perennial grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is using perennial rye,
which I'll talk about in a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to perennial wheat,
where it's a cross between the annual crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and the perennial relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intermediate wheatgrass combined with a
perennial legume forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one here, this highly
diverse perennial grain polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we just start with that one,
this is really what Wes Jackson was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking when he does a lot of his talks
about perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this strategy, we're really trying to
mimic nature, having all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different species growing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is supposed to simulate what we're
seeing in the prairies, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: different species and they self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine that you can have
quite a bit of ecosystem services coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from a situation like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are not actively working on
developing this type of system,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because of the complexity
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this graphic here,
just this example, if we look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of crop species that we're
including in a mixture or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: polyculture, you can imagine that the
ecosystem services, if you follow this
[SPEAKER_00]: line here, they increase with the number
of crop species that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hit an asymptote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the management complexity also
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not exactly sure what this
relationship looks like in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: management complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot different than the shape
of the curve that I just drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know it increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're thinking about is, how can we
do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we be smart about putting these
species together so that we can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: our ecosystem services, actually achieve a
higher level of ecosystem services?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we're getting up to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we're only getting up to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also change and make sure that
we're being strategic about our species
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're including so that the
management complexity is also reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are strategic about it,
we think that there is potential here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the main concern here is with
this management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complexity and just being able to grow
these crops together in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does seem like we can get some
traction with is with perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this crop as part of a,
at least thinking about it as part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation where we have it in a rotation
with annual crops where we can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil health over several years and
then rotate back to annual crops to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of that increased soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I already talked a little bit
about this being a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: These yields have been a bit higher than
current, at least in the past with
[SPEAKER_00]: previous research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the title of the presentation,
it promises the problems and the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want you to focus on the
progress, of course, but there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that we need to acknowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the problems with ergate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ergate is a fungal disease and it can be
pretty bad in terms of the impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: health impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's causes, creates psychoactive
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we really want to
avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started thinking about
perennial rye, I thought we could use this
[SPEAKER_00]: for distilling to support the distilling
industry around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that ergate, the
alkaloids will actually go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: distilling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really isn't going to be a
viable way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at color separation for
dealing with any ergate issues that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this option, including intermediate
wheatgrass with the perennial forage,
[SPEAKER_00]: this does seem like one of the most
tractable ways to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of progress with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in combining these two
different types of crops because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the legume to supply nitrogen
to the kernza and also increase the forage
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're thinking about dual purpose use
of kernza, harvesting it both for grain
[SPEAKER_00]: and for forage, having a legume forage in
there would certainly be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are intercropping,
one of the challenges, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with perennials,
is the managing competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the time of establishment,
if you're planting them at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're trying to put in the legume
later, you can have one species easily out
[SPEAKER_00]: compete the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're taking an active look at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new experiment that Eugene Law
will be helping with managing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just established this past
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is comparing two annual grains
to two perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them have this split plot with
red clover, so with and without red
[SPEAKER_00]: clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this will be a three year
experiment where the annuals are
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a worst case scenario to really
look at what happens if you do something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not supposed to do,
but comparing that to these perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypotheses are that soil health
will be greater and pests will be lower in
[SPEAKER_00]: plots with perennial grains compared to
plots with annual grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that red clover will increase grain
yields and overall profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of our measurements,
we're looking at crop performance
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators, biomass grain yield,
and also pests, grain quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health indicators, and soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another factor that we're really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the plots of the plants look
like 28 days after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cernza over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photographs aren't the best,
but this is 55 days after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cernza plots, there is some green
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a lot of soil right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being a perennial, this crop is just
much, much slower than these annuals over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with these varieties by working
with some local farmers that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are popular varieties with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully they'll be interested in
our results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is what the perennial rye
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit better than the Cernza,
but not quite as good as those annual
[SPEAKER_00]: small grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a new experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you about an experiment
that we have been working on over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was established in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with Steve Coleman,
this dual-purpose Cernza experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really one of the reasons why
we're interested in conducting the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with Eugene, looking at
combining the red clover with the Cernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because we're thinking that
Cernza can be used for not only grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for forage production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the grain yields have traditionally
been very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the grain yields typically
peak at years one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decline because of the plant being
sod-bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is highly rhizomatous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it forms a sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sod, that limits really the
reproductive tillering density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very problematic in terms of
maintaining grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve has done some work looking at
fertilizer applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Cernza does respond to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like many small grains, if you apply
too much, it can fall over and result in
[SPEAKER_00]: lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are goals and the objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions that we're asking is,
can we offset the low grain production
[SPEAKER_00]: with added value of forage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to look at both grain
and forage yields over a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how can we mitigate the declining
grain yields over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the effect of defoliation
on grain yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these slides, or some of this
information, was recently presented at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tri-Society meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the different locations
where this research is being conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here at number five here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see we're all over the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado, Kansas, Maryland,
Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Iowa,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, South Dakota, and even in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make a note that 30% of the
people here are from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come through Cornell program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certainly a Cornell connection
with these different researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's perpetuated by Steve
Coleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just knowing these folks, but
interested nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with these different treatments in
this experiment, there are four different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a control, this grain treatment,
where we're just harvesting the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a forage and grain, and then a
fall cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go through this, I really just want
you to pay attention to these two,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grain and then the forage and grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically the standard
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is trying to get some forage
from these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, and then harvesting for
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some nitrogen treatments,
using urea, applying at two different
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, using a split application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have some photographs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the spring growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was planted in August of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is overwintered in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is harvesting with the very old
Carter harvester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Brian Caldwell, one of the
folks that's in my lab, harvesting on May
[SPEAKER_00]: 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the plots look like after
they were harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut to a height of four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems that we had with
starting off this experiment was that we
[SPEAKER_00]: went into a field that had previously been
planted to annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was thinking that this was a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that there was a lot of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the annual wheat wasn't collected
in the combining process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was distributed across the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were a lot of annual wheat
heads mixed in with the kernza,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least during the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the research plots, we had quite an
amazing crew of undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undergraduate research assistants who went
out and handpicked a lot of the annual
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they almost killed me for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helped clean things up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of our plot combine
going through the research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge that we had with this
crop, with harvesting it, was direct
[SPEAKER_00]: combining.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the research plot combine,
we did have a lot of clogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the material wasn't completely
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is with perennial grains,
so they're drying from the top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: An annual grain will dry from the bottom
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have to dry, you don't
have to deal with wet material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through with your combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the cutter bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passes through the combine without any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the lower you go, the greener it
gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a bit of an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we learned a lot over the
past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was using the farm combine that has
an air reel up at front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a lot easier to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had a greater capacity to get the
material through the combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fairly dirty, our first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of extra material in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of annual wheat, despite the
hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we weren't all that thrilled about
our first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the plots that had
nitrogen applied to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the extra green that you see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the urea was applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have a whole lot of impacts
on the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see greater forage biomass
production from the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in the fall, but no effect on the
grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the plots post-anthesis in July
this past year in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to show you grain yields
across all nine sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just box plots going from
Colorado all the way on the left to
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin here in the two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So average across all the sites,
grain yields were a bit higher in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to 2015, compared to 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I encourage you not to think about
this in comparison to annual grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that'll just maybe be a little
depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting grain off of these
perennial plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the main takeaway point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a low yield, but it's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at just New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the two treatments that I
asked you to pay attention to in the two
[SPEAKER_00]: different years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at basically the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the forage at the time of grain
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plots over here, they had this
spring cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we went in when it was
still very green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested these plots for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went back and we harvested
them for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the straw yields
associated with that grain harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no real difference overall in terms of
overall biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is quite a bit different material
than this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the forage quality of the
spring cut, so the green material compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the summer cut, we see that there are
some pretty big differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of what we're
shooting for with our forage quality
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crude protein, in this case,
it was higher associated with the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, there's probably
some grain that's going into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's driving up that straw protein
value at the summer cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the relative feed value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good relative feed value is above
150.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're up to 214 with that early cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really excited about these
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that Kernza can make some very nice
forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next question is, well,
does that forage clip really impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: grain yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so although not statistically
different, our first year, we did see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the forage harvest, we did see a
numerically lower yield than just
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting the grain alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it wasn't all that
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we did see that same negative effect
when we take the forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a lower grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the other cases, again,
no impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not all the same site years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other sites did not have this
exact treatment or did not manage it the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a reduced set of those
different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the dual purpose Kernza
experiment, so yields varied widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that in terms of the control
treatment, we didn't talk a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: control treatment, but that's basically
just harvesting the grain versus going in
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking out the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take out the straw, we see some
higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I think is actually happening
there is when you mow those pots after you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, you're actually getting some weed
control associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have some perennial weeds that
crept into the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so reducing that biomass, that
standing biomass, was beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring clipping reduced plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of the lodging problem,
we think that that can help, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to be adding nitrogen to try
to increase our crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really excited about this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shift gears a little bit and
tell you about some other research that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted a survey of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to really know what's going
on with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they heard about perennial grains
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they interested in potentially growing
perennial grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a survey of farmers and
also processors who are still working on
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzing the processor data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to gauge interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was conducted in France and in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some collaborators,
Christophe David at Isra Leon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was Valentine's project over the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a fairly decent response rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 400 farmers responded to the
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot more in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could have probably done a
better job getting the word out in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a decent response rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a decent response, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used snowball sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't actually calculate a response
rate because we don't know how many people
[SPEAKER_00]: saw the survey link.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were happy to get this many people
responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to show you a couple of the
results from this survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at motivations for
growing perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the number one motivation,
and we have it broken out by organic and
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the demographics of the
pool of respondents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that there was a nice split
between organic and conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was somewhat intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to have a lot of organic
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that this first one here,
increasing or maintaining farm
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the number one reason why
farmers would be interested in growing
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: More conventional farmers than organic
farmers were interested in that factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conventional farmers, again,
wanted to try to reduce their inputs using
[SPEAKER_00]: this perennial grain compared to an annual
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the organic farmers were
more interested in reducing labor than the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we see here,
diversifying crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a big difference between the
organic and conventional farmers with the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farmers thinking that perennial
grains can help them diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the organic farmers that we
surveyed grew forage crops and had
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this made sense to us that more of the
organic farmers would be interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: using perennial grains for that dual
purpose of both grain and forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also asked about concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potential reasons why they might not
grow perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we see here is increased pest
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more organic farmers than conventional
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both types of farmers were interested in
or concerned about the low grain yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: high seed costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lack of market where you can sell
your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional farmers were more concerned
about low profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was interesting that in
terms of low grain yield and low
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability, the organic farmers,
they weren't as concerned about low
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability as the conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll stop there with that
survey graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some targeted questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some very specific questions
that we wanted to get them to respond to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were asked to agree or disagree
with the statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is, I'm interested in
dual purpose perennial grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial crops that can be harvested for
both grain and forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more organic farmers agreed with that
statement than conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 148 compared to only 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the percentage,
so about 70% compared to about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next statement, I would grow
perennial grains to provide environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, even if they were not as
profitable as other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, organic farmers tended to agree
with that much more than conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here is, research funding
should be spent on annual grain crops
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than developing new perennial grain
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pleased to see that there was a
lot of disagreement with that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there was a difference between
organic and conventional farmers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the organic farmers disagreed with
that statement compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see farmer interest in perennial
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot more that can be done
with that survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being worked up right now and
should be submitted to a journal very
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to tell you about a new
grant from Northeast SARE.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's titled Developing Perennial Grain
Cropping Systems and Market Opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have quite an ambitious performance
target with this grant proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said that 20 farmers will establish
perennial grains on a total of 400 acres,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to contribute to the sale of
150 tons of perennial grains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back at this, I feel a little
crazy for thinking that we could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I'm optimistic is
because of our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an outstanding group of organic
farmers working on this project and an
[SPEAKER_00]: outstanding project manager, Sandra
Wayman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people are very committed to
seeing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some on-farm trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new experiment at Musgrave,
the one I was telling you about with
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to be doing workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tasting event that's lined up,
and then with bakers and brewers and
[SPEAKER_00]: distillers, and also an on-farm field day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our farmers that are involved
in this project, looking at the plots over
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're going to be doing is
looking at Kernza and then perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crops were planted this past
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of the different farmers are
taking on a different research question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tor Aschner is looking at different
ways to harvest the material, the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Meyer is looking at spring fertility
and fertilizer rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Claus Martens is looking at
seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these questions were really
farmer-generated, which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they'll be more excited about the
results than if we were just to impose
[SPEAKER_00]: what we wanted to do onto their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is Tor Aschner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted at his place.
[SPEAKER_00]: On September 9, we were very interested in
working with Tor for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of those reasons was that in June
of 2015, he had an incredible rain event
[SPEAKER_00]: at his farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was the wet year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had five inches of rain in one hour and
washed away a lot of his soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's an organic farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses a lot of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's really interested in ways to
reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hopeful that we can integrate
perennial grains into his operation in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to help him deal with some of that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a version that he's
experienced in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stated in his letter of support that
Wes Jackson, some of his writings,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually inspired him to transition from
conventional production to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has experience harvesting different
crops, somewhat unique or alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he harvests buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat is a crop that he swaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he cuts it and then picks it up off the
ground and puts it through a combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also red clover for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's also a part owner of a flour mill
and a bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, he's vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that there could be a lot of
opportunities to work with Tor to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: market be developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One month after planting, the kernza looks
really weedy, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the perennial rye looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's John Meyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his plots were planted on September 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been a longtime collaborator with
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John Meyer really pays attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some research with him this past
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some soil testing and some weed
seed bank sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave him some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called us out on an issue that we
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you know, that doesn't look
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went back and we checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's really engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also the owner of a distillery right
along Kuga Lake on the west side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're thinking that we can work
with him to really try using some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains for distilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what his plots looked like 41
days after planting, the perennial rye
[SPEAKER_00]: looking a little bit better than the
kernza at this early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Claus Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people know Claus Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a seed and feed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lakeview Organic Grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a long history of collaboration
with Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are pictures of his plots 35 days
after planting, both the kernza and the
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to give you a sense for what
the farmers are thinking at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this project, here are some
early thoughts, some feedback they passed
[SPEAKER_00]: along to Sandra Wayman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tor, he says he's excited about kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: He heard about it years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But skeptical of the pathetic looking
kernza plants coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know Tor, he doesn't pull
any punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's joking around a little
bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's interested to see how it does on
his somewhat poor soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Meyer, he's quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he's curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far he hasn't had a lot of feedback to
share with us yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claus Martin's on the other hand,
he's very outspoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is very concerned about the small seed
size with kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has lots of ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever we go and visit with Claus
Martin, he has a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: research ideas that he wants us to start
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has ideas for the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he compares it to emmer and thinks that
forage is going to be critical for making
[SPEAKER_00]: this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting close to the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to highlight, we've talked a
lot about the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want people to understand that
there are also some drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving forward with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are very well aware of some of the
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in true holiday spirit with the red and
green, I have the drawbacks listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perennial grains are not going to
address these food security needs and
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that we often talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly lower yields than our annual
counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, one of the reasons why we're
working with Tor is because he's very in
[SPEAKER_00]: tune with grain quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has quality thresholds that he needs to
meet with his grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are going to be working with him
to try to figure out where kernza and
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial rye fit in, what can be done
with them in terms of processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is potential for pests to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop rotation in annual cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best cultural practice for managing pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're not doing that in
perennial grain cropping systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's potential for these pests to build
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you're at, if you're
using aquifers and irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains might be an issue because
of the water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Northeast, we don't really see this
being a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we have more water than
what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on where you're at in the
West, that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we covered a lot just to reiterate the
take-home messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perennial grains are becoming an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's increasing interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: The integration strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you are using polycultures,
putting the complementary species together
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you put it on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of taking your prime ag land that
you're growing annual grain crops in,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps putting them on sloped land or
using contour strips, there may be ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can integrate perennial grains in
a very meaningful way without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves into too much trouble in terms
of having these low yields and decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for agronomists in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need more people working on
perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to come up with best management
practices and be able to provide farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: with information that they need to
optimize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to say thanks for people
who have contributed to this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who have contributed seed,
helped out with the field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are several people on here
that are working on the review paper with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
