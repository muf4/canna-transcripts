[SPEAKER_00]: So first, why breed cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Cover Crop Breeding Network first
started doing its work back in 2015-2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: we carried out a survey of a little over
400 farmers and asked which traits they
[SPEAKER_00]: felt were important for each of the crops
we planned on working on, so over winter
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most commonly mentioned trait was
nitrogen fixation, which we've
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated and found correlates quite
highly with biomass accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomass is a goal in and of itself,
because in combination with early vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps with weed competition and all
those soil health benefits that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: having a big mass of biomass to decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter hardiness is a big goal,
obviously, because without that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get any of those benefits of
biomass in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't ask on this survey,
but we also know that breeding for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: yield can help bring seed costs down and
make cover cropping a reasonable economic
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all of our crops, we're breeding for
biomass, vigor, winter survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some crop-specific goals,
and we'll talk specifically about cold
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance and winter pea today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the three legumes and rye,
we start with breeding nurseries like
[SPEAKER_00]: these, where we can note and select single
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crimson clover, hairy vetch,
and rye are out-crossing species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nurseries start with 1,000 to 1,500
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select 5% or 10% of those, and all the
plants left in the nursery share pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: with one another, and we end up with one
population coming out of that nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, winter pea is a self-thin
crop, which means it doesn't naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: share pollen with its neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to create genetic diversity,
we have to cross the pollen from one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to the stigma right here, the sticky
stigma, the female reproductive part of
[SPEAKER_00]: another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with segregating populations
from this two plant cross, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: select, usually, individuals to increase
and advance to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these crops, once we select
good-looking things in nurseries,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step is advanced line trials in
multiple locations nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plots look a lot like the ones
that you have on your farm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a 15-foot row of the focus
crop, in our case, winter peas,
[SPEAKER_00]: flanked by triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this to simulate the competition
that the legume would have in a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That legume-grass mix is commonly used,
and we know that survival is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: better with the protection and
snow-holding ability of the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the legumes in the cover crop
breeding network, we have about six years
[SPEAKER_00]: of data, which has allowed us to make some
pretty robust conclusions about how these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines do over space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we're adding national cover
crop variety trials, which are plot-sized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are four-and-a-half-foot wide
plots by 20 feet, with five varieties per
[SPEAKER_00]: species replicated across 12 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the iterations we have at
Freeville, New York, our research farm
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows a next-size larger plot to
compare the best of the best across time
[SPEAKER_00]: and place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to sum up, there are two sides of our
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got germplasm sourcing, germplasm
development, then selection in breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries, then advanced line trials,
the 15-foot rows that we run in several
[SPEAKER_00]: locations across the country, then these
larger plots Concurrently, we have seed
[SPEAKER_00]: yield trials on smaller plots and then
larger plots so that we can make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we weed out lines with poor seed yield or
put more focus on lines with fully
[SPEAKER_00]: promising seed yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we get to release and
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all come in right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the on-prem trials are meant to
supplement the knowledge we are gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: from our band-fine trials, because even if
they're in a dozen locations across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, that's only a dozen, and you guys
are 69 locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge advantage to be able to
look at a trait-like winter survival,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ultimately is a yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of nuance in there,
but it gives us a lot more nuanced
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on where and how these things
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our original goal, and still our goal
with these trials, is to have you all
[SPEAKER_00]: trial cover crop breeding network
experimental material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some issues with seed availability
up until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started this year with commercial
material to get our methods down,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But starting this fall, we should be able
to let you trial some CCB material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the good part is that if you
find something you really like out of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, you can go buy it for your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an analysis based on six years
of advance line trial data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the number of times each thing
was trialed right here in the observations
[SPEAKER_00]: column.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got quite a bit of data,
so 25 different environments for this
[SPEAKER_00]: first entry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compare everything to the best check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our trials, which for us is why a
winter for the balance of traits that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think are beneficial for cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see quite a bit of progress for fall
bigger and spring bigger and biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things that are
better, that are as good or better for
[SPEAKER_00]: those three traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a ton of progress in winter survival,
although we have comparable winter
[SPEAKER_00]: survival for the best to why a winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, this is an index that I make to
be able to balance, to weight the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that are most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say more about that if it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing to say is that a couple of
these with the stars, we're hoping to make
[SPEAKER_00]: available for release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top one, this was selected Mark
Dudla's farm who was on the call with us
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark, I would love to talk more if
you're able to hang on about some details
[SPEAKER_00]: about that because it's really shown
excellent performance across time and
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exciting to see that there is
progress to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the lines, the three of the four
lines you have in your trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why a winter is a best check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been trialed in five seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of data on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survivors also look really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more compact of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little later to flower,
but it's done really nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have two years of data so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know it's a good looking,
pretty reliable variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blaze, some of you have is a semi-leafless
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't put on as much biomass because
the type of P it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that, but it has
great winter survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are places that Blaze survives
that the others don't, we know that those
[SPEAKER_00]: are really key places to target for
studying and selecting for winter
[SPEAKER_00]: survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plots are small scale plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have accommodated a lot of,
I guess this is good for home gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: for bench farmers, who are growing on beds
already, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 69 participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 43 of you have submitted results,
which is honestly a pretty good ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we were hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll give us a really great baseline
of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously are using the seedling
platform where you are collecting data on
[SPEAKER_00]: apps like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have interactive results like this,
which I'll share with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken data once in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take it twice in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a rubric to make sure that
each of us are generally having each
[SPEAKER_00]: number of the rating scale mean
approximately the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are photos from Reed's farm,
mapping the trial out, planting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you all found for winter
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you found for germination and
emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination, I guess the trade is called
germination in seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really measuring emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're measuring what we can see coming out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 28 to 34 reviewers per variety,
and everything was in the three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally better than 75% emergence,
which is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blaze did a little more poorly,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the lines tested at 93% germ or
above before we sent them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fall vigor, same general trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was at least acceptable at a
three, with canadigua and survivor moving
[SPEAKER_00]: towards strong growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this difference you're
noticing owes to the leaf type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a gene, there are three genes
in P that control leaf and tendril
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Varieties like Blaze that are
semi-leafless have two or sets of copies
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Ophelia gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will put on tendrils where their
terminal leaves would otherwise be.
[SPEAKER_00]: For grain production, this type is really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these types stand up, kind of hold
hands, and they are much easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't lodge as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the green peas produced now are
these semi-leafless types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we put Blaze in because
of its exceptional winter hardiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily because of its biomass,
but I'm also really curious if any of you
[SPEAKER_00]: like that type better for manageability
reasons or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other three varieties are normal
leafy types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are more indeterminate in vining,
and they're the pea plants you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: more used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a few things in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just check that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hello, Glenn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the next thing we asked you to rate
was flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we coordinated with our friends at Blue
Hill at Stonebarns to think about tasting
[SPEAKER_00]: peas, since peas are unique in that they
can be both a functional cover crop and a
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty pea shoot, or tallow greens crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll chat afterwards about how many of
you evaluated flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 15 to 19 reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: For variety, we got for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, we got in the range of I'd
eat it again, but I wouldn't seek it out
[SPEAKER_00]: to happily eat again for a survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the comments that some of
you left, it's really all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of environmental
factors that can influence how or what
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor compounds come out in pea or in any
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a survivor, across space this fall,
we got everything from very bitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: overpowers any sweetness to really good
green pea flavor to very sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: very pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a similar assortment of ratings for
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's just I think one of my
favorite things about studying flavor is
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no objectively good or bad
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different ones of us have different
assortments of taste buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have different experiences
associated with foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very same food can legitimately
taste or have an overall experience more
[SPEAKER_00]: positive or negative, even if it's grown
in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw in the variables of
where is it grown, how much moisture is it
[SPEAKER_00]: had, how much heat is it had, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the same variety can taste a lot
of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is interesting to see if we can
find trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about winter hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in our advanced line trials,
we talk about winter survival as just a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of the spring stand to the fall
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what percent of what came up in the
fall was there in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a blunt instrument,
but it's pretty relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly lets us differentiate
among varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: As all of you know, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Reed, for the props to Miko.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter is complex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also snow cover, wind, soil moisture,
and then the rate of change between
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures and snow cover and
no snow cover, and certainly ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more than just cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about temperatures
specifically, acclimation is the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant biochemical adaptation to
cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then deacclimation is the reversal of
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're thinking about things that
we want to keep some cold hardiness when
[SPEAKER_00]: we have more temperature fluctuations,
it gets really cold, but then we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: warm days and it gets really cold again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we are hoping to
be able to select for just by selecting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions of a change in cold
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes a pea winter hardy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a gene called the HR gene that
confers high sensitivity to day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pea stays in its vegetative stage
where it's putting on leafy biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not putting on flowers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the vegetative stage, it is less
sensitive to cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by delaying flowering until those
longer days, in the spring, that gives it
[SPEAKER_00]: a critical mass of cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold hardy peas also have a higher
photosynthetic rate and they accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: more sugars, which you can taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's finding peas with first of all,
that capacity to have that higher
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate and to make more
sugars and then to have those functions
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulated when the temperatures drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is variation in those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do we have the capacity genetically
and then does that capacity get dialed up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right rate when temperatures get
cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to probably high school
chemistry that we did, when we put solutes
[SPEAKER_00]: in water, it will raise the boiling point
and lower the freezing point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's lowering that freezing point that
we're interested in here and preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell tissues from drying out,
[SPEAKER_00]: from losing that osmotic balance between
different parts of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increases more anti-accidents are
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell wall composition is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly a lot of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty complex, but that's in general
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from our advanced line trials that
there's kind of this sweet spot where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, we don't have complete winter death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have complete winter survival
because neither of those scenarios tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: much or are much good for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we can't tell which varieties are
any worse or better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we've strategically placed
on farmers series like the one at Mark's
[SPEAKER_00]: Place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten some really nice
selections out of those environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our collaborators in Minnesota is
doing some growth chamber work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subjecting pea plants to a cold
acclimation, then a sub-zero acclimation,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a freeze drop and then a recovery and
seeing how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anywhere from not being damaged at all
after that recovery to being completely
[SPEAKER_00]: dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's found that, okay, so this is the
generation of selection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the F3 families and the next generation
that he selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first generation, there were
many families with complete death or a
[SPEAKER_00]: high proportion of complete death and very
few families with no damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in just the generation,
he's got a lot more families.
[SPEAKER_00]: that have no damage and fewer that have
complete damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in these scores,
keeping in mind that lower is better,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's moving the needle on a freeze
tolerance with this growth chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some similar work here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our grad students has a growth
chamber or freeze chamber protocol of her
[SPEAKER_00]: own seeking to both identify or refine
previously identified genomic loci or QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: that have to do with cold tolerance in
pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those genetic loci would drive
those biochemical mechanisms that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So future opportunities, things that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do on-farm trials with some
CCB network varieties starting this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd love to have as many of you as are
able participate in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Etienne, who may be still on the
phone, is running some interesting on-farm
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluations of existing cover crops that
you're going to plant anyway, and or a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety trial of commercial varieties that
will correspond with our national cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop variety trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch this space, meaning the seedling
feed and the emails that I send to you for
[SPEAKER_00]: more details on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also would really love to do some
on-farm breeding with some new materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: some crosses that I've made, variable
populations descending from those crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and have those selected in a lot of your
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's still pending funding,
but fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, for those of you who are even
remotely of our vicinity, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a cover crop and soil health field
day on April 24, which is a Thursday in
[SPEAKER_00]: the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our breeding material in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York Soil Health Group will have
their trailer there to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations about cover crop,
water infiltration, and all manner of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have various demos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd really love to have you join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Thank you.
