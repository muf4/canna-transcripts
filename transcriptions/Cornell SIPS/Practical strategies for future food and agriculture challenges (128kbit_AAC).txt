[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to let you know, the reason I don't
use PowerPoints is so many of my
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues have been telling me that when
I use them, they just get in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a couple of places where
PowerPoints would be useful, but you all
[SPEAKER_03]: have good imagination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll work on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just start with, I want to share
with you what one of my major concerns are
[SPEAKER_03]: now as we think about the future in food
and agriculture issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you probably gathered from the
introduction, I've been involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable agriculture now for 40 years
of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during that whole time, and even today
still, most of my colleagues who are
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged in sustainable agriculture are
thinking about it in terms of how do we
[SPEAKER_03]: make the current system a little less bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether you're into sustainability,
thinking about that in terms of simply
[SPEAKER_03]: intensifying what we're currently doing
more, which is, of course, one school of
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability, or if you're feeling that
everybody should go organic, or if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling that what we really need to do is
become more environmentally sound,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, it's still all operating under
the notion that the basic system we have
[SPEAKER_03]: out there, the modern industrial system,
is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to fix it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my point of view is that as we really
think about sustainability, we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about future challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that approach to sustainability is not
going to work for reasons that I'll go
[SPEAKER_03]: into in some detail in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the resources that also helped
me really think about this and this kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of transition that we need to think about
is the World Watch Institute now publishes
[SPEAKER_03]: a State of the World Report every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in each of they choose a different
theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the State of the World Report in 2013
was entitled, Is Sustainability Still
[SPEAKER_03]: Possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lead essay, the lead chapter in
that collection of essays, and the
[SPEAKER_03]: collection of essays, in my view,
are always really quite good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's usually a diversity of group of
people that contribute to each of these
[SPEAKER_03]: annual reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the essays in that report were
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the lead essay was written by Robert
Eagleton, who at that time was the
[SPEAKER_03]: president of the World Watch Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he coined the phrase for his lead
essay, Sustain a Babble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the title of the essay was Beyond
Sustain a Babble.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get beyond sustain a babble?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always thought that was a really
good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to frame this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he pointed out that we now have
all of these different views of
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability, which he says it reflects
a cacophonous profusion of the uses of the
[SPEAKER_03]: word sustainable to mean anything from
environmentally good to cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he points out that this is an approach
which has a high cost because frequent and
[SPEAKER_03]: inappropriate use lulls us into dreamy
belief that all of us and everything we do
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything we buy and everything we
use aren't able to go on forever without
[SPEAKER_03]: end amen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a really good statement
about where we are today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this state of dreamy belief is what
we have to get beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to really address some of the
key issues that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that has helped me a
lot to frame this is how do we now begin
[SPEAKER_03]: to think about sustainability in a more
appropriate, defensible way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the resources that's been
helpful to me in thinking about this is an
[SPEAKER_03]: anthropologist who published a book back
in 1989 by the name of Ernest Shusky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the title of the book that he
published is called Culture and
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture, an Ecological Introduction to
Traditional and Modern Farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you would expect from an
anthropologist, what he does is ask the
[SPEAKER_03]: questions, how have we as humans fed
ourselves ever since we've been on the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's where a PowerPoint slide would
be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually have one, but gearing
everything up for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all have good imagination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'd like to have you think about
now is the timeline of human history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you see the timeline of human
history all the way across the screen
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shusky points out that as full-fledged
human beings, we evolved on the planet
[SPEAKER_03]: about 200,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you can take it farther back than
that if you want to go back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Neanderthals, et cetera, a million years,
a million and a half years, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to think about it in terms
of when we were, what we see ourselves as
[SPEAKER_03]: today as full-blown human beings,
about 200,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he points out that for the first
200,000 years, or the first 190,000 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: we fed ourselves as hunter-gatherers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think of this timeline of human
history, you have to go at least about
[SPEAKER_03]: halfway or a little better than halfway
across the screen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we fed ourselves as hunter-gatherers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he points out that feeding ourselves
as hunter-gatherers was the most efficient
[SPEAKER_03]: energy system, food system we ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we were producing about 20
kilocalories of food for every one
[SPEAKER_03]: kilocalorie of the energy that we invested
in making that food available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then about 10 or 12,000 years ago,
the neolithic revolution started in which
[SPEAKER_03]: we started to do agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then instead of simply going out into
nature and hunting and gathering what
[SPEAKER_03]: nature provided to feed ourselves,
we started to manipulate nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started to do cultivation, we started
to domesticate plants and animals,
[SPEAKER_03]: and started to feed ourselves from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as he points out, this was a very
land-intensive kind of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we relied, first of all,
on the natural fertility in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in addition to that, we primarily
did the, and this is not every kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, but the majority of
agriculture was the slash and burn
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we would cut down and burn the
perennial plants that were out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the ash from that, plus the
natural fertility, would provide fertile
[SPEAKER_03]: environments in which to grow our food for
two or three or four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we would abandon that and slash
and burn another place and raise our food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he argues that from an energy
efficiency point of view, this was much
[SPEAKER_03]: less efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were now only getting about 10
kilocalories of food for every kilocalorie
[SPEAKER_03]: of energy that we invested.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think of the timeline of human
history, you go about halfway across the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen and then probably another two
inches, which is that 10,000 years when we
[SPEAKER_03]: started to do agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he argues, and this is the
important point that I want to make here,
[SPEAKER_03]: that in the early 1900s, we entered into a
third era of agriculture, which he called,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think appropriately, the neocaloric era,
because it's entirely based on old
[SPEAKER_03]: calories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he argues that this will,
if necessary, be a very short period of
[SPEAKER_03]: time in the timeline of human history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can think maybe a half inch or less
on that timeline of human history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the agriculture that way,
or that's the food system that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he points out that this
neocaloric period is the worst energy
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient system we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We now only get about one kilocalorie of
food energy for every 10 kilocalories of
[SPEAKER_03]: energy that we invest in making the food,
putting the food on our tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we think about these old
calories which support that system,
[SPEAKER_03]: as they no longer are available to us,
and we have this terribly energy intensive
[SPEAKER_03]: system, we're in serious trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we really want to be serious about
sustainability, this is the picture we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I want to address with us
in the few minutes that we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have together today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should also mention that when you read
Ernest Schusky's view, you get kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, so we were hunter-gatherers,
and then one day we woke up and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, let's be agriculturalists now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day we woke up and said,
let's be neocaloric producers now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Colin Tudge points out in his book,
Neanderthals, Bannetts, and Farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: how agriculture really began, that that's
not the way it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened over a period of time,
that even when we were hunter-gatherers,
[SPEAKER_03]: we started to do some manipulations of
nature to try to produce more,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when we shifted from the
neolithic period to the neocaloric period,
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers didn't just wake up one day and
say, oh, we're going to start using all
[SPEAKER_03]: these inputs now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That that happened over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably really started in 1840 when
Eustace von Liebig published his paper
[SPEAKER_03]: about how we didn't need to involve
ourselves in the laborious process of
[SPEAKER_03]: maintaining the health of our soil
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we needed to do is put in the three
inputs, the nitrogen, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_03]: and potassium, and then we could produce
all the food that we needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it really took us about half a
century to really fully adopt the
[SPEAKER_03]: neocaloric period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in any case, the system that we have
now is based on a paradigm, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: really true of all of the industrial
economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's maximum efficient production
for short-term economic return.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every farmer knows that that's what
the paradigm he or she has to operate
[SPEAKER_03]: under.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what that means is that you have to
think about this in terms of how you
[SPEAKER_03]: accomplish that maximum efficient
production for short-term economic return.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the way you do that is you
specialize, because that's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You simplify your management, and you go
for economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an individual who was very much at the
heart of this was Henry Ford.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of us probably didn't know that
Henry Ford actually grew up on a farm just
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had already been adopting those
principles in the farming operation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then took those principles when he
established the first automobile assembly
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he once famously said that people could
buy any car they wanted as long as it was
[SPEAKER_03]: a black Ford Model T, because that was the
only one he was going to produce,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that was more efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, he didn't teach every
one of his employees to put a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: automobile together.
[SPEAKER_03]: He taught each one to just do a simple
piece of it, and it came through the
[SPEAKER_03]: assembly line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was insistent on producing
enough cars so that even all of his
[SPEAKER_03]: employees could afford to buy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that concept became adopted in
agriculture, and especially after the
[SPEAKER_03]: Second World War.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you drive through Iowa now,
for example, you don't see 40 different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties of crops the way we used to grow
back in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just two now, just corn and soybeans,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that specialization,
management simplification, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons that GMO crops became so popular,
especially on things like soybeans,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that when you use Roundup-ready
soybeans, you don't have to have all that
[SPEAKER_03]: complex management of trying to figure out
exactly when the weeds are coming and how
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to control them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go out there and you plant your
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wait till the weeds come up,
one spray of Roundup, and the weeds are
[SPEAKER_03]: gone, and the soybeans grow on their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the simplification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Average farm sizes used to be about 1,000
acres in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we actually have one 40,000 acre farm,
and a lot of the farms are 5,000,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question we really need to ask is
whether or not this direction that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: taken and this kind of specialization,
simplification, and economies of scale
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to be sustained into the future
as we meet these new challenges that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be facing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are some of those challenges?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first challenge, obviously,
is energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our current system, not only in
agriculture but our whole industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: economy, is absolutely dependent on cheap
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of energy that we're currently
using is unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had this cheap energy because
we've had stored, concentrated energy,
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily in the form of fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have stored, concentrated energy,
all you've got to do is you expend the
[SPEAKER_03]: energy to dig into the earth and extract
that energy and then process it and make
[SPEAKER_03]: it available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back in the 1930s and 40s,
we sometimes forget, I think, that the
[SPEAKER_03]: first oil well in this country was in 1859
in Titus Hill, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was about 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we didn't go to the oil economy
the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took about 40 or 50 years to really get
fully into the oil economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've really only been in the oil
economy for about 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But during that period of time,
it's been these cheap fossil fuels that
[SPEAKER_03]: have driven not only our whole economy but
especially our food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, as we all know,
the oil prices have gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't need to go into detail of why
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work out that well for Saudi
Arabia anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they started producing as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a short period of time in the
energy picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point, these oil prices are
going to go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: T.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bone Pickens, who's an oil guy,
he told us about eight years ago that we
[SPEAKER_03]: should expect that crude oil will hit $350
a barrel within 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a couple more years to get to
that point now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably didn't anticipate the addition
of oil from fracking and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if we discount some of the
ecological damage from that, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: that can't continue indefinitely into the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at some point, the oil will be $350 a
barrel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question I like to ask,
and I spend most of my time talking with
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, and I really prefer to talk to a
mix of farmers, some conventional farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: some organic farmers, some CSA farmers,
some market farmers, market farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: market farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around the same table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then instead of getting into an
argument about who's right and who's
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong, what I like to do is to say,
OK, let's imagine that 10 years from now,
[SPEAKER_03]: crude oil would be $350 a barrel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's imagine that fertilizer prices
are 10 times what they are today,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're also drawing down all of our
natural resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to read a really important
book on that, Hugo Bardi, who's now
[SPEAKER_03]: published a new Club of Rome report called
Extract It, in which he goes into great
[SPEAKER_03]: detail about all of these mineral
resources and these other natural
[SPEAKER_03]: resources on which we've absolutely
depended for our industrial economy,
[SPEAKER_03]: are now essentially becoming distracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Michael Clare also published a
book called The Race for What's Left,
[SPEAKER_03]: in which he also goes into great detail on
all of these resources that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely dependent on in our industrial
economy are now becoming depleted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he presents a scenario which is very
convincing that we could end up going into
[SPEAKER_03]: a series of resource wars to grab those
last ones that are left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would use the remaining resources to
fight over the resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still want to call ourselves homo
sapiens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nevertheless, these are all
possibilities that we have to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in addition to that, you add the
fact that we're drawing down our
[SPEAKER_03]: freshwater resources all across the
planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, water is essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently we're using 70% of our
freshwater resources, just for agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that is because, of course,
we haven't paid attention to what Sir
[SPEAKER_03]: Albert Howard reminded us we needed to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pay attention to the
biological health of our soil so our soils
[SPEAKER_03]: don't absorb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our soils now have become so
degraded, they only absorb about a half
[SPEAKER_03]: inch of rainwater an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the rest of the water runs off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to use more irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're drawing down our freshwater
resources all across the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, we have to add the
big elephant in the room, and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of these are connected because
climate change, to some extent,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the result of the fact that we haven't
managed our natural systems in ways that
[SPEAKER_03]: are self-renewing and self-regulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to begin thinking now about
a future in which we take all of those
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of things into consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can probably come to the
conclusion pretty quickly, anyway,
[SPEAKER_03]: as to why I said, oh, God, it's all going
to hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to spend the next 15 minutes or
so talking about a different kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: future, which I think is possible for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we have that's
useful to us, that we do have some wisdom
[SPEAKER_03]: from the past about how to do things
differently in a more sustainable way that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually can accomplish a kind of
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're going to concentrate
primarily on our agriculture and food
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those pieces of wisdom from the
past is from Sir Albert Howard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sir Albert Howard already, and he
published this book, An Agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: Testament, back in 1943.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he already understood back then that
this direction that Eustace von Liebig put
[SPEAKER_03]: us on of simply going back to using these
few synthetic inputs instead of paying
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to biological soil, was the
wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, he referred to what he called the
NPK mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: He referred to that as a form of banditry,
because it was going to steal biologically
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy soils from future generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was not actionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in his book on page four,
and his alternative to this was to farm
[SPEAKER_03]: the way nature does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on page four of The Agriculture
Testament, he puts that concept into a
[SPEAKER_03]: summary paragraph, which is a very short
paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I've always thought is a great
concept, a great statement for how we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to think about how we're going to redesign
our food system for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's how he put that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, we can summarize this in a few
words.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we need to do is to partner with
nature rather than to subdue or ignore
[SPEAKER_03]: nature, the way West Jackson would put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here's what he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said,
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how nature functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything gets recycled back into the
system in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: The processes of growth and the process of
decay balance one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ample provision is made to maintain large
reserves of fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, even since we started to do
agriculture 10,000 years ago, it was those
[SPEAKER_03]: reserves of fertility that we depended on
for raising, for producing our food.
[SPEAKER_03]: The greatest care is taken to store the
rainfall, and both plants and animals are
[SPEAKER_03]: left to protect themselves against
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some of my colleagues take exception
to that last statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean, we just ignore plants and
animals?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, you know, we don't attend to
their health anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is not what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's really saying in his view is
that if you manage your farming systems
[SPEAKER_03]: the way nature does, then the natural
immunities and health of the animals and
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants will pretty much take care of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't need to bring in resources
from outside to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the one piece that's missing from his
analysis, which I'm sure Wes Jackson would
[SPEAKER_03]: want to add, is that nature operates on
the basis of perennials, not annuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we were to think about this
concept of agriculture, and how do we with
[SPEAKER_03]: all of our resources that we have at our
disposal today in our modern world,
[SPEAKER_03]: how could we use those resources to create
a farming system that operates under this
[SPEAKER_03]: principle of farming the way nature does?
[SPEAKER_03]: That I think is a huge challenge for us,
and it's a challenge that I think is one
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can address, and one that we can
come up with, and I'll mention a few
[SPEAKER_03]: details on that in a bit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A second wisdom from the past is somebody
that's all known to you here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's Liberty Hyde Bailey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And among his many publications was his
book, The Holy Earth, in which he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: what we need to do now in our agriculture
system is to come up with this new hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to have this new internal
motivation that helps us to recognize that
[SPEAKER_03]: nature isn't just a resource out there for
us to exploit and use, but we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: treat it as kind of a sacred resource,
a holy earth, and we have to learn to
[SPEAKER_03]: relate to that earth in a way that
sustains its health and its vitality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Holy Earth is, again, I think one
of those resources that most of us should
[SPEAKER_03]: go back, and this year, 2015, is the 100th
anniversary of the publication of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my understanding is that CounterPoint
Press is going to publish a new edition of
[SPEAKER_03]: The Holy Earth, and Wendell Berry is going
to write the introduction to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we might want to take a look at that as
a new resource for our students,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, and have some conversations
about, again, that wisdom from the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also add to that list
Aldo Leopold, who's one of my heroes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Aldo Leopold was actually influenced
by the writings of Liberty Hyde Bailey,
[SPEAKER_03]: but even more so influenced by his own
observations of nature and how nature
[SPEAKER_03]: functioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came up with this notion that we
now have to think about the land not so
[SPEAKER_03]: much as a commodity belonging us,
but as a community to which we belong,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that we humans are simply plain
members and citizens of this biological
[SPEAKER_03]: community that makes up this dynamic land
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he developed, out of that
concept, he developed this land ethic,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you all know, so I don't need to
repeat that, but then he ended up saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: so how are we going to implement this land
ethic?
[SPEAKER_03]: And a land ethic isn't something that's
just written, it's something that has to
[SPEAKER_03]: be internalized in us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he came up with this concept that
what we have to do now is to develop an
[SPEAKER_03]: ecological conscience, a conscience in
which we all recognize that land health is
[SPEAKER_03]: an issue that has to be as important to us
as any other kind of ethical
[SPEAKER_03]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do we develop this ecological
conscience?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where he realized this was a
difficult task.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you couldn't simply do this by writing
about it, or by talking about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that this had to be a product of social
evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: But an ecological conscience is a
conscience about land health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And land health, in his view, was the
land's capacity for self-renewal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we begin to relate to the land
in a way?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, by the land, he doesn't just
mean the fields out there, he meant the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire biotic community.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we relate to the biotic community
in a way that it is self-renewing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is critical to how we
think about the future of our food and
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some others that we could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just leave with those three.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have this wisdom in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the science of ecology
and evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, in agriculture,
we have applied almost none of the
[SPEAKER_03]: insights and resources and research from
the science of ecology and evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: biology in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my view, if we married that wisdom
from the past with what we've learned from
[SPEAKER_03]: the science of ecology and evolutionary
biology, I think we could come up with
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible new design systems for our
future food and agriculture system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm trying to encourage
the land grant university that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with and others of us who,
because I think this is a critical role
[SPEAKER_03]: which our university community can
address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you think about it in terms of
the science of ecology and evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: biology, a couple of things stand out,
not only from that science, but also from
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the things that we're learning at
the practical level now, is that critical
[SPEAKER_03]: in this new design of our food system is
restoring the biological health of our
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have here great resources in that
in terms of Van Es, who has been working
[SPEAKER_03]: with Fred Magdoff and others in developing
actually some metrics for how we major
[SPEAKER_03]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to really begin to address
that and figure out how we apply that and
[SPEAKER_03]: how we begin to work with farmers,
and not only farmers, but other people in
[SPEAKER_03]: the food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we're going to restore the
biological health of our soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't continue to do maximum efficient
production for short-term economic return.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to come up with a new paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And farmers can't do that on their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to all become involved in that
because we have to create a new food
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that new paradigm is more a
regenerative, resilient food system for
[SPEAKER_03]: reliable long-term return.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an entirely different paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we redesigned our food system,
it would encourage farmers to move in that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, I think, is part of what we
need to address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we have some interesting
resources here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I don't have time to go into
all of them, but one that has really
[SPEAKER_03]: inspired me over a long period of time is
an essay that Joe Lewis and his
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues, and Joe Lewis was the leading
pest management specialist in the
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture research service for,
I think, almost 50 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 1997, he and his colleagues
published an article in the National
[SPEAKER_03]: Academy of Sciences proceedings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their point in their article was,
after 50 years of experience, he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: we now know that single tactic,
therapeutic intervention strategies for
[SPEAKER_03]: solving pest problems are not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as they pointed out, if you have a
pest problem and you have this single
[SPEAKER_03]: tactic, you come in with a pesticide,
the therapeutic intervention to get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: the pest, that that's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what happens is you never get rid
of all the target pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you create pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you not only harm the target pest,
but you also harm other biological
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms, some of which previously served
to help suppress pest emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're actually causing pest
resurgence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not a sustainable approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they point out in the middle of
that article, they have about three
[SPEAKER_03]: paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, we should not expect any
other different results from genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering than we do from chemical
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the same paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still doing single tactic,
therapeutic intervention to solve a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, rather than what they said what
we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have to do now is to transition to
natural systems management.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they finally end up at the end of that
article with two questions, which I've
[SPEAKER_03]: always loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, instead of asking how do I get
rid of the pest, what we have to ask is
[SPEAKER_03]: why is the pest a pest?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that leads us to redesigning the
system in a way that suppresses pest
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the direction we have to move
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they argue also in there that we
aren't just talking about pest management.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about all of our systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That whether you're a farmer, or whether
you're a schoolteacher, or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're addressing your task as a single
tactic, therapeutic intervention,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're really not enabling people to
understand what's going on in the system
[SPEAKER_03]: that's causing the problem in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the direction we have to move
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is a brilliant article
that I hope everybody, and it's still,
[SPEAKER_03]: all you got to do is Google Joe Lewis and
the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come up, and you can download it
and read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the other things that has inspired
me recently is Dan Barber, who's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: friend of mine, who's a chef, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of you, I'm sure, know him or
know about him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has two restaurants in New York now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, one at Stone Barns, where I
spent part of my time, and one in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan's published a new book now called
The Third Plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he argues, as a chef now, based on his
experience, that the farm-to-table
[SPEAKER_03]: direction, we went from industrial food
production to farm-to-table food
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an important transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to go beyond that now,
because what he discovered is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a chef, of course, what he's primarily
concerned about is getting that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of food which has this exceptional
taste that satisfies his customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And along the way, he discovered that,
as a chef, the easiest way to accomplish
[SPEAKER_03]: that is to find the farmers who manage
their soil for soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you grow food on soil that's
healthy soil, then you have food that has
[SPEAKER_03]: this incredible taste quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a chef, all you need to do is
prepare this food in a way that allows the
[SPEAKER_03]: natural flavors to express themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do all the manipulation
to get the food to do what you want it to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan is also very interested when a
farmer farms in a way that gets this kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of biologic healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the farmer have to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he starts to visit the farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the key relationships that he
had was to Klaus Martens, who's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty close to you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Klaus Martens was producing a variety
of emmer wheat that was out of this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what Dan wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he went to Klaus's farm to see what
Klaus was doing in order to produce this
[SPEAKER_03]: emmer wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he discovered that Klaus had to grow
some cover crops from which he got no
[SPEAKER_03]: income.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to have a crop rotation,
which included millet and barley,
[SPEAKER_03]: which there was no market in the food
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had to sell that as animal feed,
which he got less money for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly Dan realized what he was
doing is simply cherry picking this one
[SPEAKER_03]: product from his farm for his own benefit,
just like going into a supermarket and
[SPEAKER_03]: just cherry picking some things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was not the future of the food
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have to learn now is what he
called eating from the whole farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he started to work with Klaus,
and they figured out ways that they could
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest some of the leafy material from
the cover crops, which he could use in his
[SPEAKER_03]: salads in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started to design some items in his
menu made from the millet and from the
[SPEAKER_03]: barley so he could actually buy those as
food crops from Klaus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this then suddenly put Klaus into a
much better economic situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this concept now of eating from the
whole farm is becoming popular even in
[SPEAKER_03]: Iowa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some people say, you know,
we've got to deal with farmers differently
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to think about what farmers have
to do, what we want them to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then how do we reward for them for
that in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a whole new concept,
which is going to take some time,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure, to catch on every well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's catching on in Iowa,
it can catch on anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the kinds of directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, let me also add one other
little bit of good news here that's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, and that's actually in the
business world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously people in the business
world have to begin to transform their
[SPEAKER_03]: operations as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two resources I'm going to
call to your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one is an article that was published
in the Harvard Business Review,
[SPEAKER_03]: the January, February, 2011 issue by
Michael Porter and Mark Kramer,
[SPEAKER_03]: who are two of our leading economists,
which is important to keep in mind here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wrote this article entitled,
Creating Shared Value.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that article was written to the
business community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what they said in the
article of Creating Shared Value,
[SPEAKER_03]: they said, if people in business continue
to operate by what they call the old
[SPEAKER_03]: playbook, you're not going to be
successful in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And operating by the old playbook is
getting your labor and your raw materials
[SPEAKER_03]: as cheaply as possible so you can increase
your profits in your company and
[SPEAKER_03]: externalizing as much of your
environmental costs and your social costs
[SPEAKER_03]: as possible to increase your profit in
your own company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're going to continue to operate
by that old playbook, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be successful in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is because our labor and raw
materials are now becoming so degraded,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not going to have the quality of
those labor and raw materials where they
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to be successful in your
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you continue to externalize your
environmental costs and your social costs,
[SPEAKER_03]: then your social and natural capital in
your community is going to deteriorate to
[SPEAKER_03]: a point where you're not going to be able
to have a successful business in those
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you now have to figure out how you're
going to do business on the basis of
[SPEAKER_03]: shared value, taking all of these
considerations.
[SPEAKER_03]: These issues into consideration in your
business plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make a very compelling case for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that Michael Porter,
at least, is now doing some workshops
[SPEAKER_03]: around the country with people in the
business community trying to help them
[SPEAKER_03]: understand why they need to make this kind
of transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a second resource which I
think in many ways is equally important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a, his name is Andrew Winston.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has started his own company,
which he uses as a consulting firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: To work with major corporations,
especially in the agriculture and food
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the title of his book is The Big
Pivot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the subtitle is Radical Practical
Strategies for a Hotter, Scarcer,
[SPEAKER_03]: and More Open World.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his point in his book is that if
you're in business and you want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: successful in the future, you can't just
kind of make things a little less bad and
[SPEAKER_03]: hope that you can be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're now in a situation where we
have a hotter world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the effects of climate change which
are already affecting our businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll continue to do so in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're living in a scarcer world where many
of these resources that I talked about are
[SPEAKER_03]: no longer going to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to figure out how you're going
to redesign your business to operate under
[SPEAKER_03]: those circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a more open world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think you can work your way
through this simply with a better job of
[SPEAKER_03]: messaging, you're on the wrong side of
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are now the social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you put out that kind of message
and it's not true, somebody will come up
[SPEAKER_03]: with a 10-minute video to expose you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's going to hurt your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you now have to make a big pivot turn
and fundamentally rethink and reorganize
[SPEAKER_03]: your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: McGinney makes a very compelling case for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these things are happening in the
business world as well as in the physical
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's some other things we
could talk about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe we'll get into them in my
question and answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to end with one other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, I think, the role that the
arts can play in all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we can't imagine a different
way of doing things and a better future
[SPEAKER_03]: and become emotionally energized to do
that, it's going to be very difficult to
[SPEAKER_03]: see how we're going to make these big
pivot turns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to give you just one example of
the way in which the arts can be so
[SPEAKER_03]: effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathleen Dean Moore, who is the head of
the philosophy department at Oregon State
[SPEAKER_03]: University.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she told me once that when she got
into the field of philosophy, she began to
[SPEAKER_03]: realize that philosophers often use such
dense language they don't even understand
[SPEAKER_03]: each other, let alone the general public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she didn't want to be a part of that
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she started to translate these
important philosophical concepts into
[SPEAKER_03]: stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in her book, The Pine Island Paradox,
at one point where she talks about the
[SPEAKER_03]: difficulties and challenges and damages
that we're doing with our wars and with
[SPEAKER_03]: the way in which we're treating our
environment, et cetera, this simply can't
[SPEAKER_03]: go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she decides to imagine her
granddaughter writing her a letter from
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 years in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would she say to her?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the imaginary letter that she puts
out, which I think is a great example of
[SPEAKER_03]: how the arts can be used in such a
powerful way.
[SPEAKER_03]: She imagines her granddaughter saying,
How could you not have known?
[SPEAKER_03]: What more evidence did you need that your
lives, your comfortable lives would do so
[SPEAKER_03]: much damage to ours?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you think that you could wage war
against nations without waging war against
[SPEAKER_03]: people and against the earth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you wonder what we would drink once
you had poisoned the aquifers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you wonder what we would breathe
once you had poisoned the air?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you stop to ask how we would be safe
in a world poisoned by war?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you think that it all belonged to you,
this beauty?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you knew, how could you not care?
[SPEAKER_03]: What could matter to you more than your
children and their babies?
[SPEAKER_03]: How could a parent destroy what is
life-giving and astonishing in her child's
[SPEAKER_03]: world?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you knew and if you cared,
how could you not act?
[SPEAKER_03]: What excuses did you make?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now what would you have us do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is a powerful kind of
statement which can serve to energize us,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because it's our grandchildren
that's going to inherit the world that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're creating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we need to begin to take seriously
these kinds of transitions that we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: make, not only in our food and agriculture
system, but of course that's critical
[SPEAKER_03]: because we can do without a lot of things
in the future, but we can't do without
[SPEAKER_03]: food and water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is what I wanted to leave with
you today and go to some, I'd love to have
[SPEAKER_03]: your concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always say to people, I'm especially
interested if I said something you
[SPEAKER_03]: disagree with, because I'm a
Russian-German, so I haven't had an
[SPEAKER_03]: argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had a good day yet, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, let's open it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Matt's going to repeat the
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sure, everybody hears it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of concept of changing
farming and on a very, what I perceive,
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it was like on a very local scale,
it's on us to do more sustainable farming
[SPEAKER_02]: or go to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the role does the
corporate farming play in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that have to change in the
future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because essentially, part of the problem
is corporate farming and they manipulate
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well that's part of one of the
things that I didn't address, which we can
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about if you want, is we've got a
cultural issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've all become a part of the
industrial economy now, the culture which
[SPEAKER_03]: sustains that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul Roberts published a book recently
called The Impulse Society, in which he
[SPEAKER_03]: makes a very compelling case for the fact
that the kind of culture that we live in
[SPEAKER_03]: now is all about mine and now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, our corporate world also
lives by that culture intrinsically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have this kind of economic system
now, and with each of us we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: capture as much of ourselves as we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, corporations just don't
wake up one day and say, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: business with them, and they will say,
how can I create my business in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to give me the most profit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means you have to play out to
that kind of culture that's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we change cultural issues?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going to happen from
the top down.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are changes that have to come from
the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, one of the things that's
encouraging to me is there's a body of
[SPEAKER_03]: literature now that's coming out,
which is helping us to understand that
[SPEAKER_03]: these cultural transitions need to take
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Roberts does a much better job
describing the problem than he does coming
[SPEAKER_03]: up with an answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nevertheless, he points to these in
some direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Marjorie Kelly, who published a book a
few years ago called Owning Our Future,
[SPEAKER_03]: she makes a very compelling case that this
economy that we're in now, which she calls
[SPEAKER_03]: the extractive economy, where each of us
try to grab as much of ourselves as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible, that's now increasingly becoming
this culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you don't have all the resources to
keep that working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got these concentrations of
wealth that leave so many people out that
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't serve the common good in the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting to evolve now into what
she calls the generative economy,
[SPEAKER_03]: where people in communities are starting
to work together for what she calls the
[SPEAKER_03]: common flourishing of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she gives some practical examples of
the kinds of things that are starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen in various places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if we can begin to point to
some of these generative economy
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence, and some of them are happening
actually in agriculture, she points out
[SPEAKER_03]: that where groups of farmers pool their
production and have their own brand and
[SPEAKER_03]: establish these relationships with their
customers, like Organic Valley and
[SPEAKER_03]: Shepherd's Grain and Notting Branch and
Natural Country Beef, there's a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: them out there, they're actually now
economically much more successful than the
[SPEAKER_03]: corporate individual trying to grab as
much of themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as one example, the average age
of our farmers now is 58.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average age of the farmers in each of
these, I call the values-based value
[SPEAKER_03]: chains, is in their mid-40s to pretty
young.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as we start to see that there
is a success pattern that moves in this
[SPEAKER_03]: other direction that actually is more
based on the common good and the
[SPEAKER_03]: generative economy, this common
flourishing of life, that that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: works better than where each of us try to
grab as much of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could begin to take us in the
direction of changing our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that's gonna happen
tomorrow, but at least it's already
[SPEAKER_03]: happening at some places where that's
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be cynical, I agree with
everything you're saying, but I just
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder about the political economy,
you have power and influence to do this at
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, and I don't see the incentives for
business or the politicians that they fund
[SPEAKER_01]: to really change our complete system,
even though it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen all of the indicators about
climate change, for example, we know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming, it's imminent, and yet we're
really struggling to actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: significant policy changes to reverse
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge momentum to keep everything
the way that it is, related to the food
[SPEAKER_01]: system, related to urbanization,
and our power structure, so how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: grapple with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really important question,
and I don't mean to pretend that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not part of our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the other thing that I think we
need to pay attention to, is that in our
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, in our current system,
which obviously is still working for
[SPEAKER_03]: certain segments of the economy,
and if it weren't working for corporations
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore, it wouldn't be doing it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if you start to look at the
early indicators of some changes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: taking place, let me just give you a
couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cargo Corporation is one of the biggest
defenders of GMOs in our food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have contributed to not having any
labeling, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've not come out with a non-GMO
variety of soy oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hershey Corporation made a decision
here a couple weeks ago that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: transition to a total non-GMO product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why are they doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing this because they're
consuming public, which is increasingly
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that we want to see some changes in
the food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the important thing, and this is
where the power part comes in,
[SPEAKER_03]: the important thing about all of this is
that if you're in the food business,
[SPEAKER_03]: food customers have a lot more power than
if you're in automobile manufacturing or
[SPEAKER_03]: computer manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, in fact, we had a property
extension individual in Iowa who did a
[SPEAKER_03]: research project, this was about 10 years
ago, and she made a case for the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: she thought that food customers had much
more power than any other customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're a company and you're
producing automobiles or computers,
[SPEAKER_03]: as she put it, and if you lose a couple of
customers, you can always get your
[SPEAKER_03]: existing customers to upgrade more often
or buy a second car or a second,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the food business and you
lose a customer, you can't just get your
[SPEAKER_03]: current customer to eat more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in the food business have a lot
of power.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what she did in the course that she was
teaching, she asked her students to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: research project and she asked the
students to go to supermarkets and find
[SPEAKER_03]: out how many people had to go into the
supermarket and ask the manager for a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular product that they wanted in the
same week or how long would it take in
[SPEAKER_03]: order for that supermarket to start
putting the new product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they found without exception was
that if 15 students went into the same
[SPEAKER_03]: supermarket and asked the manager for a
particular product, that product would
[SPEAKER_03]: appear on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she used that as an example of the
power that people in the food business
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my view.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fully agree with you that today,
our political system has almost entirely
[SPEAKER_03]: been controlled by the vested interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are the vested interests?
[SPEAKER_03]: My foreign groups, they're the input
suppliers, the food processors,
[SPEAKER_03]: all who have made huge investments in the
current system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've made huge investments in the
current system because we all said what we
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted is a water and food fast and be
made cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly what they delivered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now after they've invested billions of
dollars, we want to go to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we'd like to have you make some
changes every moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not going to happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is happening and can happen is
that instead of us going to them and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, we'd like to have you make these
changes, is be working together in our own
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you have more customers that say,
this is what we want in our food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, incidentally, is beginning to
happen, particularly in our urban centers,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there is this evolution of what I
call food citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Bill Heffernan, who is retired
now, but he was a world sociology
[SPEAKER_03]: professor at the University of Missouri
and Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, I think, done more research than
anybody else on the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_03]: retail level in the food systems and how
it's that concentration which really
[SPEAKER_03]: controls the food system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, and he told me once,
he said, if the industrial food system
were to choose on the program over for
itself, wouldn't it be just eat it?
That was the era of the industrial food
system.
But then he said, that era is rapidly
coming to a close.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's very much true now
because now it's not that people are
[SPEAKER_03]: simply passive in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are becoming active and engaging in
their own communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have a large number of people
in our urban population centers,
[SPEAKER_03]: where most of these food citizens are,
then they're starting to say, wait a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want a different kind of
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, our politicians are going to
have to pay as much attention to these
[SPEAKER_03]: voting populations as they do to the best
of interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll have the possibility,
I think, of some changes taking place at
[SPEAKER_03]: that national level from the top down.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we've got to be
concentrating, working with people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two quick comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is, I think your talk, I really
enjoyed your talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking more about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: context.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work very much in South Asia where the
issues are just the same but more of a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the people you didn't mention
in Zach's department, and I always put in
[SPEAKER_04]: my lectures that we've got to produce the
food using resources more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to minimize the effect on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've got to maintain the livelihood
so that people actually produce the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all want cheap food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheap food is a political thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't pay the farmers a fair
price for their labor, we're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: more and more farmers leaving the area,
going to the urban areas like we see in
[SPEAKER_04]: India and China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Another really great question,
and you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was focusing primarily on our current
situation in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, part of the good news from my
perspective of what's starting to happen
[SPEAKER_03]: in the developing world is more of a
recognition that for them to adopt the
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial system that we have in the
industrial world is not going to serve
[SPEAKER_03]: them well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've still got some pressure points
trying to bring that system to farmers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the developing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a rapidly growing phenomenon
now where farmers themselves are beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: to recognize that the way in which they
can be successful in the future is,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's also now five U.N.
[SPEAKER_03]: reports that confirm this, and that is
that you want to be, you want to really
[SPEAKER_03]: address the issues in the developing
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you have to work with women
because 70% of the world's farmers are
[SPEAKER_03]: developing with women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, you have to work with them in
terms of their local resources and their
[SPEAKER_03]: social capacity for working together in a
more agro-ecological time frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, they use kind of nature's model as
a way of using their food, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are things that start with
the via campesina group.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been growing pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was mentioning to people here that I'm
working with a young man now who's just 22
[SPEAKER_03]: years old and lives in New York at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he has started a non-profit
organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on his own for a month, 22 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just got back last week from
spending, I think, four weeks in India,
[SPEAKER_03]: six weeks in Egypt, and some eight weeks
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his whole approach is he knows that
there are individual farmers in each of
[SPEAKER_03]: these countries who have already figured
this out, who are already examples of
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he wants to try to connect other
farmers with those farmers so they begin
[SPEAKER_03]: to develop a kind of community approach to
this new direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think there's some things that
we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, Lauren, you're saying this
is not only the future for the developing
[SPEAKER_03]: world, it's also eventually the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to exclude the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason that I put the emphasis
where I did today is that I so often,
[SPEAKER_03]: in groups of people who think this is
simply a farmer problem, we simply got to
[SPEAKER_03]: convince the farmers they need to make
these changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to help us to understand this
is a social issue, an ecological issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we all have to be engaged in it,
but working with the farmers individually
[SPEAKER_03]: is the one that's doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the focus on, obviously, production
systems are focused on the provisioning
[SPEAKER_06]: ecosystem services, but the other
ecosystem services that don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: attention, some farmers are actually
supporting those conservation practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a way to compensate or to
incentivize those other services that are
[SPEAKER_06]: often ignored?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually have a few small programs,
like the conservation programs,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, which try to address that,
but it's such a minor part of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of these challenges that I
talked about, there are significant goals
[SPEAKER_03]: that they would address with the system of
the current system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's, in my view,
it's going to be pretty much a loss of
[SPEAKER_03]: cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking that we're going to be able
to convince people at the national
[SPEAKER_03]: political level, either in Congress or the
USDA, to do that, because they're under
[SPEAKER_03]: constant pressure from the vested interest
to keep the current system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have to bring this about,
you know, to bring the pressure back from
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why my point about the power
of individual consumers, I think about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: is to change that when major companies
don't need to go in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're hearing pressure from customers
starting to pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a better way to move,
not that we should ignore, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the USDA and these other issues and
continue to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the National Sustainable
Agriculture Coalition, which is a lobbying
[SPEAKER_03]: group in Washington, is doing some really
good work to exactly what the nation is
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about, and getting more funding
for conservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see, continue to revisit,
you know, how effective and how we can
[SPEAKER_03]: support them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do that, but we shouldn't
expect that suddenly it's going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the long term, the issues don't
ever stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of us are scientists,
so we're all developing science that
[SPEAKER_05]: changes the technologies that,
you know, affect the infrastructure
[SPEAKER_05]: systems that we're normally using.
[SPEAKER_05]: And presumably they can change those
production systems in ways that you might
[SPEAKER_05]: find favorable, or that you might find
sort of more redemptive or sort of more
[SPEAKER_05]: attractive, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's difficult to tell at the
outset which way we're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so like to my daughter from the
future, my granddaughter from the future,
[SPEAKER_05]: who is writing to me and asking why didn't
I ask, I would say, well, I'm doing my
[SPEAKER_05]: best to try to figure it out, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But so do you have ways of helping people
to figure out if, or what kind of tests or
[SPEAKER_05]: experiments do you propose people in the
science that they're doing to sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: think about the direction that their
science leads to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you all have really great questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, again, I think one of the,
again, I try to, I always try to look for
[SPEAKER_03]: a word or a piece of good news to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, I've experienced this a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to romanticize this,
I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: present it, but there is a growing
confirmation that we're really in a very
[SPEAKER_03]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they recognize this is their
future, this is their world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, an example I'd like to use,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would no more think of taking their
voice to a shopping mall.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see these two kids, this is
[SPEAKER_03]: what makes them feel important and
fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's their parents who are already
part of this millennial generation who
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize that these are the values that
they want for their children in
[SPEAKER_03]: an isolated case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I would tell people when I,
my first American history course was when
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a junior in high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the first day of our class,
a teacher got up and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: guy couldn't have been more than 25 years
old.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got up in front of us and he said,
I want you all to understand that only 20%
[SPEAKER_03]: of the American colonists were in favor of
the American Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, the reason I want you to
understand that is because the reason you
[SPEAKER_03]: should study history is so that you can
learn from the past how you apply the
[SPEAKER_03]: lessons from the past to your future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, if any of you are interested
in bringing in changes, you don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%, you only need 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always remembered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, as I think about this
millennial generation now with these
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds of values which they have
when they're trying to instill in their
[SPEAKER_03]: children, I'm wondering, you know,
do we have 20%?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but there's been surveys as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do know in my own engagement and
involvement in the various enterprises
[SPEAKER_03]: that I work for, both at Iowa State
University, at the Stonefront Center,
[SPEAKER_03]: and other places that I've been,
I keep running into more and more these
[SPEAKER_03]: young people who are in their,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are so many of them, at least,
that are already in this culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I take, again, great inspiration from
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my responsibility is what can I do
with our
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have a better answer to the
question than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, again, the fact that this is already
happening, I think is something we can
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that we can do that may be a
better indicator of the kind of changes
[SPEAKER_03]: that we want to see and that we want to
see in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're already over time a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's incredible to be here for a
couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to just break now and thank
Fred again, and we'll be around in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
