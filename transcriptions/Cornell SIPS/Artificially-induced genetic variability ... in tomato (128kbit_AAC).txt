[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been there a long, long time ago
just for a quick visit to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, actually, it was 26 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the pleasure to visit Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in winter, it's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I will talk about some work that
we are doing in our group at Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will talk about the use of
artificially induced genetic variability
[SPEAKER_00]: and show you some new work that we are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unfinished stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to share with you some
results, the recent results that we got
[SPEAKER_00]: and the strategy that we are currently
using to identify the genes and alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: that are underlying phenotypic traits,
quality traits in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we said before, I'm from Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bordeaux is a beautiful town, well known
for the seaside, which is a wide seaside,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also, of course, for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in our lab, we are working
on tomato, not on grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because, as I will show you
later, tomato is a wonderful model for
[SPEAKER_00]: fleshy fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a joint lab between Inwa and
Bordeaux University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have the pleasure to welcome
you at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, to the Seoul meeting in
Bordeaux, the end of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said before, tomato is a model
fruit for many fleshy fruits, including
[SPEAKER_00]: grape, which is also a berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're interested in is mostly
early fruit development before ripening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially the cell expansion stage
where most of the fruit weight is gained
[SPEAKER_00]: by the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the largest increase in fruit
weight during these stages, after the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: division and before the ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that during the cell
expansion stage, you have a huge increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in cell size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell size can go from 50 micron in some
varieties to 1 millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can almost see the cell with the
naked eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a large increase in cell vacuole,
increase in soluble content, sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic acid, ions, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have also, and this is something that
we don't find in grape, but that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: in tomato, you have a shift from mitotic
cycle to under cycle, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified cycle, and a large increase in
nucleus fluidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you have a storage of
starch that disappears during ripening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and membrane, cell wall, and cortical
biosynthesis to cope with this large
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're interested in, and I will
talk a little bit about that, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism that are involved in the fruit
development at the cell expansion stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the regulation coordination of these
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will talk about two strategies that
we have been using in the last years,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one going from candidate,
identifying candidate genes, and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, as I said before,
unpublished results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will show you how we try to tackle
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have done, this is the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a carpel wall here, pericarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within, the fruit, we have been
interested in two expanding tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: between, after cell division,
[SPEAKER_00]: work anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: After cell division stage to the onset of
ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been looking at these cells
here in the mesocarp, and you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a large increase in cell size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other tissues, we have been
looking at is tissues in the locular
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue in the gel, where you have also
large increase in cell size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these cells are clearly different,
and have a different fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been looking at that,
doing a metabolome analysis, trance
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been done some time ago,
so it was with microarray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the tissues,
the locular tissue, and mesocarp,
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue of the cells are clearly different,
have the same trajectory, but are clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, if you look at the
sucrose here, it mostly accumulates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: locular tissues, and the same for garba
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, we have two tissues that are
evolving during the cell expansion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that are clearly also different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the same for transeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were mostly interested in regular
tori genes, and what we did is the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations between, for example,
one metabolite here, and one metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: here, glutamine, transeps, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had several large number of
pairwise correlations and we went for
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these correlations between
metabolite gene, and then between genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and other genes and metabolites,
and looking for hubs that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case, genes with high number of
correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to know is whether
these hubs that show strong regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two tissues at three stages of
development could be involved in what we
[SPEAKER_00]: are interested in, cell expansion or
transition to other stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we drew a very basic correlation
network, and we had several genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: were identified as hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among them, what we had, and I think many
people here know them quite well,
[SPEAKER_00]: much better than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin, and we know that this gene is very
important for intriguing the onset of
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mutant, very important for
ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: AP2, we know that one homologue has been
recently been shown to be regulating foot
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two genes with no information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are quite confident that these
genes could be important for regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: foot ripening because the other candidates
coming out were already identified as
[SPEAKER_00]: important regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been looking into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is mostly expressed during cell
expansion, and then decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were one mostly increasing after,
at the end of the cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is quite interesting is that
these genes, because we were working on
[SPEAKER_00]: cell expansion, these genes have their
expression modified before the mature
[SPEAKER_00]: green stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been using the tools available,
using what we developed before,
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot-specific promoter that is strongly
expressed during the cell expansion stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this promoter had expression
specifically in the cells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: undergoing expansion in the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in comparison, 35S promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is overexpression,
RNRI, no result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then quasi-technology, which basically
allows us to have a kind of dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: negative mutant for this basic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have is these roots are
whiter, accumulate much less starch than
[SPEAKER_00]: the whiter fruit, which may result in
reduced accumulation of glucose-prutose
[SPEAKER_00]: later during ripening, more malate,
increased firmness, which can be related
[SPEAKER_00]: to effect on foot ripening because what we
saw is that these transient nights,
[SPEAKER_00]: or different transient nights,
we had a strong effect on foot ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been looking at that in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the differences between
Bay-Zip and Y-Tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see that a break onset
of ripening, plus seven days, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe, already ripe in Y-Tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have ripe fruit 15 days after break
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are at this point, we are working on
that and working on different strategy to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to understand how vision can be
controlling foot ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into the detail, but what I
would like to insist on today in my talk
[SPEAKER_00]: today is the second strategy that we began
to use to develop a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to go to identify mutants and to
go from phenotype to the function of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons, as I showed before,
reverse genetics approach can be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tools now, and it was very basic
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what is done now with RNA-seq
analysis, large correlation network,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have very good insights upon the
putative function of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we need to do plant
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know whether it can have a
phenotype or not because it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: redundant and functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to develop,
what we did, is to go for forward genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in tomato, especially, I think the
wonderful resources developed with natural
[SPEAKER_00]: viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most cases, what you need is to have
large fields, greenhouse, human resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like very much this picture from
Deniz Amir, for example, with collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits in Acre in the north of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most of the lab, at least
ours, do not have these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is growth chambers,
greenhouses, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, and we began about 10 or
15 years ago, is to develop artificially
[SPEAKER_00]: induced genetic diversity in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we choose the miniature
cultivar microtome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it can be a very nice
additional source of genetic diversity for
[SPEAKER_00]: functional studies of target gene,
when you have a candidate for gene
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery, and I will show you how all our
sources of new adjuvants for breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one interesting thing is that genetic
background is identical between all
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants except for induced mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we chose is this miniature
cultivar because you can grow them in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, year round, high density,
short cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry at least two recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive mutation was one is dwarf,
but that affects brassinosteroid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis, not in the fruit, but in the
vegetative tissues of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SP mutation, which affects,
which control determined growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequence has been, genome has been
sequenced recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's quite well adapted as a model
cultivar for functional genomics in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that can be quite
interesting, when you use microtome,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cross it with one of these parent,
old parent, which is a money maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is F1 that looks like, that is very
similar to the money maker parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, and we did that several
years ago now, we developed a mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently using 8,500 M2 families
for tuning, for identifying target genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations in target genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did at the same time phenotyping of
3,500 families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been stored in a mutant
database that we are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have to say is that several
collections in microtome are generated
[SPEAKER_00]: now, one being in Tsukuba University,
and we have developed a joint lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing these resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before, we have been storing
these phenotypic data in a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search it for different keywords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we are currently doing,
I won't talk about that today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very, very interesting,
screening for vitamin C mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been known for sugar mutants,
and you can have mutants with as much
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar than in grape, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we are beginning soon
is to screen for starch mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to give you an idea of the
diversity that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you have more than 35,000
different mutations that are phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations that were annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have a large diversity that you
find in natural resources in full shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is very strange-looking
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color aspect, this one has been isolated,
which is a critical mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will talk about that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are interested in fruit morphology,
fruit size and fruit morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the work from Lucy Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other work I'm going to talk about
which is work from Yuan Poti, who is there
[SPEAKER_00]: currently at Cornell for two weeks,
is fruit surface aspect and cortical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are first trait I will focus on
is fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fruit size depends on both cell number,
couple number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is determined mostly or in part
before fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after fruit set, you still have a
cell division that will determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have also cell enhancement that
will determine the size of a cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: depends in tightly correlated in tomato to
endo reduplication process, nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: ploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you see here is from the outer
pericarp to the inside of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a cross section of a tomato
pericarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have been looking at is mutants
with variation in fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or variation in pericarp thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screen such a database, for example,
large fruit, looking at what we have in a
[SPEAKER_00]: database, including pictures, confirm that
phenotypes by growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we can get, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is y-type fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here from here you have outer
epidermis, inner epidermis, mesocarp here,
[SPEAKER_00]: very large cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mutant, which is a large fruit size
mutant, you can see that you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: cells layer, but mostly larger cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is linked to an increased,
this is the same value here, increased
[SPEAKER_00]: endo reduplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have large cells with larger
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, what you have is thin
pericarp, smaller cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that case, it is uncoupled from
endo reduplication because you still have
[SPEAKER_00]: large nucleus, but small cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand how the growth process
proceeds in tomato, these mutants can be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have done is to work on these
different mutants, carcass, lamb,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a principal component
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, what we can see here is
that we can have small fruits with small
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, but with both high ployee and low
ployee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low ployee we are waiting for,
but in that case, we can have a small
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, small cell mutant with high ployee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we are much interested in
understanding how ployee is controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: cell size and fruit size, and these are
very nice tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very useful material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want it, and we want we are focusing
on several of these mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you an example on this one,
which is a thin pericarp mutant with low
[SPEAKER_00]: ployee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that the pericarp is
very thinner than in white upper fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also, but we don't see it much
here, a different shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have done, and I will go
rapidly through it, what you have done is
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin to do a rough characterization of
this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at fruit weight in two
different conditions, one with a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled fruit number, one with
uncontrolled fruit number, in both cases
[SPEAKER_00]: in blue, fruit weight is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also an effect on fruit firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have a white tab here,
and you have two different generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: this mutant, BC1, F2, and F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, firmness is higher in that
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not due because fruit size is
very often dependent on seed number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, this mutant has even more
seeds than white tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a small fruit mutant with high
seed number.
[SPEAKER_00]: More dry matter, high firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been looking at tissue level
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is to look at cross
sections that you see here, white tab and
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at pericarp thickness,
again, we can clearly see that pericarp
[SPEAKER_00]: thickness is different using a tomato
analyzer developed by Esther van der Knap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same for pericarp area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clearly see that it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did also a PloID measurement,
and we see here PloID index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low PloID mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we looked, so it was quite
interesting trying to understand why this
[SPEAKER_00]: pericarp thickness is smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been looking at the cell tissue
structure of different cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw, and this is quite
interesting, is that the mean cell area is
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is more or less because it's
very difficult to be sure of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more or less the same number of cell
layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we saw, and it's not clear from
here, this is white tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look in the mesocarp, you have only
large cells except around the vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the mutants, what we saw is that
these cells, some of these cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of differentiating, expanding,
and so on, are still undergoing cell
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have, we believe, mitotic
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can last until ripening stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we clearly have a different contour of
probably the shift from mitotic cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the cycle in that mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have also looked at the different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time until ripening is more or less
the same, even shorter in that mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some defects which are not from
cortical defects, these brown spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we clearly see also, and we
couldn't separate this trait from this
[SPEAKER_00]: per-cap thickness trait, is that we have
this difference in ripening, and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: uneven ripening in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking more in detail about that
ripening, what we could see is that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually it takes much more time after
breaker stage to reach red-wrap stage in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we believe is that we are still
working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mutant where you affect early
fruit development, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also affect ripening, so later stages
of fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is quite interesting,
trying to look at these both processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to know which gene is
underlying this trait or this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been looking, before that,
we have been looking a little bit more in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato fruit normally accumulates soluble
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Y-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We accumulate soluble sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mutant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, fruit composition is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't accumulate glucose or fructose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been looking, but these are
very preliminary work, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of known ripening regulators or
ATN-induced genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that all the
expression of all these genes is strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: delayed compared to Y-type fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said before, what we wanted to do
was to identify the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a strategy that we have been using is
mapping by sequencing, taking advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of a tomato genome since
two years now, and the current development
[SPEAKER_00]: of the next generation sequencing
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one classical way for that is to cross
the mutant with, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: papillinifolium, which is another close
but wide tomato species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem that we have with that,
working, for example, on fruit-size
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant, is if you do that, crossing
microtome with something that is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will have in F2-segregating
population is segregating for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many different traits, including pericarp,
fruit-size, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be very problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the case for BAT.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that for cortical, when you have a
very strong mutation, you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype population when it's more less
severe mutation is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is to go for NGS mapping by
bulk segregant analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to cross the mutant,
the yellow mutant, with Y-type microtome
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't carry mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case, because this is a more simple
case, monogenic recessive mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the case of a thin pericarp
mutant, you can go to BC1F2, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a segregation between plants showing
the Y-type phenotype and plants showing a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bulk them, two bulk, Y-type-like
and mutant-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can go for wood genome
sequencing, what we did using Illumina,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison with reference to genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice thing with that is that the only
source of genetic and phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: variability are the EMS mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mutations can be used as S&P markers
later, and I will show that this is very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can wait for when you are very
recessive mutation, causal mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or mosaics here in yellow, and this is
unlinked mutation in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at unlinked mutation in mutant
bulk or Y-type bulk, the frequency will be
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the mutation that you are
interested in, the causal mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you are waiting for is a frequency of
one, the mutant bulk, but you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you took out all the plants with
mutant phenotype, frequency is reduced in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Y-type bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that, and this is what I
explained before.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, unlinked mutation,
if you look at a chromosome that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: carry mutation, you have a mean frequency
around 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at one region in a chromosome
that carries mutation, but unlinked
[SPEAKER_00]: region, the same frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you go very close to the
causal mutation, frequency of the mutated
[SPEAKER_00]: allele increases, but that's the opposite
in the mean frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutant bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you are waiting for here is the
causal mutation that has a frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can have a linked mutation that
have also high frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, for example, we didn't have
so many seeds, so we have been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: very small population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been working on 172 or three BC1
F2 individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scored the different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the expected segregation,
where 25% had the thin pericarp phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that co-segregated with ripening
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we constituted different bulk,
for example, analysis of different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Principal component analysis bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we get after sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did wood genome sequencing,
30 to 40 X-coborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the different chromosomes that
do not carry the mutation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is the sliding windows
for EMS mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the curves are almost at
the same level in the case of mutant and
[SPEAKER_00]: white-up bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the chromosome that carries the
mutation, you have a clear and huge
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in these frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I won't show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In different mutants, we are working with
larger populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with a causal mutation in just
one analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we had a smaller population.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is to use the identified
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had different candidate regions showing
this SNP frequency ratio that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for, for example, this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designed, using the different EMS
mutation, we designed markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are Caspar markers, quite easy to do
and cheap to do, and used, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same population to find map mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, actually, is that this
mutation was not close to central mech
[SPEAKER_00]: region, but it was in a recommended
region, which was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't identify it, and we did
using markers, doing analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinants, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't identify any causal mutation in
this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we knew that mutation was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did in that case is to go back to
the data and to look at all different
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, because EMS actually is known
to cause base-based transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we know, and some other groups
did the same in tomato, we know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have not only base-based transition,
we have also transversions, and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: also indels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the mutation was actually
identified, again, by looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations that were filtered out in the
first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified one T deletion in one
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we clearly see here the frequency in
the mutant bulk and in the white-eyed bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: that is very close to what we are waiting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did, again, using different
mutations, certain marker, we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any doubt, assign the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is white-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see that this mutation
is responsible for the mutant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very recent work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we did the sequencing in August
or September, then the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came to about a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are at this point now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the candidate gene that is
responsible for the phenotype that you
[SPEAKER_00]: observed is a guanylate-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know much from what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that role in plants, possibly involved
in C-cyclic GMP signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may interfere with other hormone
signaling pathways, G-perin, oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, nitric oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the question we are working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is, to be absolutely sure,
we know that fin pericap is linked to this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the different markers, larger
population, we want to be absolutely sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that this delayed ripening is due to the
same mutation as the one responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one example of a strategy that
we are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just talk a few minutes about
another work that we have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: On fruit critical, again, same strategy,
going through database, identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants that showed a fruit surface
appearance, different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glossy mutants, you can see that they are,
compared to white, they are more shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dull mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have done, and this is the
work of Johan, is to identify series,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not working on all of them,
of glossy mutants, series of dull mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And analyzing these, we could have some
ideas of the processes that control fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: shininess, glossiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you an example of how
interesting it can be for biotech
[SPEAKER_00]: application later, Johan is working very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he may have forgot some tubes in the
fridge, what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is white-haired mutant,
one year after being in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: White-haired mutant, critical affected
mutant, and another critical affected
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant, but in that case, that mutant,
still after one year, showed very good
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be quite interesting for
looking at critical effects on shelf life
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to show you is how we try
to identify the underlying effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said before, this is an outer
pericarp, you have a cuticle here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cuticle is made of two main polyester.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is cutting, the other one works with
different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is cutting, total cutting load on
these different mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in the glossy mutants,
we have several cutting deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, we wanted to go for this BSA
and just mapping strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have done that, again, a different
bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we have been working with
400 or even 600 BC1F2 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can clearly see that the
chromosome that carries the mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a clear difference in the SNP
frequencies, narrowed down to different
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs in one region, 10 to 15 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we could identify the SNP that
was present in homozygous mutant line and
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, what we saw is that that
mutation was a glycine to arginine
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation in that gene, which is J-PAT,
glycerol phosphate acyl transferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mutation is very close to a
domain that is responsible for catalytic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you introduce the charge amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to this domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this is responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are working on that to demonstrate
that responsible for the loss of activity
[SPEAKER_00]: of J-PAT and for the cortical phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And J-PAT is a well-known enzyme that is
involved in the synthesis of cutine
[SPEAKER_00]: monomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just two snapshots of the
current work that we are doing on these
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants, something that is far from being
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it demonstrates how we can
identify genes we wouldn't think of
[SPEAKER_00]: before, or new alleles for known genes
that might have some importance for
[SPEAKER_00]: applied aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One main advantage of these microterm
mutants, this strategy, this is one table
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have one whole population,
segregating population on four square
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that you can grow that year
round in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have different population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype then go for sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are lucky, if it's in a
recombinant region and so on, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: straight identify the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are currently, and we sequence
different mutants, these high-low mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: where yield is double of normal microterm
cracking aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin C and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one of the last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can further go and use this mutant
collection for looking for allelic series
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gene that you identified before.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example for this gene, which is
involved in carotenoid biocides in the
[SPEAKER_00]: food, we have isolated several mutant,
missense mutation that do not cause any
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on the probably functionable
protein, white type phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then missense mutation, again,
glycine to arginine mutation, strong
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, and you get the tangerine
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with this cow mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, you accommodate
cis-lycopenes instead of trans-lycopene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think now, we begin with tomato
genome sequence that is available not only
[SPEAKER_00]: for Heinz, but also for different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the tools, and we had a very nice
tour this morning, the facilities here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with genome sequencing,
bioinformatics, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the tools, I think,
in tomato genome to use these mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's the same for all plants,
crop species in which we can have EMS
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next, we can also use, but this has
been known for a while, T-Link to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: allelic series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to present you the people
in my group who participate in all that
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucy is carrying out all the work on the
food size mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johan, that is here on the critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daniel is somebody that is central to
all mutant collection, greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cecil, GP, and so on, have been
working on all these NGS maps mapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: and did a very good job on that with
Virginie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Martin was carrying out all the work
on the basic transcription factor that I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we are not working alone,
and we have been working with different
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot, for example, Ali for
Metabolome, Ali Ferney from Max Planck,
[SPEAKER_00]: is using in Gold in Germany for Metabolome
analysis, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish to thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
