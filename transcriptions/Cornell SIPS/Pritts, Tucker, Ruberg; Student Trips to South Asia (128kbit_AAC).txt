[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why South and Southeast Asia?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk in more specifics about the
course that Marvin and I are involved with
[SPEAKER_01]: here in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me speak to this issue just for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One reason that we've about 16 or 17 years
ago started focusing on South and
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia was the rapidly changing
agriculture and food systems in those
[SPEAKER_01]: countries and expanding economies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Important development challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have been going to India for 30
plus years and every few years if you
[SPEAKER_01]: speak to the same farmers about the water
table in their boreholes in the Punjab or
[SPEAKER_01]: in Haryana or UP, they'll talk about the
number of meters it's dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a number of development challenges but
also a lot of innovation in India is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that really attracts me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few students have been to South or
Southeast Asia before and then recent
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements to infrastructure that
accommodates fairly large groups in
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively rural areas because that's
where we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to get off the beaten path.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting place for our
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethnically very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diverse religious affiliations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is certainly not the entire list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical cropping systems for most Cornell
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first time to see turmeric
growing or black pepper or cacao growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being processed or to pluck tea leaves
or to pick coffee or to taste rambutan or
[SPEAKER_01]: jackfruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a rich experience for many of our
students from that perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendous variation in crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming philosophies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fascinating culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marvin must have snuck this one in
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course Marvin's main interest has
to do with the fact that it's warm in
[SPEAKER_01]: January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not warm in Ithaca in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously the decision to focus this
field course in South and Southeast Asia
[SPEAKER_01]: about 17 years ago had some really
important pedagogical dimensions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all we had really outstanding
long term collaborators and three of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are in this room, the faculty from India
right now that were eager to host us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many alumni in all sorts of organizations
in India that were very eager to host us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had experienced and well connected
campus champions.
[SPEAKER_01]: KV Rahman is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Syed Rizvi up in food science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronnie Kaufman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Hobbs had worked there for 20 some
years for CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a number of people here that had
the sorts of connections and experiences
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowledge to make a really rich field
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I just mentioned very briefly
a moment ago, India is a place where we
[SPEAKER_01]: can see really creative and successful
innovation in agriculture and in rural
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known around the world for the
innovative women's self-help group
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amal Dairy Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rajasthan Watershed Management
Initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the list could go on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: India is really a place where you can find
some of the most instructive, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most impressive, some of the most
inspirational innovation when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and rural development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, lots of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also a lot of talent and a lot of
innovation there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I mentioned prominent alums a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this course, this is the course
that this experience is packaged with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a sequence of courses,
a full year sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of it is Agriculture in
Developing Nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a interdepartmental interdisciplinary
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been offered for 50 consecutive
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 50th anniversary for the
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 1,800 students have participated
in that course over the last 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reads like a who's who among leaders in
international agriculture and in rural
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a chance to look over that list a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many faculty at this institution,
I'll back up here in a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no more famous alums than these three
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your colleague on the right there,
Chris Wien, I think participated in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first one, didn't he, KV?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a student in the first,
at that time it was called International
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture 402.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Wien, Bill Fry, Ronnie Kaufman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many other faculty members maybe didn't
participate as students, but have been on
[SPEAKER_01]: the faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been dozens of people,
including many that are currently in SIPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: who have participated as faculty members.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Ken, did you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Ken Mudge in the back there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You did probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian Merwin did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jane Mount Pleasant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many for the faculty, your
colleagues have participated in this
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the alumni, we find many people
who've gone on to be leaders in the
[SPEAKER_01]: international ag research centers,
the CG system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many that are professors,
not only at Cornell, but around the US
[SPEAKER_01]: land grant system and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaders in the World Bank, in the Asian
Development Bank, in the Latin American
[SPEAKER_01]: Inter-American Development Bank,
USAID, Foreign Ag Service of USAID,
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA, and on and on and on we go,
the private sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bump into our students while we're in
the field who work for Pioneer Seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: Cargill or Mahindra, American alums who
went on to make a career in Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purposely interdisciplinary, we not only
have students from all across CALS,
[SPEAKER_01]: but over the years we've had students from
the law school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year I think we had three from the
vet school, ILR, engineering, planning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the comments that stuck with me
that Bill Fry made recently when he was
[SPEAKER_01]: describing the experience he had 49 or 50
years ago in this course as a student is
[SPEAKER_01]: that most of the time when he in the
intervening four plus decades has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: over overseas to work, he works on one
focused thing in one place and he said the
[SPEAKER_01]: only time in his nearly 50 years of
traveling overseas and observing
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural development, the only time
that he's had a chance to see things as
[SPEAKER_01]: whole systems very holistically was in
this particular course because students
[SPEAKER_01]: see everything from agricultural inputs,
spent a lot of time on farms, processing,
[SPEAKER_01]: value addition, and so on in food and now
in textiles as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Human ecology has a cohort of textile
students that travel with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local contacts allow us to get to places
that we wouldn't get to if we were just
[SPEAKER_01]: touring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into rural houses, small farms,
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers, oftentimes there are instructors
or local researchers and development
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners, there are expert resource
persons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning from peers, the Cornell students
will, when we go to India in January
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be learning from the 15 students
and their faculty who are here right now
[SPEAKER_01]: and we hope that the students that are
here for the next two weeks will learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from our students as well, learn something
about American agriculture and food
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that reciprocity also among
faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn from counterparts from India or
Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very experiential form of
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not over there sitting in a
classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're over there in the field speaking
with farmers, researchers, practitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned the class structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full year course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have resource persons that come during
the preliminary, the preparatory course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, last year, a year ago
right now, we were preparing to go this
[SPEAKER_01]: past January to Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the guest presenters for our
fall class that we were able to attract to
[SPEAKER_01]: campus for two days with our students and
faculty was the first U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ambassador to Myanmar who had,
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't had diplomatic relations for
decades during the military regime in
[SPEAKER_01]: Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Derek Mitchell came and spent a
significant time with us in giving a sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of a front row seat perspective to the
changes that have taken place over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last four or five years in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The students do a lot of sharing of their
international experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned before, when we're in
country or when they're visiting us,
[SPEAKER_01]: we spend some time on campuses and in the
field together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Humphrey Fellows almost every year
that participate, they're mid-career
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the January field trip,
we continue on with the spring semester
[SPEAKER_01]: course and the students write papers
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this past year, those group papers,
several were submitted to the Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: policy review and will be published this
fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a couple minutes about India.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's the world's largest
democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really wrestling with its own
identity in many ways and its own
[SPEAKER_01]: development trajectory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon to be the most populous country in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about 1.3 billion people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more than one out of every six people
that walk on this earth is from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last census that I saw, agricultural
census in India had the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: individual farms I think around 120
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those small or marginal farms
in terms of size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a fair amount, even though it's got a
very large and rapidly growing middle
[SPEAKER_01]: class, which a lot of Americans don't
realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a large amount of rural
poverty and food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly don't tell the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another thing we know about India
in this country or we read about,
[SPEAKER_01]: hear about in the media is that it's an
established global leader in information
[SPEAKER_01]: communication technology, computer
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just bring your attention to some
differences in GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that strikes our students when
they go to India is that second set of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are circled density.
[SPEAKER_01]: When our students go to India,
they almost invariably remark about the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come from upstate New York,
I happen to come from a county in North
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Pennsylvania in the Allegheny
Plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a farm in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the population density there is four
people per square kilometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in India is 410.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in parts of India like Uttar Pradesh,
it's probably 12 or 1300 or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very densely populated country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a young population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus the rapid increase in population.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look back just in 1960, that seems
like ancient history to the students in
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like ancient history to
Marvin and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 1960, the population was under 500
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's about one and a third
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very rapidly growing population.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large rural population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about obesity, one of the
things that's changing there and has got
[SPEAKER_01]: the attention of a lot of people in the
field of nutrition is this so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: double burden of malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: As countries have a growing middle class,
as India does, middle class people eat
[SPEAKER_01]: differently than poor people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're seeing fairly rapid increases
in obesity in many developing countries as
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle class grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just point out in closing that
this is the area of India.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin's going to speak to me and Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the area of India that we've been
working in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have students here today that are from
Assam up here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hands if you're from Assam.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Assam Agricultural University
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And students raise your hands if you're
from University of Agricultural Sciences
[SPEAKER_01]: in Darwad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in Karnataka down in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are our partners this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were our partners a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time we went to India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in January of this year,
we'll be in that area for about two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna stop there and Marvin's going to
talk about Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other place that we go as a class
is to Myanmar, which used to be called
[SPEAKER_04]: Burma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it used to be the breadbasket of
Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the reasons is it just has an
incredible climate from tropical,
[SPEAKER_04]: sea level environments to mountains where
you can grow apples and cool season crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of water and soil resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it has the lowest yields per acre
of any Southeast Asian country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you why in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's primarily now a rice based diet that
people eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: People just eat rice all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not a lot of diversity there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And very low levels of fruit and vegetable
consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the reason for this poor
performance of crops and diet that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: very strong is because of the government
and this situation that happened after the
[SPEAKER_04]: British.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got independence in 1948 from the
Brits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there was a coup in 1962.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of took over the country for about 50
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strong centralized military
dictatorship that told people,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to own land or banning land,
you have to grow rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they didn't want people starving.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to revolt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they rule with an iron fist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they rule for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was when Anya Tsu Chi was in
prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she got the Nobel Peace Prize and all
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of strife in that country.
[SPEAKER_04]: As recently as 2012, there was a cease
fire with Chin State, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: several states in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there continues to be ethnic violence
in Rakhine State with the Rohingya people,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you read about, in Kachin and Shan
State.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been going on for years and
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just now hearing about the Rohingya
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's been going on for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the military government allowed
elections in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first non-military leader was
installed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the truth, the civilian leader does
not control the military.
[SPEAKER_04]: The military still controls several
ministries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have a guaranteed number of
seats in Congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the military, even though it looks like
on the surface, it's a democratically
[SPEAKER_04]: elected government.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pull back some of the sanctions and so
forth to help that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The military still rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an iron fist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still, it's causing trouble over the
Rakhine State.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where Myanmar is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's next to India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it borders Bangladesh and India to the
north, China, and Laos and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But notice how long it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like Chile, where it's this
really long country with a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different growing regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all kinds of fruits can be grown
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is, it's also a very poor
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the income per worker,
farm worker, in Myanmar, it's way,
[SPEAKER_04]: way down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: People just don't make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a high rate of poverty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of children underweight because
they don't get enough protein in their
[SPEAKER_04]: diet or fruits and vegetables because they
eat so much rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: The yields per acre are very low in
Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned earlier, here's some
examples of tomato yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at what the yield is in
Myanmar compared to California,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like four times less, same way with
cabbage, watermelon, lettuce, asparagus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't produce the yields that we
do in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it is because they don't have
good water systems or irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have good fertilizer sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: So their production is really low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people don't eat a lot of this stuff
anyway when they grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is fruit consumption in all these
other Southeast Asian countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a global consumption of fruit per
capita on average, almost 80%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 40 kilograms per person per
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look down here, it's Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: And vegetables is the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when they're provided, the culture is
we don't eat fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a result, there's a lot of
malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Chin State, I know the rate of
childhood stunting is around 40%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really high.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a strained infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a major, this is the one
agricultural university in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a department of horticulture
building, the main university.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have these 14 ag institutes
scattered around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the horticulture department.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a photo from one of the labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really, there's a long way to
go there for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really difficult to come in and
help because it's still so centrally
[SPEAKER_04]: managed that for us, we couldn't even go
there and visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to get a letter from the capital
city granting us permission to go and
[SPEAKER_04]: visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we asked to borrow the
curriculum to look at, they had to make a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of phone calls to get permission,
even give us the first year curriculum,
[SPEAKER_04]: like this list of courses that students
had to have because they were afraid of
[SPEAKER_04]: doing something that wouldn't be in line
with the central government's wishes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an incredibly wonderful people,
very friendly, but very challenging to
[SPEAKER_04]: work in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some of the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not a typical, next to the
villages.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a heavily Buddhist country.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some young girls that are in a
sort of a monastery.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the students are there,
they're confronted with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the questions that we asked them to
answer and write papers about are these
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're not just specific,
they're like, oh, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: Terry mentioned this 120 million number of
farmers in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you kind of extension reach 120
million people?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you promote mechanization in a
country where if you put people out of
[SPEAKER_04]: work, what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all kinds of interesting,
really challenging questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you promote more fruit and
vegetable consumption in a place like
[SPEAKER_04]: Myanmar?
[SPEAKER_04]: When we know that they need it,
but the culture doesn't really embrace it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we scientists talk to people in
places where they use these alternative
[SPEAKER_04]: methods to grow food crops, like Vedic
practices, they chant, they use phases of
[SPEAKER_04]: the moon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of us from a Western
perspective, we say, well, that might not
[SPEAKER_04]: be what we would do, but you've got to be
respectful of people who have been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this for 7,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all kinds of challenges that
our students get a chance to face and deal
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does this trip affect students
individually?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have Marcus share his
experience going on a trip last year to
[SPEAKER_04]: Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the pleasure of going on the trip
to Myanmar with KV Terry and Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was asked to just kind of give my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they already mentioned, we wrote a
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a part of a three person group who
wrote a paper dealing with issues of
[SPEAKER_00]: extension and infrastructure that's
getting published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me to talk about the impact that
had on me, I want to just talk about three
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I really noticed when I was in
Myanmar, when we were visiting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different small villages and farmers,
and also just getting to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are really lucky that you're here
now to meet with the students that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be traveling with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that I had wished we
had been able to do because by the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: started connecting with the students,
it seemed like our trip was already over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I really appreciated the work
ethic that all the students had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really struck a chord with me because
they're not only taking full class load
[SPEAKER_00]: credits wise and trying to become plant
breeders, plant geneticists when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: first generation students, but they're
also doing so with all their books being
[SPEAKER_00]: in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even the language they're primarily
speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew for me, it really made me think
about how I've had so many hard classes
[SPEAKER_00]: here as a Cornell student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine trying to learn plant
physiology or like plant genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: Burmese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really impressive to see how hard
that they're all working to better their
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that I really noticed was
just, and they kind of touched on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of information and infrastructure
for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the villages we visited had
maybe one person had a cell phone that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could run on a generator to charge,
but here I can just Google anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird when I don't have access to
internet or resources such as Marvin and
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally weekly walk into Marvin's
office sometimes just to ask him a
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something I really wanted to
make sure that I did better was utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the access to education and public sources
as a Cornell student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final thing, and this was
also touched on, was every village we went
[SPEAKER_00]: to, even though they might have been
growing rice to sell, that was more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritionally dense or better for you
nutritionally, all the farmers grew their
[SPEAKER_00]: own land race varieties and were so proud
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pride in what they were growing
and the education, what education they had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to via extension agents,
even if it was limited, they were super
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of being able to contour farm on a
hillside or grow ginseng to sell at
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, they were super
proud of what they were growing and would
[SPEAKER_00]: feed us their rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a really humbling
experience to see how proud they were of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of like really resonated with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to, I guess for takeaways for
me, I really want to be more engaged in
[SPEAKER_00]: the communities I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a senior in plant science, I'm a peer
mentor to five new students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really unique opportunity to
give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of think that before this trip,
I would have said, oh yeah, peer mentoring
[SPEAKER_00]: is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after the trip, like getting to know
these students who all they want to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: like learn to then give back, really was a
catalyst for me to want to do just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with our publication in the fall,
we tackled different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had what, 15 students?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how many groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had six different groups of varying
lengths, varying subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really also unique
opportunity to work with people who
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't necessarily in your major or like
have a different perspective to also then
[SPEAKER_00]: give back to a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the final thing is just
realizing like, yeah, I feel busy as a
[SPEAKER_00]: student here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always that like extra half
hour or hour I can carve out of my day to
[SPEAKER_00]: either work on my personal relationships
with other students or professional
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with professors to,
I guess, catalyze change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much my five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what Marcus didn't say is a lot of
these countries, the students in college,
[SPEAKER_04]: they get up at 6 in the morning and do a
couple of hours of field work before they
[SPEAKER_04]: go to class.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they come back in the afternoon and
finish up the field work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got real experiential learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very hard work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So quickly, I'm going to just show you a
bunch of slides really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: India, how we travel by bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we travel by train.
[SPEAKER_04]: India is a very beautiful country in many
places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want you to notice it's a little bit
hazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this layer here of smog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of us in the states where
we're used to pretty clear skies,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's pretty hazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it's because there's still a
lot of burning that goes on in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of garbage is burned and wood
fires that creates a haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over much of the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, we're not used to seeing
sewage along the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all have very strong regulations
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In India, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also very beautiful places,
palaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also very crowded, as Terry said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show you a little,
just a little example of a.
[SPEAKER_04]: Students from India might say,
what's the big deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: But for us, this is one of the best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody remember that one of the first
video games that came out was called
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger?
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch this couple here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, for us, it's just pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wait for the light to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of wealth in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't think of any necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a wedding that was going on
outside one of the hotels we stayed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a three day affair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a very elaborate with the stage and
all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terry mentioned water.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of farmers pull water out of these
boreholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they carry water from a central spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of time spent carrying water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typical farm in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few cows, some chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has a motorcycle to get around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throwing lots of different crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the faces of some of the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to notice this field of
tomatoes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some women picking tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this fellow here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's sitting on the ground under the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, one of the things is really
hard for us in this country to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: accept these big, strong gender roles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these women are on the hot sun picking
the tomatoes, carrying them back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he's laying down.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the shade tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he sits and counts the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, here it's a lot more
equal in terms of that sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's very distinct gender roles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we see a tumeric being harvested.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know what this is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still no guesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is nutmeg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're separating it and getting
ready to sell it, drying it in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of intercropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coconut palms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee, chocolate going under the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you haven't seen chocolate before,
some examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, black pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of rice, a lot of rice patties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a, that's a gourd called a,
is it huffing gourd?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart of palm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Banana flowers, bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy birds at the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabbits, anything you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same species we have,
but they're bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see it, saw it cut by hand and
processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: In these big vats where they boil down the
sap basically and make sugar out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corn processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Value added.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a chance to pick tea and crush it and
ferment it and brew it around tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a large scale tea factory where
they're drying the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then different teas we got a chance to
taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: A banana planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: More bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a year from Darwad.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are a couple of graduate students on
a Sunday afternoon at Darwad collecting
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to point that out to the grad
students.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's germ plows and repositories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one for some of the grain crops,
the dry land grains.
[SPEAKER_04]: We visited Tomonado's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a famous agricultural college that
has a lot of fruit growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Indian Institute of Rice Research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pest repellent cafeteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a good name.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a farm for retired elephants that
were used to being around people and they
[SPEAKER_04]: liked to interact with people,
so they got a chance to climb up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: elephant.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Myanmar, another really interesting
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Wien, who went with me in April this
year, said he's never been to a country
[SPEAKER_04]: where the people were more uniformly
friendly as Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people wear this paste on their
face.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: They rub it on their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like a sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a way to keep the skin looking fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of Myanmar is in a delta region.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Arwa-Odi River runs through there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of mountain regions as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were there with the class,
we mainly stayed in a lower delta region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of rice growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Chin State, where it's a lot more
mountainous.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drove around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at the airport in Mandalay and
some guy came running on the bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a Cornell graduate and I can't believe
there's a bus here with Cornell in the
[SPEAKER_04]: front of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to notice the lights display
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like it's painted a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is in Myanmar, each state has
a different license plate, a different
[SPEAKER_04]: color.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you happen to want to drive in another
state, it doesn't have the right color.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just get out the paintbrush and paint
your license plate the right color so you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get stopped by the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while on these dirt roads,
something breaks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a truck broke down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't get through.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all had to get out and push this truck
out of the way so we could get through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some beautiful pagodas that were built
around 1000 AD by the first Buddhist.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came into Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of pagodas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's the Shwedagon Pagoda.
[SPEAKER_04]: President Obama went there a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyang Shu Chi often makes addresses from
the Shwedagon Pagoda.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really incredible, beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people come there to meditate and
pray.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the hilltops are covered with
pagodas of some sort in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very beautiful and spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, for our students, it was a little
bit hard to see these beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: gold-plated pagodas at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the people in the country are
poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a lot of Buddhists, it's like,
well, we don't need to accumulate a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: wealth in this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give it to the monastery for these
pagodas and then we'll be rewarded in the
[SPEAKER_04]: afterlife with something better.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of places where women are not
allowed to go if you're in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another sacred place, Prohibited
Foreigners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Female and males under 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do something bad there,
a lot of people are illiterate,
[SPEAKER_04]: but here's a picture that shows you what
happens if you fool around with another
[SPEAKER_04]: woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you gossip about somebody over there,
the devil will cut your tongue out in
[SPEAKER_04]: hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you booze it up too much, you got
waterboarded there or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of really cool things we did
there was we took hot air balloons rides
[SPEAKER_04]: in the morning before the sun came up over
all those pagodas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see all those pagodas out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the sun's coming up and it hits the
gold roof of the pagodas, it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: spectacularly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: These animals are being replaced with some
of these crude machines, but these
[SPEAKER_04]: machines can be used for lots of purposes
and they're becoming very popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: These will pull behind tractors.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were there in the dry season,
but it rained one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were there during dry season and the
growers freaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to visit a vineyard the next day
and they were spraying fungicide because
[SPEAKER_04]: it rained.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, they're just mixing whatever they
can find together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bag of furadan out there,
which we don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fellow here was mixing it in his tank
and then they were pumping it out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: hose and they were hauling the hose down
the row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then somebody there with the protective
equipment on was spraying the initiated
[SPEAKER_04]: gloves, was spraying the grapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing I want to show you is we
went to this Inle Lake, where there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: place that got lots of flooding after
rainfalls and the water level went up and
[SPEAKER_04]: down and the people's gardens would get
flooded out.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they did was they decided they were
going to move the village to the water and
[SPEAKER_04]: build these mats where they could put the
vegetables on the mats.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the lake level would rise,
the vegetables would just float up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: mats.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would go through these villages and
drive right through the eggplants and so
[SPEAKER_04]: forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tomatoes, they float.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell me time's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll stop right now and see if we have
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
