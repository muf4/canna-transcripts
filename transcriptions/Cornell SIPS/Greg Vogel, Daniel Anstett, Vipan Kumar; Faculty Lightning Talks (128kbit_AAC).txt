[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well I'm excited to tell you all a
little bit about my research and extension
[SPEAKER_01]: program in tomato and eggplant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so first to give you just some very
high-level goals of our research and
[SPEAKER_01]: extension program.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, you know, maybe the
most important goal is to develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: release cultivars and germplasm that are
adapted to the Northeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: with high yield quality and resistance to
the diseases of importance in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do more fundamental work
discovering and characterizing traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: are of importance whether to farmers or
consumers in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also really interested in modeling
strategies for implementing new
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies in an applied vegetable
breeding program and specifically what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to are things like genomic
selection, high-throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that have become almost
routine in some large-scale breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs for agronomic crops, but in
horticultural species they're much more
[SPEAKER_01]: rarely used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some legitimate reasons
for that and you know, I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: just testing out ways that we can do this
practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, I have a 40% extension appointment
and what we try to do is to generate and
[SPEAKER_01]: disseminate results on variety performance
in New York for our stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the first thing I try to do
after I started in my position about 16
[SPEAKER_01]: months ago was to get an idea of,
you know, who the stakeholders are in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York, what does tomato production look
like so I could focus our breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really quite a diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, tomatoes are grown in the open field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're grown in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some of the most
sophisticated greenhouse companies in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of Green Empire Farms,
which is a 32-acre greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of Syracuse, tomatoes are sold
wholesale at produce auctions and to
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers and to grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also sold directly to consumers at
roadside stands and farmers markets and
[SPEAKER_01]: through CSA shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I found that maybe is
consistent in the matter, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I visited is tomato diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even there, you know, there's quite a
variation depending on the management
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and growing system and what
specific diseases show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's a look at what we focus on in
the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's a pretty extensive
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think maybe I have my work
cut out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to just kind of summarize the targets,
the traits that we focus on, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: things like earliness, yields,
a plant habit that's amenable to staking
[SPEAKER_01]: and easy harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the suite of diseases that are
important whether in the open field or in
[SPEAKER_01]: protected culture in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruit quality in terms of cleanliness of
fruit is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, these are tomato varieties that look
like maybe some of our most favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom varieties but have some of the
disease resistance and productivity of
[SPEAKER_01]: modern varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then quality of all types is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, flavor is maybe one of the most
important traits but also one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might have skipped over a slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's just a snapshot of how we do
our breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture actually of an eggplant
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did our first eggplant crosses
this month actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes were about a year into our
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use a combination of marker
assisted selection and phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here there's a student in the lab
actually selecting the seedlings that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the disease resistance markers that we
tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing we do is put
those seedlings out in the field and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate them for the traits that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this past summer was our first field
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had about 2,000 early generation
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all genetically distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we spent a lot of time walking through
and looking at these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a picture of some of our
favorite selections from this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited to see how those look in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I spent a lot of time talking about
tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about eggplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think eggplant is interesting because
there's a bit of a discrepancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, it's ranked 28th in
terms of per capita consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we eat a little bit less eggplant than
we do radish and a little bit more than we
[SPEAKER_01]: eat kale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But worldwide, it's 10th in production in
2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, around the world, there's a little bit
more appreciation for eggplant than there
[SPEAKER_01]: is by many of us here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does this matter to a breeding program
based in the Northeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Population growth in the United States is
most likely going to be driven by people
[SPEAKER_01]: with recent roots in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: This map is showing circles that are
proportional to the size of that state's
[SPEAKER_01]: population that was born outside of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at New York, for example,
today, almost one in every four residents
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York State was born outside of the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think there's a lot of potential for
new market opportunities for some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes for other crops as well that
are appreciated by people with roots
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one of these eggplant types that I'm
really interested in, we've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: fun looking at so far, is what broadly are
referred to as African eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two different species,
Solanum aethiopichum and Solanum
[SPEAKER_01]: macrocarpin.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were domesticated in Africa,
are still very important vegetable crops
[SPEAKER_01]: in Sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of
Brazil, Italy, and South and Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a small grant from the Tour of
Sustainability Foundation Program to
[SPEAKER_01]: partner with some of our colleagues in
Extension and some urban gardeners and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers across the state to do some
participatory variety evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten really good feedback about
what people are looking for and we're now
[SPEAKER_01]: starting crosses and hoping to have a
participatory breeding program where
[SPEAKER_01]: people can make their own selections,
evaluate things that have the traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking for and still select for
adaptation to this climate in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give just a quick snapshot of
one of our kind of trait discovery
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that we've been working on for
about a year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a project focused on salinity
tolerance from a wild tomato species
[SPEAKER_01]: called Solanum citiens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solanum citiens is a wild relative of
tomato that is endemic to the Atacama
[SPEAKER_01]: Desert of Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a region of the planet that gets,
you know, some parts of it get about half
[SPEAKER_01]: an inch of rainfall a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've discovered populations of this
species growing in what are essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: salt basins, soils with an electrical
conductivity, approaching a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: deciSiemens per meter, which is like 40
times what domesticated tomato can
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are working with a population of
integration lines developed by a
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher at UC Davis who spent decades,
you know, moving genetic material from
[SPEAKER_01]: this species into tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really fortunate to be able to,
you know, pick up the legacy of that
[SPEAKER_01]: research and evaluate these lines for
tolerance to salinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a picture of our setup in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are fertilizer injectors,
but instead of injecting fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: into our drip irrigation lines,
they're just injecting different
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one greenhouse experiment over the life
cycle of the plants, we go through about a
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 pound bag of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are just looking for lines that are
able to tolerate this more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticated control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually wrapping up the harvest of
our first set of lines this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited to see what we find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, I'll just kind of mention a little
bit about our extension program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of a field day we had
last summer that I'm hoping we can make an
[SPEAKER_01]: annual field day along with some of my
other colleagues in vegetable breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We invited people from, you know,
gardeners, farmers, members of seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to look at some of the
commercial variety trials that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just released a report describing one of
our variety trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being disseminated through different
CCE newsletters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is in VegEdge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you are interested,
you can find it there or reach out to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can share that information with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to speak pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I was within the time, but if any
of you have any more questions or want to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out, here's my contact information
and I'll thank the members of my lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: our collaborators and our sources of
funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the salinity tolerance geared toward
greenhouse tomato production ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: or?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of two things that we're
looking at with the salinity tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is it's a big problem actually not in
New York, in California, and we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: funding from the California tomato
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But closer to here in New York,
yeah, in protected culture, salinity can
[SPEAKER_01]: become an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a challenge in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you exclude precipitation and apply
fertilizer and irrigation water,
[SPEAKER_01]: salts accumulate in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's ways to manage that
through farming practices, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: another angle that we're taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking into your crystal ball,
you mentioned other crops that might be
[SPEAKER_04]: growing importance in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would be a couple of examples of
those?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what they would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually part of a group that's
putting together a proposal where this
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a portion of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to do like a stakeholder
needs assessment and have people suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: to us what are some of these crops that,
you know, they are currently growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: wish to grow, but the varieties might not
be, you know, well adapted to New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's potential for breeding there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I want to keep it relatively
short and sweet, but just kind of go over
[SPEAKER_00]: the main thrusts of the research program
that I'm establishing here in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big focus of this is on plant
evolutionary responses to climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: where in addition to heat, really drought
might in fact be one of these key drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: of rapid evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evolutionary change that we see not
over millions of years, but of a short
[SPEAKER_00]: small number of generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work that I've started
actually from Western USA where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: this exceptional drought that happened in
California between 2010 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plant, Scarlet Monkey Flower,
or Mammalus cardinalis is found throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: California and into Southern Oregon,
which as you can see in 2010 was fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: drought free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some drought in perhaps Nevada
and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can think of a population
occurring anywhere across this range as
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps having some amount of genetic
makeup where there were perhaps more a wet
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted at the time, because it was
generally Mediterranean climate where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the rains that come in in the winter
and you get adaptation to having access to
[SPEAKER_00]: this flowing water in this riparian plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there might be some amount of genetic
variation for various drought resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, these, whatever they might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the severity of this drought was
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't just that any one year was
particularly severe, but that year after
[SPEAKER_00]: year, essentially in some parts of the
South, this water almost stopped flowing
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely in some of these riparian areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just really much more
selection pressure in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: range as well than perhaps the system had
ever experienced in terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we can think about,
my lab really brings in both ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: and evolutionary aspects together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see right here,
if each of these dots here is one
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, and this is a particular
genetic makeup, you can see there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: crash in population selection is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of individuals are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the individuals that have more drought
adaptations are performing better and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this drought thing continues and
continues and continues throughout here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's many different selection
events that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, this population is going
to be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many places, we found that evolutionary
rescue was actually occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there was this correlate
between the increase in population size
[SPEAKER_00]: and the increase in these climate-adapted
SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't know the exact genes that
were underlying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, we did whole genome sequencing and
associated ultimately millions of these
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs to particular existing climate
layers, because the southern part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: range was already well drought adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can make some inference that
spatial differences in climate could
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately help us find parts of the
genome that were perhaps underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so largely, we found a surprising
number of areas that this rebound of the
[SPEAKER_00]: populations was correlated to rapid
evolution, and not just to the betterment
[SPEAKER_00]: of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, it was the underlying genetics
that was this key predictive factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really interesting in that
essentially this demonstrates evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue in the wild with years of
demographic data, as well as genomic data,
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that's fairly rare within
studying contemporary evolution in natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the type of approach,
largely, that I did in my postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wrapping up now that I'm
looking to bring forward into my research
[SPEAKER_00]: program, moving forward, where it's really
looking at evolution across climatic and
[SPEAKER_00]: now phylogenetic gradients, because I want
to move away from one species framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, this is a sample size of one,
a species that we know is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically diverse, and into a variety of
species that might have a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the targets will be genomics is
sort of kind of more universal in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can look at the landscape
genomics of various different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as well, morphology, life history
traits that can be critical for mismatches
[SPEAKER_00]: with temperature or with the amount of
drought, as well as potentially herbivory
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemistry, sort of work that I've done
a lot in my PhD, and I'm eager to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in my time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think of it so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this one species where I looked at
these series of populations across Western
[SPEAKER_00]: North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, to get more insights for
happens, it would be useful to compare it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a closely related species that might
also have perhaps certain geographic and
[SPEAKER_00]: or trait differences and to try to
understand if this other closely related
[SPEAKER_00]: species is it also showing many of the
rapid evolutionary responses that this
[SPEAKER_00]: first species is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can guess, here I have a
phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to sort of talk about
these in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just first focusing on this one,
what might we expect happens when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: two organisms that are relatively similar
geographic environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps some of the underlying population
history or the traits that they experience
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves or the type of
microenvironments in which they live in in
[SPEAKER_00]: these natural populations might mean that
on the whole, maybe they're performing
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly because they're fairly similar
in these regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe there's something kind of unique
about what they're ultimately doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps in a different environment,
in the prairies or here in the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: where perhaps we might see different
evolutionary outcomes when you compare
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related species that are
inhabiting similar environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be a big thrust in
my program moving forward of finding
[SPEAKER_00]: species where I'm able to essentially get
a combination of different resources to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to be able to see over space and
ultimately over time what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: these populations and how they're
performing over the last few years and
[SPEAKER_00]: then potentially deeper into time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be potentially done
through a combination of seed collection
[SPEAKER_00]: and herbarium samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was very fortunate to have
extensive collecting that was done within
[SPEAKER_00]: Mimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I can't really build a time
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best we can do is to try to
find other systems where the seeds have
[SPEAKER_00]: already been collected and I can sort of
use those resources or to start planning
[SPEAKER_00]: now for the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years in
the future throughout my career to build
[SPEAKER_00]: those baseline samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strategy is going to be a little
bit mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there are some seed collections
of 50 or so species that were done around
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2010s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already giving some amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also pairing these up with
herbarium samples that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps going on to the 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, our herbarium collection here
has many samples that are particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: rich from the 1880s to the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've spent quite a bit of time this
term sort of looking at certain target
[SPEAKER_00]: species where I have both the seeds and
also potentially large swaths of herbarium
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of the prop of concept here is
Black-eyed Susan, where I have seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: available fairly deeply sampled from
around 2014 across this latino gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's many, many herbarium
samples just from this herbarium alone
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 1880s to 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's the potential then to do
some ancient or near-ancient DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing to ultimately come up with
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the challenge will be,
as I develop this system and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: other systems as well, to try to get these
new systems, at least new to my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: to ultimately grow well in various
greenhouse or grow chambers or even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, which is something you'll
appreciate in horticulture and something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll be myself and my lab will be
engaging in the coming years as we seek to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand out beyond the sort of a one-system
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the variety of different
habitats in California that I've sampled
[SPEAKER_00]: from a list right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you infer anything about jaw tolerance
from morphological traits on these
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium specimens and go back,
say, 100 years or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that too difficult?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the work that I've done already
with morphological, myself and my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues have done, we looked at simple
things like SLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a colleague that was
looking at the actual number of cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: the thickness of the mesophyll and all
these kind of more functional
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be interesting to see if we could
section a dried leaf and actually get any
[SPEAKER_00]: useful information out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been challenging enough to do it en
masse, kind of at scale across populations
[SPEAKER_00]: within just a living cell, really,
because if we're going to be quantitative,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of phenology, yeah, there's
always potential to say something about
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time, for example, in terms of
when the herbarium samples were collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the awkward bit is that you only have
the bias of whoever was collecting at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and when they were collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're in a case where you're
inferring across a variety of missing data
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are protocols that help take
uncertainty and deal with it in
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially meaningful ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a certain amount of it will
depend on the amount of student interest I
[SPEAKER_00]: have in morphology versus genomics as I
start recruiting members to my lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you, Joss.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Bill, for the invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you all for the attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Vipin Kumar, and I'm associate
professor with Soil and Crop Science.
[SPEAKER_05]: My appointment with the section is
research and extension, 60% research and
[SPEAKER_05]: 40% extension.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do work with the producers,
consultants, industry partners and other
[SPEAKER_05]: stakeholders in the state, as well as in
the northeastern states in terms of weed
[SPEAKER_05]: management issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to talk about some projects
we have started.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my second year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wrapped up our second growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I work in field crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to talk about some weed
control projects we have started in field
[SPEAKER_05]: crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first one is talking about new weed
species in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys might have seen or been heard
about Palmer amaranth or pigweeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two new species have arrived in
the state, Palmer amaranth and waterhemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first two pictures you see,
those are Palmer amaranth inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is a male.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second picture is Mike Stanyard,
our Cornell Cooperative Extension team
[SPEAKER_05]: lead for Western New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was scouting some field this growing
season and asked me to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found some new reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are this growing season from soybean
and corn and alfalfa fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like six different grower fields
where we saw Palmer amaranth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these two pictures on my side is the
waterhemp, another pigweed, highly
[SPEAKER_05]: invasive, highly problematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both pigweeds are basically very,
very problematic in Midwest and other
[SPEAKER_05]: southeastern states, but also has arrived
now in the New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we are trying to do is we are
characterizing these populations for any
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of herbicide resistance evolutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are doing greenhouse testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are doing some field experiments,
looking at different herbicides.
[SPEAKER_05]: An example here in this slide is we are
doing some dose response studies looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at glyphosate resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you see, there is a New York
population and Nebraska population side by
[SPEAKER_05]: side comparison for waterhemp showing
resistance to Durango, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: glyphosate active commonly used in our
field crop systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture on my side is my graduate
student, Henrique Scatina, is a master
[SPEAKER_05]: student under myself and Dr. Lynn
Sosnowski holding a waterhemp plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a glyphosate resistant waterhemp
plant near Waterloo growing in soybean.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's looking at some option, herbicide
option that we can use alternate options,
[SPEAKER_05]: pre and post-herbicide options,
as well as looking at the growth as well
[SPEAKER_05]: as reproductive characteristics of some of
these herbicide resistant population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with those waterhemp and Palmer
amaranth, we have also been testing some
[SPEAKER_05]: grass species like annual ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are some population came from grower
fields were using annual ryegrass as a
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those cover crops, they were not able
to terminate with the glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have becoming a problem now as a
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are testing those along with those
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also investigating other
problematic species like lamb squatter,
[SPEAKER_05]: common ragweed, giant ragweed,
some other grasses like foxtail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a kind of long-term ongoing
projects got funded by Hatch and
[SPEAKER_05]: Smith-Louis France this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are trying to look at as original
approach from other states as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: multi-state project, characterizing
resistance and locating those resistance
[SPEAKER_05]: population in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another example is a horseweed population.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very typical response we are
seeing in horseweed population from New
[SPEAKER_05]: York.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a population we collected actually
been sent by our CCE.
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks from central New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been testing this with different
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, commonly used herbicides in soybean
and corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing issues with the Roundup as
you see here on the picture compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: the non-treated.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have soybean products like Cobra,
Synchrony, even corn products like
[SPEAKER_05]: Callisto showing issues with controlling
these horseweed population.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very consistent response.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 10 population screen so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar response we have been seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are again the pictures of annual
ryegrass just sent by the growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see the picture on the very left from
last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the same field in this growing
season where he had wheat and he's been
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing with this glyphosate resistant
annual ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are trying to figure out what alternate
options, alternate methods we can employ.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have together a AFRI grant just to
look at the wheat seed bank methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the middle picture is again another
annual ryegrass cover crop was not getting
[SPEAKER_05]: terminated with the two shots of Roundup
in Ontario County.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see very quickly some of these
cover crops can also be problematic as
[SPEAKER_05]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So along with those herbicide resistant
screening and testing and correct rising,
[SPEAKER_05]: we are also looking at field works at
especially product evaluation program
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at alternate option.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, we want to give producers the
immediate options they can use to control
[SPEAKER_05]: these herbicide resistant weed
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pictures we have one of my
graduate students looking at options,
[SPEAKER_05]: herbicide options in different trade
technologies like conventional corn or
[SPEAKER_05]: Roundup ready corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: What options do we have to control
glyphosate resistant water ham?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a picture from Wayne County.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wayne County producers growing
conventional corn, a silage corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: What options do we have to control this
glyphosate resistant water ham?
[SPEAKER_05]: Similarly, these are producers on farm
studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are looking at options like a
pre-applied as well as a post-applied
[SPEAKER_05]: herbicide options for controlling
glyphosate resistant water ham as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: other weed species.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to product evaluation or
herbicide based weed control, we are also
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at non-chemical weed control
tactics.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my graduate student, PhD student
looking at side by side comparisons on
[SPEAKER_05]: innovative weed control tactics such as
interim or selective weeder as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest weed seed control.
[SPEAKER_05]: How those tactics we can integrate into
our system as a holistic approach for
[SPEAKER_05]: targeting those weed seed bank management.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is again another way of looking
things from the system standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are integrating some of our precision
egg tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my PhD student also looking at
precision egg tools such as the sensors
[SPEAKER_05]: and cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: How we can use the drone based imagery to
detect and identify weed species in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field and that information can be used to
make decisions for controlling those weeds
[SPEAKER_05]: because artificial intelligence is quite
popular now and we want to use that
technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: To identify and manage these weeds more
site specifically and species
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at these integrating these
chemical non-chemical weed control
[SPEAKER_05]: strategies as I said, some of these
projects have been funded by USDA NIFA
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at multi-tactic approach including
cultural practices, including precision
[SPEAKER_05]: ag, including mechanical approaches like
harvest weed seed control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, I guess my overall vision for the
research and extension program is to
[SPEAKER_05]: develop sustainable and economical IWM
strategies for the producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, my program looking at
different aspects, looking at the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultural, chemical, precision ag,
and mechanical tactics, how we can
[SPEAKER_05]: integrate them together to help producers
to make those decisions, how to control
[SPEAKER_05]: these tough to control weed species.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not put together any slide for my
funding agenda but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: support from New York corn soybean
producers, industry partners, as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA NIFA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been working closely with some
multi-institutional teams like a grow team
[SPEAKER_05]: which is called Getting Rid of Weeds run
by USDA ARS, Dr. Steven Mersky at
[SPEAKER_05]: Maryland.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are educating producers on some of
these issues and helping them to make some
[SPEAKER_05]: of those decisions on how to control these
tough to control weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my last slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering about this for the second
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll ask now your picture of the,
I think it was the horseweed control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually looks like glyphosate
treatment is more vigorous than the
[SPEAKER_03]: untreated control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it conceivable that the population
somehow grows even better in the presence
[SPEAKER_03]: of glyphosate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done any work to look at
closely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are examples in the literature
that shows that because of resistance
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanisms, we don't know what mechanism
we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are examples in GMO rice that has
shown with mutations, with the increase in
[SPEAKER_05]: copy number, EPSPS gene copy number,
that is the mechanism of resistance to
[SPEAKER_05]: glyphosate in those GMO rice, they have
found increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have found increase in growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is called fitness.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be doing some fitness studies to
look at the fitness cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is a cost or there is no cost or
there is a benefit of that fitness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those things help us to devise
strategies how we can implement our weed
[SPEAKER_05]: control tactics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely excellent question.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being from weed science background,
we have done some of that work in Koshia
[SPEAKER_05]: where we did not find any fitness cost due
to glyphosate resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, these population we are dealing
with in these waterhemp, armor or
[SPEAKER_05]: horseweed, they are probably not only
resistance to glyphosate but multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance to other chemistries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So especially resistance to oxygenics like
240 dicamba, we have seen there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: fitness cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a matter of what resistance we are
talking and what mechanism we are talking
[SPEAKER_05]: that can determine the fitness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other question?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant biology series on Friday,
Ginny Moore from Plant Breeding Genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: gave a pitch on her program around
breeding for sustainable cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you are talking about the problem that
they are becoming too sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are weedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of adoption of cover crops,
how much is weediness a really huge
[SPEAKER_04]: concern?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this plan, the annual ryegrass,
I am talking in general is tough to
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is tough to terminate if you are using
a cover crop and there is a specific
[SPEAKER_05]: guidelines if you are going to use a
chemical to terminate these cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we are trying to educate producers,
if you are going to use this as a cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crop, be proactive when you are going to
terminate, make better plans, what weather
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions you are going to have when you
are going to apply those glyphosate to
[SPEAKER_05]: terminate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, irrespective of resistance,
this plant is hard to control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are trying to educate like this is
a closely related species to Italian
[SPEAKER_05]: ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Producers in the south, they are dealing
with this more aggressively because they
[SPEAKER_05]: were using annual ryegrass as a cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem there is some of these
seed companies are selling the annual
[SPEAKER_05]: ryegrass as a VNS, variety not specified.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are mixtures coming from the south.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those seed bags are having
varieties from different regions and that
[SPEAKER_05]: caused problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I have exact answer how we
can increase the adoption.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are species which are perfectly
fit in terms of if you are going to use
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical to terminate those.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other methods to terminate
those cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely cover crops are foundations for
weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks in the New York state are pretty
excited about other benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think weed suppression is,
again, top benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Producers in the Midwest and other states,
they are looking for and adopting cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crops, especially cedar rye, if we talk
about cedar rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I guess depending on the goals of
adopting cover crops or growing cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crops, it depends how you are going to
terminate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we are trying to educate,
plan properly what you're growing for what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're growing and how you're going to
handle this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
