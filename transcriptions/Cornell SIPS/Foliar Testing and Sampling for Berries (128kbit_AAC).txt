[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marvin Pritz, who is with the
Department of Horticulture at Cornell and
[SPEAKER_00]: is our berry expert here in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week, he's going to talk about
foliar testing and visual assessment of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in established berry plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready to go, Marvin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure am.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait till my clock here says
2 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, am I running early?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's topic is foliar testing and
sampling in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little bit technical in
places, so feel free to use the box and
[SPEAKER_01]: chat box and submit your questions that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to review the principles we have
talked about up to this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: we talked about soil testing, how that's
most useful prior to planting,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we adjust our pH and adjust our
nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now what we want to start talking
about is leaf analysis, which is most
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate once the planting is
established.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like leaf analysis better than soil
analysis for established plants because it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually determines what the plant itself
has taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit more accurate
assessment of nutrient status than
[SPEAKER_01]: estimating availability from a chemical
extractant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the chemical extractants do for
the soil is they try to mimic what the
[SPEAKER_01]: root takes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have the actual plant taking
up the nutrient, why not use the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of the extractant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the logic there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's particularly important in
perennial crops where nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up one year can be stored in reserve
and used again in subsequent years,
[SPEAKER_01]: where a soil test doesn't really tell you
what the plant is going to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient once it's taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fuller testing is much better for
assessing nutrient status in established
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's based on a simple principle,
and that is look at what the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are in leaf tissue and compare it
to a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no different than getting your
cholesterol tested at the doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what sort of a normal range is
and we can look and see if we fall within
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're too high or too low,
we can do something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have standard ranges for
strawberries, for raspberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: for blueberries, for all sorts of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll look and see if our nutrient
falls within that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems pretty simple and
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll deal with these numbers in a lot
more detail in two weeks, but I just
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to give you a sense that these
standards do exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basis for the standards are the same
from lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't have this issue like we do
with soils where it really depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction method as to what your results
are going to say and going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody pretty much uses the same type
of analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use these inductively coupled plasma
spectrometers to look at the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient that's in a particular amount of
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way this works, and the thing I
think of most is when at least when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: a kid we had a fireplace and we had this
little bag of chemicals that had different
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salts in there and we would throw
it into the fire and a fire would glow
[SPEAKER_01]: different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be green and red and orange and
yellow depending on what the nutrient was
[SPEAKER_01]: that we threw in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same principle with these
ICPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a leaf, it heats up the material
in that leaf to a really hot temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minerals glow and you can use that
spectrophotometer to see how much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: glow you have in certain color ranges and
spectra and that tells you how much of
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular element you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty slick process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the tissue ranges that we have are
derived from healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually not empirically derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is people don't go
out and do a lot of different experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put different rates of say
potassium and different rates of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and different rates of magnesium on the
soil and look and see how the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take tissue samples along that range and
then see what's optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too much work and too much detail
and too many interactions are possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time these numbers come
from plants that look healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing healthy, they look great,
they take a sample, we see what those
[SPEAKER_01]: values are and by doing that lots and lots
and lots of times we can kind of get a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of what those ranges are for
healthily growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we sample those leaves we want to
take them at a time when the leaf nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: values are stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when are leaf nutrient values stable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll talk about that in a second
because that depends on some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of measuring the values in
the leaves, everything works well with
[SPEAKER_01]: this ICP except for nitrogen and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different methods that exist to
measure nitrogen and sulfur in leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different ways of digesting the leaves to
pull out the nitrogen and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different tools used to measure the
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use colorimetric spectrum atomic
methods, we can use specific ion
[SPEAKER_01]: electrodes, we can stick it in the
solution and measure how much ammonium ion
[SPEAKER_01]: is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we can do some combustion and see what
results from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the values that you get for these
different methods are pretty closely
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated and so people don't worry too
much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur in particular, even though there
are differences with these methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's rare that you ever get a sulfur
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't worry about that so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nitrogen, it's pretty closely
correlated to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen comes in two different forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in this ammonium form,
an organic form which is biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: active, and then it comes in a nitrate
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the total of the nitrate and ammonium
form gives you the total amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the nitrate form that's not very
active in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moved into the plant but it's not
really converted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be converted into products that
are biologically active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really when we measure nitrogen in a
leaf, we really want to know how much NH4
[SPEAKER_01]: plus is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a biologically active form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But determining that is pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nitrate concentration in plants is
generally pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly just in the xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes the cheapest way to do it is
just look at total nitrogen and assume
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really highly correlated or almost
the same as ammonium biologically active
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what most leaf analysis is
based on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of error for
nitrogen and the same with sulfur,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't worry about it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of these leaf values most stable in
one of the sample leaves, well we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do it when the plants are growing
rapidly because the levels are fluctuating
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place and nutrients are
moving around to growing points and things
[SPEAKER_01]: just aren't stable when plants are growing
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly when they're fruiting the
values are jumping all over the place
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got a lot of export of
things like potassium from leaves to fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: and fruit expansion and so things are
fluctuating all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to find times when there's not
a lot of rapid growth and there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of fruit expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for strawberries the best time seems to
be after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of that renovation time when the new
leaves start to grow out of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: after renovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a lot of rapid growth in
strawberry in the spring and of course
[SPEAKER_01]: they fruit right away and so none of those
times in May, June and July are really
[SPEAKER_01]: very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But August, early August is usually a good
time, late July when those new leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us a good indication of the
nutrient status of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberries, whether it's summer bearing
or fall bearing raspberries, that August
[SPEAKER_01]: time slot seems to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most rapid growth happens in the
spring for both summer and fall fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The summer bearing raspberries are pretty
much done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fall bearing raspberries haven't
started yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we sample leaves from the
primocanes, not the floricanes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the primocanes in early August,
that's a good time to sample because value
[SPEAKER_01]: is stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same way with blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit's already expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might still have fruit in the plant but
we don't have a lot of expansion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit at that time and most of the growth
is stopped at that time so August is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good time to sample for those too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we select the most recently mature
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we select older leaves, those were
growing during a time of rapid growth or
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit expansion so the values there might
not be representative but the recently
[SPEAKER_01]: matured leaves at those times are the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect about 30 to 50 leaflets without
the petioles because the petioles sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute what's in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want the lamina of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Randomly sample the area that you're going
to be interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either do it as a diagnostic basis
where I'm going to just sample from plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that look sick to see what's wrong or
routine is just I want to see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: health of this plant is so you just
randomly go through the area and pick 50
[SPEAKER_01]: leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the young leaves exposed to sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get those leaves,
it's best to wash them off in distilled
[SPEAKER_01]: water to get rid of the dust or soil that
might have splashed in the leaf or
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicide residue because a lot of
fungicides have elements in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: metal elements in them so I'm going to
wash those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can just go into a paper bag and
dry for a couple of days and then they can
[SPEAKER_01]: be sent to a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people send us samples that they try
to preserve them, green and almost put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a press and press them down and
all and send them with some moisture in a
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dry them as soon as we get
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might as well go ahead and dry them
anyway and it's easier to handle that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several advantages to this for
their testing and I alluded to them
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standardization of analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have this difference from lab to
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send leaves to one lab, you get
results back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ought to be the same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really close to it as another lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the recommendations might be different
and we'll talk about those in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar but the numbers ought to be pretty
much the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better indicator of nutrient status than a
soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I like about it is it can
identify potential problems before they
[SPEAKER_01]: result in visible symptoms or reduced
growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like the cholesterol test of
your blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can detect high cholesterol before you
know anything's even wrong with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: before you have that heart attack or heart
immunity arteries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can help diagnose a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see something that doesn't look
right in your field, off-color,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants aren't growing well, you don't
think it's a virus or you just don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is, you can just sample from that
area and at least get a sense of whether
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question on how do you suggest
to dry the sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you have to do anything
special to dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it in a bag and leave it in a
window seal or just send it in the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on a radiator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it just has to be dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't want it to get them all in a
plastic bag where it's really wet and they
[SPEAKER_01]: start to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several shortcomings of
foliar testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is, these aren't real big
shortcomings but you should be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides the total amount of an
element, not the amount that is in a
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically active form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for certain mineral elements we have
biologically active and inactive forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is one of those, it's probably the
most important of the mineral elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It occurs in two forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had high school chemistry or
college chemistry, you might remember that
[SPEAKER_01]: iron is a divalent ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in two forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a plus two form and a plus three
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: In plants, it's the plus two form that's
active and not the plus three form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally we want to know when we measure
iron how much iron is in the plus two
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ICP doesn't tell us that,
it just tells us what the total amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: iron is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are situations where we can see
that iron levels look like they're high or
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate but really we have symptoms of
iron chlorosis because most of the iron is
[SPEAKER_01]: not in the correct form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about this two webinars ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about blueberries in high
calcium soils, how the calcium pushes a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the iron in the plant to the plus
three form where it's not really active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a blueberry plant showing iron
chlorosis you might see that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate iron but really you still have
iron chlorosis because it's not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other shortcoming is that we're
sampling at one time of the year when the
[SPEAKER_01]: values of these nutrients tend to be the
most stable but that might not be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal time for all elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be for certain elements that it's
better to sample first thing in the spring
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe going into the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's too expensive to do these
samplings over multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way the ICP analysis works,
it does all the nutrients at one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just runs it through and they get a
printout of everything at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like we do each element
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each time we do a test it's expensive,
you know, it's $20 to $30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to be doing that multiple
times during the season unless you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the standards have been
developed for just those times of the year
[SPEAKER_01]: that we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might not be ideal for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then thirdly, it doesn't mean that if
you do a leaf test, a foliar test,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can avoid doing a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still need that soil test to be
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next webinar will give you some
examples of how just looking at a foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: test you can maybe draw some wrong
conclusions until you look at that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked in previous webinars about
how the pH has a big impact on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: These foliar tests are really only good if
the soil pH is within the range that we
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another shortcoming of a foliar analysis
is it doesn't really measure interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: among elements that can affect activity
and bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know, for example, that potassium is
really high in a plant, it can reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: activity of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a leaf analysis might show that
magnesium is adequate, but if the
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium is really high that magnesium
activity might be suppressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't behave as if magnesium is
adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other well-known interactions are iron and
phosphorus, zinc and phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we already mentioned calcium and iron,
how they're antagonistic, particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries when we're trying to grow
things at a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another question, Mervin,
on pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should the soil pH be sampled at the
same time as the leaves, or do you just
[SPEAKER_00]: use your most recent soil test?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use your most recent soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil pH isn't going to change that
much over a period of months unless you've
[SPEAKER_01]: added a lot of lime or sulfur recently,
but just your standard soil test,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be pretty much the same in
the spring as it is in fall as it would
[SPEAKER_01]: even be the next year when you do your
leaf analysis in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your most recent soil test will be
adequate for determining that range that
[SPEAKER_02]: you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: A caveat when we're talking about these
nutrients and deficiencies and all is that
[SPEAKER_01]: usually more than one nutrient is
deficient at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty unusual just to see one by
itself, although you can see it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but oftentimes conditions that induce
deficiencies impact more than just one
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a simple example would be a high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put on too much lime and you kick
that pH up too high, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneous deficiencies of iron,
manganese, copper, bronze, zinc,
[SPEAKER_01]: and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of essential elements in
plants, and they're all important because
[SPEAKER_01]: they all carry out functions that are
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to read through all
these, but you can glance at the chart and
[SPEAKER_01]: see that, wow, there's a lot of things
that happen in a plant biochemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these elements have big impacts on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pointing out potassium is the only one
that's not really incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really part of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of cell structure very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly used for osmoregulation and
for catalyzing enzyme reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 50 enzymes in a plant are
activated by potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps open and close stomates,
so it's really important in
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not incorporated into parts of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these other ones are incorporated
to some extent, molybdenum, mostly for
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme activation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of interesting to look and
see how the plants have evolved to use
[SPEAKER_01]: these essential elements in so many
diverse ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all kind of works together and
makes sense, and plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other essential nutrients that weren't on
that chart were molybdenum, chlorine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and nickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were among the most recently
discovered essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't really know they were
critical until fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're only really necessary in very
small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the amounts are so small that
experimentally, it was actually hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow plants in media that didn't contain
at least a tiny amount of nickel or
[SPEAKER_01]: molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain other plants, not all plants,
sodium, selenium, cobalt, and silicon are
[SPEAKER_01]: essential nutrients, but not in the berry
crops we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't worry about those four,
except maybe selenium and sodium in
[SPEAKER_01]: situations where we have too much in toxic
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we have zero of those, we never
would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But theoretically, if we would,
it wouldn't make an impact on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This chart here shows the relative
concentrations of the various nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and atoms in healthy plant tissue relative
to nickel and molybdenum, which if there
[SPEAKER_01]: was one atom of nickel and one atom of
molybdenum, we would have about two of
[SPEAKER_01]: cobalt, 100 of copper, 300 of zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can read through that all the way
up to where we're getting into like nickel
and molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen, where we'd have a million atoms
of nitrogen for every atom of molybdenum
[SPEAKER_01]: or nickel, 30 million oxygen, 40 million
carbon, 60 million hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the challenges in leaf analysis
is a test that measures concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: across such a wide range of like a
million-fold range of nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're fortunate that we have
technology that allows us to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cheaply as we do for nutrients across
such a wide, wide range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visual symptoms of deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, certain nutrients are extremely
mobile in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this characteristic can help diagnose
the visual symptoms that you might see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are five nutrients that are
really very mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since they're mobile, they will tend to
move out of the leaf into the phloem and
[SPEAKER_01]: into the growing points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you recall, the xylem is what pulls
water into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with it, it pulls in some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up the xylem into the leaf where
all this biochemical activity happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugars are made through photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the nutrients and amino acids
that are made, the nutrients that need to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the growing points are pumped out
through the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go preferentially to the growing
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see a plant that has odd colors
and old leaves, but the new leaves seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be healthy, the vigorous is just these old
leaves are turning yellow or doing funky
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost always a deficiency in NPK,
magnesium, or sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see the opposite, if we see the
young leaves showing deficiencies in the
[SPEAKER_01]: old leaves not, that usually implies it's
one of the other nutrients because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: less mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll look at some pictures of these
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to show you some sap values of
substances that when you squeeze a sap out
[SPEAKER_01]: of a plant, what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is separated based on xylem sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phloem sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And xylem is what comes in from the roots
and goes up through the plant into the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the phloem is what comes out of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at a few of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at sugars to begin with,
just to give you a feel for how the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't take sugar out of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's zero sugar in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it leaves the leaf in the phloem,
there's lots of sugar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the water's coming up through the
xylem into the phloem, into the leaf where
[SPEAKER_01]: the sugars are made, and then that's
pumped out the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see those big differences between
xylem and phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talked the last few webinars about nitrate
as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of xylem versus the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you fertilize a plant with nitrate
sources of nitrogen, the nitrate goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's dissolved in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes right into the plant,
up through the root, into the vascular
[SPEAKER_01]: system, into the leaf, at fairly high
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes out of the leaf,
there's none of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrate doesn't move through the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in the leaf, it's converted
through nitrate reductase into amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: and ammonia compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: NH4 compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes out of the leaf,
what we see are values over here being
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up here, amino acids, NH4,
but not nitrate itself, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion happens in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some work on determining
nitrogen needs by measuring the petiole
[SPEAKER_01]: sap concentrations of nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have heard about petiole nitrate
analysis, the petiole sap analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people are trying to do is they're
trying to look at this value here,
[SPEAKER_01]: determine the nitrogen needs of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done this with strawberry,
particularly, to see if it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they can get correlations with the
total nitrogen needs of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a few problems with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, this isn't the type of nitrogen
that the plant uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant uses this type of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that nitrate isn't going to the
growing point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's coming in, but it's not
necessarily going out of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this really the best indicator of
the plant's nutritional status?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a measure of nitrogen availability,
but not necessarily nitrogen use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily correlated with
the active form of nitrogen when we look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the sap concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that happens is the
concentration is really dependent on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flow of water in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after it rains, the value of nitrate in
the xylem is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it starts to dry out and the
plant's not taking up as much water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentration of nitrate goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a day-to-day basis, those values in
the sap and the xylem change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to say whether
something's deficient or not, or it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: more nitrogen, just based on these
snapshot pictures at one point in time in
[SPEAKER_01]: this really variable concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for certain crops, this petiole
analysis people were using it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in corn and some of the annual crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in perennial crops, it hasn't really
caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because each time you take a sample,
you've got to run an expensive test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always correlated in this
variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention that,
because you probably have heard of it
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to these ranges for sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if we look at the xylem phosphorus,
we see that it comes into the plant at a
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly low concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes out of the leaf into the phloem at
a fairly high concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus is fairly mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in, it's accumulated in the leaf,
and it's sent out at high concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: to the growing points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is a very mobile nutrient in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same as potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is really mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes into the plant through being
dissolved in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes into the plant, goes up to the
xylem, into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's concentrated in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a great extent, it's sent out to phloem
at a high concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these growing points, the filling
of fruit, this is all really intensive for
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It plays a big role in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see high concentrations in the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes into the plant through dissolved
water through mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes out to phloem at even lower
concentrations and it comes into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: through the dissolved water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a very mobile nutrient in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look for deficiencies of
calcium, we see calcium deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: develop at the extremities of the plant
where it just doesn't move through very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't move through that phloem and
gets to the extremities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't move through the plant very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a very mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start looking at some of these
photographs and see if we can't figure
[SPEAKER_01]: something out based on the plant and the
behavior of the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something fairly simple, a blueberry
here, a plant with adequate nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a plant with inadequate nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are trained enough,
they can look at the color of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can say, well, that green just
tells me that there's not enough nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaves are smaller, they tend to
be yellower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some plants, like strawberry,
the leaf color is a little bit more red
[SPEAKER_01]: than light green in more advanced stages
of nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a field of strawberries that was
sort of abandoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower didn't renovate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hadn't probably fertilized it since
last year at renovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the leaves are starting to show
this reddish, yellowish, light green color
[SPEAKER_01]: indicating nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is a deficiency that mimics
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is a component of amino acids just
like nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulk of nitrogen is in amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the two are actually in parallel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both are comprised amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that sulfur is needed in a lot
lower amount than nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned earlier, sulfates and
sulfur are pretty ubiquitous around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our soils have sulfates in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of sulfur in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in an area where there's
deposition of sulfur in the rainfall
[SPEAKER_01]: because we still burn coal and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sulfur dioxide floats over the
northeast and when it rains, sulfur comes
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilizers contain sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though we don't measure it really,
after a while and a lot of the soil tests
[SPEAKER_01]: don't show sulfur even on the result,
usually we just don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd only be in situations where the soils
are real sandy and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might run into a sulfur deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the symptoms look very similar to what
they look like if nitrogen was deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the principle of the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short on amino acids and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorous deficiency, it's pretty
similar in most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They develop the same kind of symptoms
with phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first sign is usually the leaves turn
a dark green or they get this dark red
[SPEAKER_01]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see on the margins of the
leaves mild deficiencies that just starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop along the edges, this dark
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the whole leaf will get dark
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on blueberry, again, just a darker
color than would be normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just sort of tell when you look at
that plant that it's more than just too
[SPEAKER_01]: much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a darker green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, when you look at the leaf,
you'll see that phosphorus is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't usually have too much phosphorus
deficiency in our soils in the northeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly because there are a lot of
dairy farms around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people spread manure and manure has a
lot of phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the rocks have a lot of
phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that common that I see a leaf
analysis come back where phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_01]: really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's adequate or maybe close to
being low, but not really seriously
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this nutrient here, potassium,
we do see deficiency symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is of course strawberry and the first
sign of deficiency is often a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of browning where the leaflet attaches to
the petiole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaf gets a little blotchy here
and you can see over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dark green in places, it's light
green in places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as time goes on, you get a little
bit more marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can see along the edge you
get this marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the darker color, the lighter
color, and then marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very indicative of potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since potassium is a very mobile
nutrient in the plant, you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms developing on the older leaves
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same will be true with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older leaves first because it's a
mobile nutrient within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out in the field, potassium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that marginal burning is very
indicative of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: As these leaves are very low in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a common symptom in almost every
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's look at what calcium
deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you recall, I said that calcium
does not move very well in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can move through the plant in two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come up through the xylem,
move into the leaf, or it can be pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: through the phloem into the growing
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem here is that growing points
themselves, when calcium is in short
[SPEAKER_01]: supply, the calcium just doesn't get out
to the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real distinctive calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the growing points turning brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have enough calcium here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not enough calcium getting
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't move through the phloem very
well anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have cloudy, humid conditions,
it doesn't move through the xylem very
[SPEAKER_01]: well either because transpiration is shut
down whenever it's cool and cloudy and
[SPEAKER_01]: humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not sucking water into the plant
and bringing calcium in through mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't move through the phloem
very well anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the growing points are the first things
that suffer when calcium is in short
[SPEAKER_01]: supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's not a very mobile
nutrient, we also see it on the new growth
[SPEAKER_01]: first before we see it on the old growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a new leaf coming out of a
strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already impacted by low calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already turning brown and black,
and it hasn't even emerged yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older leaves on the strawberry plant
would have been fine because they already
[SPEAKER_01]: got their calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium doesn't move out a leaf,
so they're hanging onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they look fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these new leaves under the short
calcium supply show the symptoms because
[SPEAKER_01]: the calcium is not remobilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we see a runner tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another common place where you'll
see calcium deficiency showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this necrosis of the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the runners are way out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for calcium to get out that far
along this runner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see symptoms showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is similar to calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both a bivalent cation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But magnesium is more mobile in the plant
than calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't quite have that same
tendency to show up in the newer growth
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: But magnesium in almost all plants shows a
pretty distinctive symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is you get interveinal coloring
and eventually browning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on this blueberry plant, we can see
that the color between the veins is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of red and the veins stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very common in plants with magnesium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green veins, discolored interveinal areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing to think of is magnesium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call this sort of the Christmas
tree pattern because it's got the green
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a Christmas tree and in
between is red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have the beginnings of magnesium
deficiency on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike blueberry, we don't get that really
strong red color in between the veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do get interveinal coloring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on the veins, but in between the
veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go to a little bit more severe
situation, we can see that in between the
[SPEAKER_01]: veins actually turn brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But almost any time you see this
interveinal browning into nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency, you know that's magnesium
because that's how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, Jeff from Oneida County had a
question going back to calcium deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: on the strawberries and whether I think
the first picture you showed showed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of cupping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a symptom of the calcium
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because out here at the corners of the
edges, you know, those leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: those cells there just haven't developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the leaf wants to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tips of the leaflet are still not
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant tried, the back part here
tries to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This part doesn't want to go along with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with these cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which again, symptomatic of low calcium in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily mean that there's
low calcium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that it's not getting into
the leaf and getting out to those tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often this is a symptom of inadequate
irrigation or off and on again irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to low calcium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll talk more about that next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't tell you what it is just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a real good example of how a
nutrient deficiency develops in the
[SPEAKER_01]: younger leaves first.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new younger leaves coming out where
the older leaves, you know, don't show the
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not a very mobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it stays in the old leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those new leaves that come out are wanting
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to get it from the
older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they stay yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very classic symptoms of iron deficiency
is just general yellowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is between the veins like
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a little bit different look to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veins stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: This interveinal area is very yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sort of a red or a light green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just yellow, which indicates that
it's probably iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cold springs, blueberries have purple
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that doesn't indicate a nutrient
deficiency usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just cold temperature and
chlorophyll development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually as soon as the weather warms up,
that dark color goes away and the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: appear normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is often mistaken for
phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people see that red color in the
spring, they think, oh, it's phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just plants just need to warm up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close up of iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairly common when blueberries are planted
in high pH soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manganese deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see this as much or very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also appears on younger leaves first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much like iron in terms of its
mobility in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are just some examples of what it
might look like on a strawberry leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: a raspberry leaf, black currant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's almost like iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, you might assume it was iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these things aren't perfectly
distinctive from one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we do a fuller analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps us tell apart what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know something's not right,
but you can't always tell by the visual
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do see manganese deficiency
occasionally, particularly when the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find a good photograph of zinc
deficiency for berry crops, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly common.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's common in tree fruit crops,
particularly in sandier soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it on apples and citrus,
particularly citrus where it's grown on
[SPEAKER_01]: sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also call it little leaf disease just
because the leaves don't get as big as
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to or should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also see some interveinal
yellowing with zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one we do see quite a bit in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Availability of boron is quite variable in
our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run into situations where it can be
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's one of the only
micronutrients that we test for,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in strawberries because it
can be low, and it's an important nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is blueberry, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a big grower in Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of low bush blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kept telling me he always had
winter injury in his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, it does look like winter
injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a particularly mild winter,
he called up and said, I still have winter
[SPEAKER_01]: injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had good snow cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron was really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We applied boron over his fields the next
year, no problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dieback is very characteristic of
boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this dieback here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a root system of a strawberry
plant that has all the nutrients it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown in a water solution,
hence the proliferation of roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next picture I'm going to show you
is the root system grown without boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that root tips are really
stubby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because boron is responsible
for oxen production, which stimulates root
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have good oxen activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, you don't have good cell
expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get these stubby little root tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, roots like this don't do a
very good job of taking up other nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another characteristic of boron deficiency
is asymmetrical leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like on this leaf over here,
you see the leaflet tends to be smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: than normal anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you often see this asymmetry,
whereas in normal leaves with adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition, you don't get that asymmetry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a real severe case where the
leaves just fail to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't have the cell elongation
that we would normally get when there's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough oxygen present in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the strawberry fruit itself,
the little achines here excrete oxen,
[SPEAKER_01]: which cause the receptacle tissue
underneath to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the strawberry fruit grows and
turns into a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these little achines aren't producing
oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get that expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fruit becomes deformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that impacts these little
achines, whether it be frost, which kills
[SPEAKER_01]: the achine, the growing embryo,
or tarnished plant bug feeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: or low boron, are going to give you these
deformed fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you just saw this, you wouldn't
really know which of those three it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you do a poor pollination or
maybe those four things, a leaf analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: could tell you whether it might be boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least you could rule it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have any more toxicity pictures
to show you, deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a warning for you not to be
fooled because herbicide toxicity symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: often resemble nutrient deficiency
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I have a picture of some plants
that have been affected by herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Roundup.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Simazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Sinbar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Solicam.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture here is actually June
yellows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a phytoplasm that impacts certain
varieties of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes them to turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I wanted to do is just show you
that just because you see that yellowing,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't automatically assume that it's a
nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But check on the history of the herbicide
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also possible it might be this
phytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you have patterns that you look
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbicide injury usually occurs in a
regular pattern in a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it often at the end of rows where
the tractors that's spraying the herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: slows down to make a turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a little bit more
herbicide than you wanted at the end of a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, every third row where the
sprayer might overlap with the pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that overlap is you get some injury
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen herbicide damage near wet areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while to figure out what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was going on, they were spraying
the herbicide when it was wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the tractor got into that wetter
area, the wheel started to spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tractor slowed down, but the rate of
herbicide coming out the sprayer was the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always right to the side of these wet
spots, you see these herbicide injury
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was from that sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look for patterns with herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the herbicide injury has a rapid
onset, whereas the nutrient deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: usually develop more slowly and often
follow the soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is don't just automatically
assume it's a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it looks like those pictures I
just showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I wanted to point out that
over-fertilization can result in injury
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some photographs of some strawberry
plants that have been over-fertilized with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this photograph here, too much
ammonium nitrogen fertilizer the same way
[SPEAKER_01]: with this photograph here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down here we have too much boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you get symptoms that almost look
like potassium deficiency, but actually in
[SPEAKER_01]: this case here it's too much boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here, too much zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it looks like it's a deficiency,
but really if you overdo it you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same problem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up here, some of this chlorosis that
might look like phosphorus deficiency is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually too much copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be really careful just
using visual assessments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my take-home message is that visual
symptoms of nutrient deficiencies are
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to diagnose and can be confused
with many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One should try to address these
nutritional problems before visual
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you start to see the visual
symptoms, you know darn well that yield
[SPEAKER_01]: has been affected and plant growth has
been affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, a foliar elemental analysis is
the best technology we can currently have
[SPEAKER_01]: for assessing plant nutrient status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the next webinar we're going to be
actually looking at some of the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: that come off of these foliar tests and
seeing if we can interpret them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully with the understanding
you've gotten today with how these
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients move in the plant and how they
interact, you will be better able to
[SPEAKER_01]: interpret these foliar tests that we're
going to look at in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the end of my formal remarks
and presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to type in some questions,
we still have a few minutes to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with some answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like anyone's typing,
so I assume that means people are
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding it and are comfortable with
the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan, are you still out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can maybe come on and say a few words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we do have one question there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the question is does excess zinc
look like iron deficiency because the zinc
[SPEAKER_01]: is interfering with iron uptake or is it
just coincidence?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly possible that since they're
both divalent cations that zinc and iron
[SPEAKER_01]: could be interfering with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one of those common antagonisms
that have been written about or studied,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I imagine that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have someone else typing here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These interactions in plants are not that
well studied, particularly in buried
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few people have looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of unanswered questions
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the best time and which leaves
should be taken for strawberry tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned earlier, right after
renovation, when those new leaves come up
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the ground after harvest,
that's usually late July, maybe early
August.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's the best time for
strawberry tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it doesn't look like there's any
other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of quick reminders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next webinar will be on December 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been originally scheduled for next
week, but will be on the 16th,
[SPEAKER_00]: again at two o'clock in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the first time you've joined us
for one of our webinars and haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: completed our demographic form or the
educator pretest, those are available as
[SPEAKER_00]: downloads under that file box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could please complete those,
we would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can send those to Kathy
Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for joining us this
afternoon and we'll see you on the 16th.
