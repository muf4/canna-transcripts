[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had a good week this week,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the kids to Yankee Stadium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took our turf class to Yankee Stadium
with some additional people interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 25 people we took down to
visit my old college pal, Dan Cunningham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you've been down there with
me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminded me of when I taught at
Madison, I used to take them up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Lambeau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had pictures of the class at the
center of Lambeau.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the train.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a bus down to Yankee Stadium and
then got on the subway and went down to
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Park and visited Zach Holm,
who's the director of turf care at Central
[SPEAKER_00]: Park, did some grass ID of the rye grass
and poet in the field there and then hung
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit at Sheeps Meadow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, that was Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, we got up and went out to Delhi,
SUNY Delhi, where we had a walk and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting the apprenticeship program that
the New York State Turfgrass Association
[SPEAKER_00]: is working on with a bunch of the
superintendent organizations, Tyler
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom's outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are about a thousand students
pursuing apprenticeships in greenkeeping
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds management in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to meet and see some of the
students at Delhi doing projects on the
[SPEAKER_00]: golf course, got to interact with Tom
Kaufman, who's been the superintendent
[SPEAKER_00]: there for many, many years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a great visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we got to see some robotic
mowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: M.T.E.
[SPEAKER_00]: was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Matt Simon, former superintendent
now selling robots for M.T.E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very interesting because,
you know, from a workforce perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, automation and apprenticeship
skills are going to be very, very
important in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to be teaching
apprenticeships, those apprenticeships
[SPEAKER_00]: better be teaching technological skills
because a lot of what these folks are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be doing is going to be involving
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, assumedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this generation, younger generation,
will be more comfortable integrating
[SPEAKER_00]: technology into their work life.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you know, Carl, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on time for a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was literally sitting there like,
OK, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl's not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all those years, I've been late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we got dog pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a shout out for the cats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not a big cat guy, but I got
three barn cats and cats have their
[SPEAKER_00]: usefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very interested in you,
per se, but they are interested in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that bother you around your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my man, Will Benson, with my
absolute favorite dog in the entire golf
[SPEAKER_00]: turf industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will is the superintendent at Laurelwood
Golf Club, little nine hole muni in
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is Sandy the Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to watch Sandy cruise the golf course
is something that is worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, to the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cooler last week, and now we're
starting to see a switch change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about normal between three to seven
days of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go into the highest
elevations up in the Adirondacks and up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Green Mountains and into Maine,
where you're more than a week behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly those areas are a little bit
behind normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody else, especially with the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have this conversation next week,
you're probably going to see most people
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bjarni Harnson tweeted a great picture of
early spring grass growth in Iceland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case anybody thinks their spring is
slow to emerge, there's always Iceland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if we've proposed to buy
this place yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're planning on buying the other
joint, but for now, looking at the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: types here, obviously Bjarni is saying
those first two rows there are creeping
[SPEAKER_00]: vent grass completely straw brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next plot, fescue and colonial vent
grass, then the row of straight fescue,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the row of straight colonial vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this thing, we talk about
vent being slow in the northeastern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug, you probably talk about it with
Chris Zuegel along the lake, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do a lot of things to get
the vent grass growing and probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: the best grass for Iceland guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been to Iceland, Doug?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
Never?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bjarni's got to get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're progressing slowly in
the touch points of spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is a good time to get a broadleaf
herbicide out in the spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never ideal to do it at this time,
but this is a good benchmark of when you
[SPEAKER_00]: might get an amine or an ester formulation
of a broadleaf weed control product to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide some measure of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not ideal for sure, fall being a
much better time, but you can also pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: some winter annuals, as Randy Prostak
tells us a twofer, where you might get
[SPEAKER_00]: some winter annuals before they flower and
get some of the perennial broadleaf weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from old work at Purdue from many,
many years ago, back in the Throssell
[SPEAKER_00]: Riker days, the ancient days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is if we're getting ready
to spray weeds, it means some of the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are beginning to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our pollinator risk assessment,
which you can see with this map,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really sort of tracking when you
shouldn't be spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it becomes ideal, if you look here,
as it's becoming ideal for these herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, it's also becoming risky for
the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use these products,
mow the flowers off as best as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the flowers aren't there, the bees
aren't going to be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of visitors to lawns in the
spring, especially with the winter annuals
[SPEAKER_00]: and the spring ephemerals like lesser
selendine that might be flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are still cool in some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in those high elevations,
you're in the 40s, and then you go down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philly area, and you're in the mid
60s, and Long Island in the upper 50s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are trigger points now for where
many of your root pathogen fungicide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications will go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd encourage you to keep monitoring your
soil temperature and determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have Ming Yi on the show at
some point this spring to discuss some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the new root pathogens that he is actively
finding with his new molecular techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is obviously going to shape the way
we do control in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, pretty dry last week,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most areas got very little rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go up along the Great Lakes and
northern areas to get the rainfall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rainfall's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the forecast with precip minus
evapotranspiration, and you can see we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have an excess of water in some
of these areas, and we have another risk
[SPEAKER_00]: model on the forecast website that
indicates when that rain comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are parts of the region that are at
risk for runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, we put our pres down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our broadleafs down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our root pathogen materials down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're putting a broadleaf down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're putting a fertilizer down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to put a lot of things on the land
in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring the runoff at this time of year
is really critical just to get a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: days you should avoid, and you can find
all this at the forecast website.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're getting to it now,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple of guys posting about rolling
fairways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you how much this warms my
heart to see people rolling more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to take up this topic of
traffic and rolling and organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know Carl's got a few things
we're going to chat with you about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the sort of theme for today is
traffic, and it's something that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you did some work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to want you to speculate and
extrapolate from where you did those
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds of golf in those plots,
right, with those fertilizer rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that from years ago when you did
that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's rolling, Jim Pavanetti
style at Fairview, and here's rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: Meadowbrook, John Carlone style on Long
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, wide units rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's starting to see the benefits
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The obstacle has been it takes too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to use a tractor,
blah, blah, blah, but look what's pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are utility carts now with very wide
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can get the big Trimax one that
Beth Page has got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to use a tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting into the big heavyweights,
and very few people, to my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: have sort of studied different rollers on
fairways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure Nicolaes even studied fairway
rolling, but Doug, here's something
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Giordano did this work back in 2013,
right, where he had a native soil and he
[SPEAKER_00]: had a USGA root zone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What came out of this is rolling reduces
infiltration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my first question to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at a graph here where I've
drawn a line at 20 centimeters per hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what, an inch?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 10 inches an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 inches, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 inches an hour, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will hear people say,
oh, rolling reduces infiltration,
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight times a week rolling a root zone
still keeps it at 10 inches an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is, do you care?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it reduces it if it's still 10 inches
an hour?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just means you can't play during
Hurricane Katrina, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna have to take a day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your mind, as long, you know,
eight times a week on a proper root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: still provides enough infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a different question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the native soils that even at
eight times a week are at 10 centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: which is five inches an hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get worried there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and that's native, but it's gotta be a
sand top, sand cap, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we build sand greens is
because we don't care about compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're gonna have to manage
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna be the thing that you're
gonna wanna manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these reductions, even though they're
statistically significant or you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences, they don't matter in terms of
real life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking root zones, Carl,
and I know we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and it comes from the great
grassroots Wisconsin golf course
[SPEAKER_00]: superintendents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug, I think sometimes this is the only
place you put this stuff, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You squirrel it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody isn't, you know, honored like
I am to receive this monthly for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 frigging years and writing for it for
many years in my time there, I come across
[SPEAKER_00]: this article, I rip it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's on my desk and Carl's
like, Carl, you gotta look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's sitting there taking a picture like
it's 1970, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta read this thing like it's 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Carl, fire away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Doug, maybe you could just set up what
this research was.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different volumes of top dressing
over three years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So different volumes of top dressing,
different frequencies at which those
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes were applied and then different
sands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you could set some of it up
before we get into the nitty gritty here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys make my slides for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a USDA green.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to know, hey, what database
management is what we're really interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, let's start to use some data to
make some top dressing decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much sand should we put down down
the year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the particle size of the sand matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if we apply it weekly, is it any
different than monthly?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're interested in firmness as
being something that we're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized there's all kinds of
different firmness meters out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to see what we got from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And surprisingly, first of all,
fine sand versus standard sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of guys are switching to fine sands
because they think that it's gonna give
[SPEAKER_02]: them a firmer surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look across the sand size
category in the middle there, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: see any differences at all, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that surprised us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you do see the GS3 ball picked up
on the fine sand actually being softer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other four devices didn't pick up
any difference at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things was like,
well, these devices are doing different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're showing us different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one should we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have a great answer for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically what we're finding is a lot
of these decisions didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see tiny differences here,
but the amount of sand you put down,
[SPEAKER_02]: some devices you saw small differences,
other devices you saw nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: The frequency, like very, very few of
these decisions influenced firmness,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was surprising to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other surprising thing,
Doug, and I don't have the organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe I do in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I do, Frank, but you
definitely saw the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to be 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top one, yeah, talk about that,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically the only thing that
mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quality didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these things didn't affect
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't affect growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't affect ball roll speed,
tiny differences in firmness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only thing that really showed up
was these decisions do affect the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of organic matter in your top inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we put down the least amount of
sand, we had the most amount of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would have thought, hey,
that's going to be a softer green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we put down the most sand,
we got the least amount of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be firmness.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the USGA is the most amount of
sand and the paste turf is the least
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of scan across there and
see, and look for those differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Doug, the relative amounts of sand
were pretty different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that USGA was something like,
I don't know, double or cubic feet per
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Michael Woods method was like a
third of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the USGA method, which was about 20,
25, 26 cubic feet per thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paste turf was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Woods was in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically twice as much sand from USGA
to paste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Woods was kind of in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a clipping volume way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought, hey, people are collecting
clipping volumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we match up sand with clipping
volume production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cool that it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it fell right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of the biggest differences
between the amount of sand, it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: USGA versus paste, which is a climate
based method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And USGA is just kind of, hey,
every month, every three weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: go out and put this amount of sand on
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's review the evidence here,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we're not missing
the lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to take apart three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is when you say fine sand,
you mean it meets USGA specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not meet USGA specifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's kind of like the sand they're
using at Rutgers, where it's got more fine
[SPEAKER_02]: sand than allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like grossly out of spec.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the stuff Jim Murphy has been
saying, yeah, this stuff is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have a negative impact on turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the higher fines helps the sand get
into the canopy of these more dense newer
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the theory was it's also potentially
going to make it firmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it did, I guess,
with, no, it didn't at all, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you thought, well, what does a fine
sand do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the difference wasn't related to water
content either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just, and the coefficient of
uniformity, which is kind of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: higher the CU, the firmer it is,
that fine sand had a higher CU.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the exact number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like 2.5 versus the
standard sand, which is a two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was pointing to this fine sand
should make it more firm, but it didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what my theory on this is like,
it's more about the plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the sand matters if there's not
a lot of roots or turf on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once that stuff gets involved,
I think the roots zone makes less of a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got more to, you know, we got more to
just one situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and the other thing before before we
leave this slide is, Doug, could you take
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute because you did a separate study
where you looked at how these different
[SPEAKER_00]: devices correlate to either surface
organic matter or soil moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I recall, could you review for the
folks watching and listening roughly you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you've got a clag, you've got a true
firm, you've got the PGA method where you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop a ball bearing and measure the
dimpled depth, and then you got GS3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was all the data from this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just looked at the correlation
between the other measurements we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we saw, and I don't have the slide
in front of me and I'm not gonna,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm just gonna talk in general,
the heavier devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be like the big clag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ball drop, the ones that put more
force tended to be better related to the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the lighter drops, which would be
the like the true firm, the little clag,
[SPEAKER_02]: the GS3 ball tended to be more correlated
with surface organic matter and turf grass
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and things like that, which kind
of makes sense to me those heavy drops are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting down into the deeper in the root
zone, the lighter drops are measuring more
[SPEAKER_02]: the the grass surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about what they measure and
thinking about what you found here,
[SPEAKER_00]: your theory is that the plant,
the soil moisture, which also includes the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is not as maybe, you know,
I'm trying to figure out how once the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant gets involved, it's absorbing most
of what we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about when you're,
as you're putting force down on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface, the first thing the ball hits is
the grass and the thatch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it gets through that,
it starts to be absorbed by the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil strength is influenced by the
moisture of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do a real light drop,
it really doesn't have a chance that the
[SPEAKER_02]: grass and the thatch absorb it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a real heavy drop, you still get
the grass thatch interacting, but then it
[SPEAKER_02]: pushes down and maybe you get a signal
into the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to ask them about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now I want to ask you about the
organic matter model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the funniest part about this research
is you would have predicted firmness goes
[SPEAKER_01]: up with more sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you were able to predict very
accurately was how organic matter changed
[SPEAKER_01]: over three years with just this model that
has been sort of sitting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about like this Ohio State
organic matter model and how is it so
[SPEAKER_01]: good?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you even put into it to get it so
good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't do any, Ed McCoy at Ohio
State built this with Jeff Broadbilt of
[SPEAKER_02]: DryJex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gave those guys a hundred
percent of the credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they made me aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably six, seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built it into Greenkeeper and it's an
Excel spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how, when I go around and talk
about this to people, I just show the
[SPEAKER_02]: Excel spreadsheet and can I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, can I show my screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what you see with it is,
and it's kind of complicated, so I'll walk
[SPEAKER_02]: you through it, but it's based on
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic matter builds up in cold
environments because it doesn't break down
[SPEAKER_02]: as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a story about accumulation and
decay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blue line here, this is Madison,
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put in the weather data or the
climate data for Madison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's how average high is 26 degrees
in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Average low is 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just go down the line, you enter your
average high and your average low in
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it shows you, here's how your
organic matter accumulates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the grass roots growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's how it breaks down by the soil
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all a temperature thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, and then if we grew a warm season
grass in Madison, I wouldn't have to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about managing organic matter because my
decay is higher than my accumulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wouldn't have to worry about having
a job at a golf course because warm season
[SPEAKER_02]: grasses don't grow, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to tell what time of grass
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, we're all cool season people
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now let's go to, that's Madison,
let's go to Lake Placid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just grab the average highs and lows
in Lake Placid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just look at the factors here.
[SPEAKER_02]: For accumulation, we're about one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for decay, we peak around 0.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's Lake Placid gonna look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So peaks around one, you get a little less
accumulation because it's cooler there in
[SPEAKER_02]: June and September than Madison,
and you get way less decay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your accumulation of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got problems up in Lake Placid with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been up there to Lake Placid and seen
the fatch on the fairways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because the managers are
unskilled or they're doing something
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they just have a massive
amount of accumulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's go to Bethpage down on Long
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously very different climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, when people talk about growing
grass, you know, New York, it's all the
[SPEAKER_02]: same, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how different that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're accumulating and you're
accumulating different patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your decay is, you're getting,
you're matching your decay with your
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulation in July and August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing's happening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get the spring and fall
accumulation patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that, do you think that we should
be just top dressing everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: aerifying everything the same in New York
because it's New York, cool sea and grass?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the value of this model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can go, you enter your organic
matter contents here, maybe 5% at the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface, two and a half, one and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to send these into a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this follows the USGA's kind of,
you know, Organic Matter 246, Michael
[SPEAKER_02]: Woods has been promoting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't spend too much time on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you enter your organic matter,
you have your climate, then it predicts
[SPEAKER_02]: what your organic matter is going to look
like for the next five years based on your
[SPEAKER_02]: top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here at soil organic matter in the top
inch here at Bethpage, you can see it's
[SPEAKER_02]: slowly increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's based on these top dressing
aeration events that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look over here, it says top
dressings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if right now I put everything to zero,
so no top dressing, no dry ejecting,
[SPEAKER_02]: no hollow time, no solid time,
no deep fruity cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to go back down and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you stop doing everything down at
Bethpage, you're going to start at 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then five years later, 60 months,
you're going to be at 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not good, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to, we can use this model to
say, how much stuff do we need to do to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep our grass around 5%?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the questions we don't know
is, is 5% good?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about 6?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about 4?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, hey, 5 is kind of normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can add these top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you top dress once a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I used the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We top dress once a month starting in May,
June, July, August, September.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we do a hollow time event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, do a hollow time event in
October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes a surface top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the fine print of this model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back and see how that did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're still going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, again, like I'm not saying 6.5% is
bad, but we might have to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we put in two top dressings a month
early in the season, do something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go down and, oh, wait, that's too
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can back off on this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just, let's get rid of, get rid of
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get rid of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a planning tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still going down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all the guys who have to schedule
out member guests and men's leagues and
[SPEAKER_01]: women, by month, this is a really
effective tool to communicate either,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, if we don't do this, it's going to go
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or hey, maybe we can get rid of some of
these three of these hollow time events a
[SPEAKER_01]: year and can still maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's so accurate in your data,
we're talking about less than 0.05%,
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing I'll say about that is,
you know, when I show this off,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, great, it's a model.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it could be completely wrong,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just showing me dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we tested it, we did this study
for three or four years and we started at
[SPEAKER_02]: the start and we entered our top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like exactly on, like dead on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, it's going to be close or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, if you go, I'll stop sharing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me do one more thing before we
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now look at these operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bethpage, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got one top dressing in May,
two in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put this back on down to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start at five and by the end of five
years, if we're that aggressive,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just above four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to go back and we're going
to change that to Lake Placid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so same operations, different climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to go back here and it's
even it goes down even harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're down at three and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though those accumulation patterns
were those graphs were different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see you're probably not top
dressing in May in Lake Placid and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: do one here and maybe get rid of the
September one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go down and now we're at four now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So totally different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it as a planning tool and an
educational tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I like, I learned about it
is nothing happens below one inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we air fine down three inches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1030.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start that now, we're going to
be here for another hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't even get to growth and
traffic as traffic as a growth regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: and then looking at fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to know about top
dressing and measurement, you can do that.
You can do that.
You can do that.
You can do that.
You can do that.
You can do that.
That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just want to ask you one question,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It if you use that tool and you're looking
at organic matter, you just told me it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of doesn't even matter how I supply
this sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I supply enough, right,
enough, it's like the MLS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough, more isn't better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's gonna take us
years to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're really saying, as Carl said,
you can design your top dressing program
[SPEAKER_00]: around your events and not inconvenience
people if you just have to get a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount out based on your planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you more flexibility.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big picture takeaway was the
aggressive, the USGA method brought our
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter to 4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut that in half, we were at 6%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a superintendent, you're gonna
pick one, you're gonna put half the sand
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we need to find is what's too
much?
[SPEAKER_02]: 6% was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about 7?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about 8?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we really need to figure out
is where those thresholds lie.
So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Doug, thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, glad you could join us, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made it in time to get the modeling
stuff that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, see you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
