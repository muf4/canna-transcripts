[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a comparison of the
NRCS programs versus what we're doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: just Maryland, which has a pretty robust
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a collaboration with my PhD
advisor and with Dean Hively and some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks at USGS and ARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's developed out of a larger program
and we're just kind of trying to add value
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say that this was supported
by Northeast SARE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to anybody who's from SARE here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover crops are very regionally diverse
in their adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some areas, especially out in
the Midwest, where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: zero to one percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that these are zero to one
percent, one to five percent, five to ten
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see these red areas,
fifteen to fifty six percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where Maryland is leading the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really high adoption rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple other areas of the
country that, you know, localized pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Maryland is really the star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So already, this was my title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you, yes, they're
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the question is, how well are they
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the Northeast, we're especially
interested in protecting water quality
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the Chesapeake Bay,
largest estuary in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very ecologically and economically
valuable to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very densely populated,
as we know, as well as dense with
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's got ten billion
dollars of agricultural output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not something to
overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maryland is almost 100 percent in the
Chesapeake Bay watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was political will in Maryland to
really focus on protecting the bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about 10 years ago, a little bit
more, they came up with this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different from the way the NRCS
programs work in that it's available to
[SPEAKER_00]: every farmer every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's never a cap on how many
years you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are caps on how many acres,
but it's sort of like an enormous number
[SPEAKER_00]: for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is not so much to incentivize
like the real enthusiasts, it's to get
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the true believers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just money in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compared to the payments for equip in,
say, Indiana, this is twice the amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my first time seeing the New York
numbers that you just presented,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are comparable to these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a lot more money than a lot of
other states are providing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: NRCS programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers like this a lot more than,
you know, some of the other governmental
[SPEAKER_00]: programs about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Denmark, there are
mandatory cover crops and they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: much choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers like to get money instead of
just being told you have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the program works is the farmer
in the fall will make their plan for the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go to their soil water
conservation district and they'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I've got this many acres I'm going to
plant and this is how I'm going to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I'm going to terminate the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the species that I'm
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this information is entered into a
big database and then the payments are
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really simple compared to the
NRCS programs where there's like a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like just basically, did you plant
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you plant it by October 1st?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did, then you get this extra bump
in pay for being early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you plant it by the 15th?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you get a bump for being sort
of the standard planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's late planting after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really incentivize cereal rye because
it is just so much more productive than
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets an extra $10 bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the entire purpose of this
program is just water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just keeping nitrate out of the
Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legumes and legume mixes, which we're
all really enthusiastic about because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're cover crop, you know, true
believers, are not really incentivized in
[SPEAKER_00]: the program because that's adding nitrogen
to the soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sort of interesting thing is this
harvested column.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many years of the program,
but not this year, the program allowed you
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant a grass in the fall as long as
you did not fertilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the spring and then harvest it for
grain the following summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously wheat is a big option in
the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really enthusiastic about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first year that they are
cutting that side of the program out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get a lot less money for that,
but that's just sort of on top of I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably read somebody caught them
basically is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not super sure about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an update from the numbers that
we were just talking about, it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 and a half million dollars this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a good chunk of change,
especially because Maryland is a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively small state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this money wouldn't go that far
in, you know, say Iowa, but it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: far in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of questions that we want to
address in the project that I'm working on
[SPEAKER_00]: are, are these incentives working sort of
over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since the inception of the
program has adoption increased,
[SPEAKER_00]: are these cover crops capturing and
keeping it from getting into today and are
[SPEAKER_00]: the payouts sort of on the level with the
amount of benefit that we're getting out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to tackle that in a
couple different ways and talk about a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple different data sets that we have
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, spoiler alert,
are incentives working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they absolutely are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is acreage over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that now cover crop enrollment
has gotten to be the largest crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state on a given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is driven because of the
wheat program that, and the other small
[SPEAKER_00]: grain commodities that promote most of the
programs you were able to enroll those
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's also just, you know,
this is now, you know, 54% of our entire
[SPEAKER_00]: state crop land is covered under the
program in year, I think this is from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the 2017 data in this figure,
but it's, it just keeps going up every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the question is, you know,
what's the interaction between the timing
[SPEAKER_00]: of these various operations or the types
of management that people do and the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money that we're spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you know, average planting for
each field across all of the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is following corn in the orange
and following soybeans in the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the dates are very
clumped together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually, I have a pointer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the dates are clumped together here
where, you know, there's sort of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go up and they go up and then they
drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can imagine those are the crop
dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant by October 1st, you get an
extra $5, $10.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant by October 15th, you get an
extra $5, $10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the actual final date of the
program varies from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get kind of a trailing off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this real incentivization for
farmers to say, oh, I'm going to drop
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and make sure that I get it
planted on the very last day possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get that, you know,
money bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that pales in comparison to the fact
that they all want to kill it on the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first eligible date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not all, this was, you know,
like 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so come March 1st, they're all out
there spraying with a herbicide or tilling
[SPEAKER_00]: it under, disking it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to get it out of the field
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we, of course, want them to leave it
in the field for as long as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after, you know, that first 10%
of folks kill their cover crop on the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first day, then you have this kind of long
tail of, you know, when the various kill
[SPEAKER_00]: dates are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some people are going all the way
into May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the June and July is where we're
talking about the commodity crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the question is, you know,
over the years, have these incentives that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really want people to adopt,
have they increased in popularity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you recall that like early planting
gives you an extra 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would expect that, you know,
from the inception in 2004, when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: only offering, you know, $20 to now in
2016, where you can get a maximum of $75
[SPEAKER_00]: to get like all the possible bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are people going for that top rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is either, you know, early plantings
are actually going down, late plantings
[SPEAKER_00]: are going up, no change in no till,
and really no change in adoption of cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the takeaway from this is,
if you allow farmers to get money from
[SPEAKER_00]: this program, they're going to be included
in the outcome of the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not willing to change their
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not willing to change their
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're willing to sort of get their foot
in the door, but then they're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do what works for their schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the money is not really driving change
in the behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are we so concerned with early
planting and late killing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the program is concerned with late
killing, which is a problem from our
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but not from the perspective
of the policymakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of like your potential
growing degree days on the Y axis versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: given planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from the Y research station on
the Eastern Shore, which is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main cover crop hotspot in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got here the number of growing
degree days you might accumulate until the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop is dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say January 1st and then the
first date you're eligible to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's March 1st and then through sometime
in the spring, May 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that in the fall, there isn't
very much difference between the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we tend to have similar weather
every year in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a lot more growing degree days
if you plant early than if you plant late,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe two to four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we might have a warm winter where
by March 1st you accumulated a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree days, or we might have a
cold winter where, you know, you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: very little change from January to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't see a huge increase,
but you see them start to spread out from
[SPEAKER_00]: year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going into the spring,
you see an actual like huge increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that is what really drives
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass is what's going to drive nitrate
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is the whole point of the
program is to accumulate nitrate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall and keep it from being leached out
over winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why the program is not
really incentivizing later kill dates,
[SPEAKER_00]: because from their perspective,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they think that nitrogen is
already lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We happen to think that there are other
benefits to cover crops, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not really the point of the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we wanted to answer some
of these questions, we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of some field studies and some
remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified a bunch of sites over on
the eastern shore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is near that Y research station that
I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all very sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost all ultisols, like
textured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, these are the top
counties that are enrolled, the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: county, the number four county,
and the number three county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there are a bunch of other top
tens here on the eastern shore,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a few in the central Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by we, I actually mean Dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and took samples in the
winter, sort of like when the cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: was going into dormancy, and then in the
spring after green up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're starting to accumulate a little
bit more biomass, took samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze them for CNN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the real difference
between a cold year and a warm year back
[SPEAKER_00]: to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cold year, you accumulate very little
biomass from December to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a warm year, you can accumulate two to
four times as much biomass from December
[SPEAKER_00]: to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's something that we
think is really valuable, but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of farmers who don't want to
have that high residue out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as this program is
concerned, as long as you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: something here, that's a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, is that enough of a
success for all of the things that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve, like soil health, like
phosphorus loading, and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that could happen in the spring
that are not being targeted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: program?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program, you know, has some
diversity in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's radishes and there's legume mixes,
but 90% of the farms enrolled are cereal,
[SPEAKER_00]: rye, wheat, or barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is not super important,
but basically this is all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices that the farmers are
reporting and did some machine learning
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they cluster together is
the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they end up forming these clusters
where people who are planting after
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans tend to plant late, they have a
variety of establishment practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: they plant a variety of species,
but this is sort of one of the clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got people who are
planting wheat, you've got people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing broadcasting of various varieties,
people who are planting barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people who are planting rye mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are sort of some shorthands to
think about these different clusters that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's reasonable to assume that these
management practices would vary together
[SPEAKER_00]: because soybeans come out of the field
later in our region, so you can't get your
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop in until later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the question is, how do these
cover crops perform in these clusters that
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came out with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, you know,
after soybeans means late, wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: barley, and rye, means drilled,
these small grains, and then broadcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: often earlier, but, you know, either
aerial or just broadcast after the crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is the details of the
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that we've got these nice lines
that connect them, and some are much
[SPEAKER_00]: steeper than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's statistically
significant that rye outperforms all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other clusters, and then our two small
grains are next, and then we've got our
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast and our after soybeans pulling
up the rear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is rye is just
always going to be more performant than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to put on more biomass,
it's going to salvage more nitrogen no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter when you plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got, and, you know,
you would expect that your wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: barley would do well, but not as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting out of this is,
you know, even if you plant after
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans, even if you drill in,
even if you plant a good species like rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're never going to get that yield
performance because the slope of this line
[SPEAKER_00]: just isn't high enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how far out you go on these
growing degree days, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically telling us that if you
don't get an early establishment in fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get a good stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise with the broadcasting,
no matter how early you get it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not getting good soil contact,
you're not going to be getting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: stand, and it's never going to be able to
catch up to your, you know, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: well-managed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this is sort of the final
researchy data bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at, this is kilograms of N
that is in the biomass in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by the number of dollars that are
paid to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very consistent, no matter
whether it's in the commodity program or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's traditional cover crop,
doesn't matter if it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: between the different clusters here,
rye is a little bit better, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the median, this heavy black line is
pretty similar among all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of answers our last question
of, are these payouts commensurate with
the benefits they're getting?
It seems like, yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are poorly paid are poorly
performing, but it ends up being kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wash in terms of N per dollar,
which is one metric that you might use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next step of this is that we're
going to extend this analysis to use
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass estimates from satellite imagery,
and Dean's going to talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he's going to talk a lot about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to test these
relationships across soil and landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, you know, distance to the edge of
a watershed, elevation, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick conclusions, cover crops
behave like crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would expect you need both early
planting and good seed soil contact in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to get a good stand to drive
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these small grain subsidies that were
available in the program achieved a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same goals of cover crops at a lot
lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any other questions before I turn it
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: That extension sociological component
seems like is very variable among
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some district agents who are
going to be very hands on and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: others who, you know, are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that the state has that on
their radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I read through the meeting
or the meeting notes of sort of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: recent planning committees, you know,
they're not even thinking about trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on what Dean just told us,
sounds like probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they're sort of shifting it
from an incentive to a regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
