[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Floracast episode on
comparing organic substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last few years, I have noticed an
increased interest from growers in using
[SPEAKER_00]: organic substrates for growing flower and
vegetable transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This begs the question, what is an organic
substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, a substrate or potting mix that
is derived from naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: substances and does not contain synthetic
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the ingredients that we already
use in substrates are considered organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would include peat, sand,
vermiculite, perlite, compost that are
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared according to NOP guidelines,
and then organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certified organic production,
the ingredients in an organic substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: must meet National Organic Program or NOP
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all cases, an operation should check
with their organic certification agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is not organic about conventional
potting mixes?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this table, we list the recipes for the
conventional Cornell peat-lite mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It calls for half a cubic yard of peat
moss and half a cubic yard of coarse
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite with some various fertilizer
and wetting agent amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peat moss, vermiculite, and limestone
are appropriate for organic use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the synthetic fertilizers,
triple super phosphate, potassium nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the micronutrient charge cannot be
used, as well the conventional wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agent would not be acceptable for organic
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The objective of the trial that I'm going
to talk about that was conducted with my
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student Stephanie Beeks was to
trial several organic substrates for the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth effects on flower and vegetable
transplants without additional
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trial, we wanted to look at a range
of locally, regionally, and nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: available mixes and compare them to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have noticed that, in particular,
a lot of the organic vegetable transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: growers prefer mixes to be preloaded with
a lot of nutrients that make the plant
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry the plant for four to six weeks
of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, in the trial, we did not add
additional fertilizer as we wanted to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how well growth would do using just the
fertility from the mixes themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trial, we took plugs of tomato,
pepper, pansy, petunia, and Snapdragon
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings, and we transplanted these in
four-inch pots which had various organic
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pots were grown on for six weeks at
a fairly warm greenhouse temperature of 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit, and they were watered
daily or as needed with tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trial, we did not use any
additional fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The substrates that we used in the trial
included Cornell Organic Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that we have prepared using
peat, perlite, and vermicompost recipe
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see here where the
vermicompost is supposed to supply the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, we used dolomitic limestone to
add some calcium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to increase the pH of the mix,
as well as add green sand, rock phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and blood meal to add additional N,
P, and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other substrates that we used in the
trial include sunshine, natural,
[SPEAKER_00]: and organic substrates number one and
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are peat, perlite-based
substrates with an organic starter charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two mixes from the Vermont Compost
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is their FortLite, which contains
peat, their compost, perlite, and several
[SPEAKER_00]: different sources of organic nutrients,
as well as their FortV, which is similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to FortLite, but it does not contain
perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a locally available organic mix
prepared in upstate New York that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: peat, compost, and a poultry litter
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from the Hudson Valley, we trialed
McEnroe Organic Farm Premium Light Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mix contains compost, peat,
and perlite, as well as several sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, from Sunshine, we also trialed
their Organic PX2 mix, which besides peat
[SPEAKER_00]: and perlite, contains quite a bit of bark,
as well as composted peanut shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the pH and the electrical
conductivity of these mixes before
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For potting mixes, the suggested pH before
planting would be 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the mixes that we trialed, the Sunshine
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 and No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 mixes, as well as the locally formulated
mix, had pHs above the suggested range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cornell and the FortLite mixes were
slightly below the suggested range,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rest of the mixes were within that
suggested range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tested the pre-plant electrical
conductivity, or EC, which is a total
[SPEAKER_00]: measure of the salts, which would include
both fertilizer salts, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: non-fertilizer salts, such as sodium and
chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the mixes that we looked at,
Cornell, Sunshine No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 and Sunshine No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4, and the local mix, had relatively low
saturated media extract EC values.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PX2 was roughly in the normal range,
and the FortLite, the FortV, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: McEnroe, which were formulated with a
large dose of organic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: came in at the high end of the normal
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I will show a series of photos
demonstrating the results of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth trials after six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Pepper, we noticed that the largest
plants were found with the FortLite,
[SPEAKER_00]: the locally prepared mix, and McEnroe mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, the Cornell mix and the FortV mix
gave suitable plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sunshine mixes, Sunshine No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 and Sunshine No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4, and PX2, gave fairly small plant
growth, and this was expected due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: low starter nutrient charge that was added
to these mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato gave similar results, and one of
the things that you can note here,
[SPEAKER_00]: low fertility shows as both small plants,
such as the Sunshine 1 and 4 mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the take-home messages for
tomato, which is a heavier feeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: while we can grow a large plant with some
of these mixes that have a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer incorporated into the
substrate, they will eventually run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading to nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Pansy, we did not include the PX2 mix
in this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noted that the McEnroe, the FortV,
the FortLite, and the locally prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes gave the largest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell mixed the second largest,
and Sunshine 1 and No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 somewhat smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Snapdragon, we found that the locally
prepared mix was not at all suitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing Snapdragons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was potentially due to a high
ammonium charge in the compost that was
[SPEAKER_00]: used in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: For petunia plants, it was a similar story
with the largest plants coming from FortV,
[SPEAKER_00]: McEnroe, FortLite, as well the local mix
was suitable for petunia production,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium-sized plants from the Cornell mix,
and smaller plants from the Sunshine 1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's very evident from
this picture is that the new growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants exhibits iron deficiency from many
of the substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows up as yellowing between the
veins on these upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, one thing to take into account
when using any potting mix, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional or organic, is the starting
pH and starting limestone charge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your water's alkalinity,
you may need to use a mix that has a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous trial, we noticed that the
Sunshine mixes were prepared with only a
[SPEAKER_00]: starter nutrient charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they were not intended to supply
all of the nutrients for crop growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we wanted to test one of the
mixes, Sunshine No.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4, and trial two different organic
fertilizer sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we conducted a trial with Sustain
844.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustain is a poultry litter and hydrolyzed
feather meal-based certified organic
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other organic fertility source that we
tried was Wormpower vermicompost,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a lower nutrient charge than the
Sustain, so we used it at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporation rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used it at 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30% by
volume incorporated into the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: before transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Sustain trial, we noticed that for
pepper, about five pounds per cubic yard
[SPEAKER_00]: gave the best growth, and any additional
applied Sustain did not increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of growth by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tomato, which is a heavier feeder,
we noticed that about 10 pounds per cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: yard gave good growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vermicompost trial, for tomatoes,
which are a heavier feeder, we noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that at least 10% of the vermicompost by
volume, and really up to 20%, gave very
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, well-fertilized plants with less
symptoms of nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the trial, we came away with several
take-home lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to check with your supplier to
determine the amount of nutrient charge in
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the substrate intended to carry the
plant for four to six weeks from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility that's loaded up into it,
or is the fertility that's added intended
[SPEAKER_00]: to serve as only a starter charge to carry
the plant for the first week or two after
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other lessons that we learned are that we
recommend getting a laboratory media test
[SPEAKER_00]: done on your materials before you plant
into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another lesson is to monitor the
electrical conductivity, or the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done both pre-plant with the
laboratory media tests, or at-home tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can also be done throughout the growth
cycle as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixes preloaded with heavy nutrients will
have a high EC, and you will need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful with salt-sensitive seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you monitor EC throughout the
experiment, low and decreasing EC is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to suggest low nutrients, and the amount
of nutrients will be declining over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, if you monitor pH over time,
this will also be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that compost and other organic
fertilizer sources, such as poultry
[SPEAKER_00]: litter, can raise the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple final notes are that organic
producers should always consult their
[SPEAKER_00]: certification agents before purchasing and
using product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always conduct your own in-house trials
before using new materials at full
[SPEAKER_00]: production scale.
