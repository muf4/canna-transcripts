[SPEAKER_04]: When we think about climate change
mitigation, that is, the ways in which we
[SPEAKER_04]: can reduce our carbon footprint,
we might consider turning off the lights
[SPEAKER_04]: when we leave the house, riding our bike
to work, or driving a fuel-efficient car.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of us don't think about the food
we eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, when it comes to
agriculture, there's a misconception that
[SPEAKER_04]: reducing emissions means sacrificing a
farm's economic viability.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this needn't be the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to climate change
mitigation, agriculture provides many
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities for us to both reduce our
emissions while also enhancing the
[SPEAKER_04]: profitability and long-term sustainability
of our farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the best examples of this is an
investment in generating on-farm renewable
[SPEAKER_04]: energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be clear, we are not talking about
growing biofuels for ethanol, but rather
[SPEAKER_04]: direct on-farm energy production through
the use of manure, solar, and wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: These technologies can help farms become
net zero, which means that the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: gas emissions produced on the farm are
balanced by the farm's efforts to offset
[SPEAKER_04]: or sequester an equivalent amount of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both have different concerns and
feelings about climate change,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they share a commitment to farming for
renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: For thousands of years, farmers like Don
and Chip have looked for ways to maximize
[SPEAKER_04]: their resources and improve the efficiency
of their farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: In continuing this tradition, both have
been able to take advantage of their
[SPEAKER_04]: existing on-farm resources to produce
energy and promote the long-term economic
[SPEAKER_04]: viability of their operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Don, this has meant building an
anaerobic digester.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have currently about 1,500 milk cows,
1,200 supporting livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We farm about 2,000 acres in Stanley,
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We produce in the neighborhood of 40
million pounds of milk a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is marketed locally through the
Upstate Milk Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a farm that now has four
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the third.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter and my son will be taking the
business over as time moves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four years ago, we were
investigating building an anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: digester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically an anaerobic digester is a
containment vessel where the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: usually manure and sometimes an additional
feedstock like food waste or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material is basically aggregated
and it undergoes a decomposition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It normally stays in there for on average
20 to 25 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes are constantly breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that process, a material
called biogas is created, 60% methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore we can use that as an input
to an electricity generation unit and
[SPEAKER_00]: generate electricity sort of like they
would with natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farm is really usually able for a lot of
the year to offset their purchase power
[SPEAKER_00]: costs from using their own biogas-based
electricity on farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The initial reason we wanted to build a
digester was to create an ample supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the original reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't have enough bedding of the
solids to bed the cows and we wanted a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen-free bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reduction in the odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in an area where there's a fair
amount of housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fair amount of small little
hamlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we're out there
spreading millions of gallons of manure
[SPEAKER_01]: annually, we're very sensitive to how the
neighbors feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running this through an anaerobic digester
doesn't eliminate, eliminate totally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it certainly makes it more palatable
within the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ability to go out and put manure on
the fields without a lot of complaints and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of negative feedback from the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being community-friendly is very
important to this farming operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely societal benefits as
well when you get into talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change, reduced methane emissions
from livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the most important role that
digesters play in climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation is you're intentionally
capturing that methane that's produced
[SPEAKER_00]: from the livestock manure and putting that
towards a beneficial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of that methane, which is a
very potent greenhouse gas being released
[SPEAKER_00]: to the atmosphere, you're capturing that
and then once you use that in an engine
[SPEAKER_00]: generator set to produce electricity,
you can reduce purchased fossil fuel-based
[SPEAKER_00]: power from the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only has Don positioned Blonhurst
to now and into the future to take
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of generating a renewable
electricity resource, but also to the
[SPEAKER_03]: extent that there are revenue
opportunities presented because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ecosystem benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if in the future there's a substantial
revenue opportunity from demonstrating
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon sequestration and carbon
management, that's extremely valuable,
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly from a sustainability
perspective going forward and the most
[SPEAKER_03]: important sustainability issues,
financial sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic digestion technology works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely been proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really is lacking is an economically
favorable environment for these things to
[SPEAKER_00]: really take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of the feasibility studies that
we've done, we've come up with sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: tail-end marketing ideas, like a green
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different farms with digesters or climate
mitigation strategies could put their milk
[SPEAKER_00]: together and claim that it was carbon
neutral or green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a marketing strategy and
I think people would pay more,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like they pay more for organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most dairies our size and frankly probably
a little larger over the next 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: have got to adopt some sort of a
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a resource within the waste
stream in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got carbon that can be reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon footprint, what is somewhat of
a nuisance is now a resource if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: digester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we've found that the amount
of time needed to operate this digester
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a whole lot more, maybe another half
hour a day more than what we already had
[SPEAKER_01]: invested in handling our manure waste
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This originally was budgeted to cash flow
and now it's looking at one year of
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears that it's exceeded our
expectation and the digester is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies that can make us
neighbor-friendly, community-friendly and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment-friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: By proactively managing his farm's waste
stream through the use of a digester,
[SPEAKER_04]: Don is lowering his farm's methane
emissions while farming for energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Digesters are well-suited for dairy farms,
but they are not the only technology
[SPEAKER_04]: available to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: For farms without manure, solar and wind
production can play a pivotal role in
[SPEAKER_04]: reducing carbon emissions.
[SPEAKER_04]: 35 miles north of Stanley, New York,
near the shores of Lake Ontario,
[SPEAKER_04]: Chip Bailey, too, is farming for energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my 30th year farming since
graduating from Cornell in 1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have currently about 160 acres in apple
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow about 24 different apple varieties
and we pick on average about 165,000
[SPEAKER_02]: bushels on that 160 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, we're net zero as far as
our energy use.
[SPEAKER_02]: The renewable change, my wife Carla and I
both decided on together and my wife is a
[SPEAKER_02]: big part of our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meeting our net zero energy goals is
something that we decided together and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're both committed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I first began looking into renewable
energy in the fall of 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long and short of it, from 2001 it took me
until 2009 to get that windmill up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A month after I put up the windmill,
we installed our first solar system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could kind of add on to that as we
needed more power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all our cold storages, shop,
labor camps, life facilities here on the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm, including my house, is powered with
renewable energy and that reduces our
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: On an annual basis, we produce about
180,000 kilowatt hours of power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be enough roughly to power
18 homes on an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look worldwide, there's not enough
water and energy and food is right up
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in a plentiful land here,
but you look worldwide, there's definite
[SPEAKER_02]: shortages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those three things, I think there's
always going to be a demand for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we're a growing business,
we've created our own demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not produce it and utilize it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean really, when you look at what we're
doing growing apples, we're taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy from the sun and producing a crop
of apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what we're doing is the same
thing with the solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're harvesting the sunshine with apples
or renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything in life is a gamble and anything
new, you're going to take some lumps over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I end up calling it the
bleeding edge instead of the leading edge,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're going to get some cuts and
scrapes and bruises when you're trying out
[SPEAKER_02]: these new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there an economic benefit to going
net zero?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just you got to manage your own
timeline as far as the repayment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a cost that you are going to pay
to the power company every month for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to be a burden to your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that there is a way,
and we've proven that here, that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have it both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have an obligation as
farmers and for stewards of the land to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide for the next generation,
not just the next generation of farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through long-term planning and careful
management, Chip and his wife's orchard
[SPEAKER_04]: has become a local model for renewable
energy production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much so that the community of
Williamson, New York, where the orchard is
[SPEAKER_04]: located, has embraced alternative energy
at the municipal level and committed
[SPEAKER_04]: itself to going net zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not always be easy, but farmers
like Chip and Dawn have found ways to
[SPEAKER_04]: reimagine the traditional values of
farming by incorporating new technologies
[SPEAKER_04]: that promote their businesses,
benefit their communities, and address
[SPEAKER_04]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
