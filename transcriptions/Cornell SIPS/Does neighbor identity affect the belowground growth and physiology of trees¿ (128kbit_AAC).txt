[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you everyone for coming to the
last of the horticulture seminar series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take the next 50 minutes
to go over the research that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for the last four years as part of
my master's and PhD that has taken place
[SPEAKER_00]: both here at Cornell as well as abroad
over in Munich, Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as many of you know, I'm working
under the guidance of Dr. Taryn Bowerly
[SPEAKER_00]: and her lab group and Taryn is very much
interested in plant roots, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant roots of woody species,
and I'm no exception to that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: My interests are also in the growth and
the physiology of roots of woody species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I was saying, when I came to Cornell
back in 2009 and when I was speaking with
[SPEAKER_00]: Taryn about designing some projects,
I was very, very much interested in this
[SPEAKER_00]: question, the title of my talk today,
which was, does neighboring species
[SPEAKER_00]: identity have any effect on the below
ground growth and physiology of trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last four years, I've worked
to try to better understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my attempt to understand whether
below ground interactions and species
[SPEAKER_00]: identities were affecting the growth and
physiology of trees, I designed two main
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One main project was the below ground
interactions of root systems in three
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect of neighbor identity on the
three dimensional use of space between
[SPEAKER_00]: root systems, as well as a larger scale
experiment that took place in Munich,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, looking at the effects of inter
and intraspecific interactions and the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and physiology of 70-year-old
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing scales from looking at the
very, very fine spatial relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: among interacting root systems in three
dimensions and seedlings all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70-year-old trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing scales and crossing ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the interesting
observations that I made in my experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: that took place in Germany led me to run a
third experiment that looked into the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon supply chain of our 70-year-old
trees, spatial and temporal trends,
[SPEAKER_00]: and carbon allocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a quick raise of hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here is not necessarily that familiar
with the terms inter and intraspecific?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be using them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I assume that everyone here is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the sake of argument,
I'm going to go over it, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of argument, say that
you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will be using these terms so
often, it's really important that I hammer
[SPEAKER_00]: these home so that we're all very,
very clear about what exactly it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, inter, when I think of inter,
I think of him and her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different species interacting
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oak, poplar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an intraspecific interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poplar, poplar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an intraspecific interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little tough, because inter,
intras, sound very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's try to really focus in on that
inter, him and her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why am I looking into inter versus
intraspecific?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter versus intraspecific interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've seen over the last 40,
50, 60 years across a host of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-dominated landscapes from Germany to
Portugal, temperate regions to tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, that as you increase species
richness, so this is a figure bought from
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooper in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you increase species richness,
the number of species, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: as you increase your intraspecific
interactions, we find that across a host
[SPEAKER_00]: of diverse landscapes that there is this
general trend of increasing above-ground
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes below-ground productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This figure specifically is looking at
productivity as a measure of grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: above-ground biomass per meter square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this trend is not universal,
we do see this, as I have mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: across diverse landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to understand, why is this
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the mechanisms that may be
causing this increase in productivity with
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing species richness?
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing intraspecific interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because my fascinations are centered
on below-ground growth and figures,
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology, clearly I want to look at the
below-ground mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the below-ground mechanisms and
some of the theories that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed for how these interacting
species, so how intraspecific interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: can result in greater amounts of
productivity, are the vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning and the horizontal
partitioning of root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these figures were bought from
Schenck, one in a review, one in a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really they're demonstrating is
the vertical separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across your vertical profile,
your rooting depth, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of your main volume of roots,
whereby by separating them vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: across space, you reduce the amount of
direct interactions, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by reducing the overlap, your root
systems are then taking up more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: per resource spent on the construction of
that root, leading to decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decreased competition may have the effect
or has had the effect of increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the vertical partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some studies looking at trees
have seen that some root or some species
[SPEAKER_00]: will separate their root systems sort of
laterally or horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think of it as some species
tend to be more territorial than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to the vertical partitioning,
this reduction in the overlap of root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems leads to decreased competition,
leads to greater overall productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just two theories of how
intraspecific interactions can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: greater productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wanted to look at these interactions
in three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, roots grow in three dimensions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Above ground, they grow in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below ground, they grow in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the methods that we have to
date for looking at root growth or the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of below ground interactions on
root growth are awfully limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the viewing of roots along
two-dimensional surfaces, rhizotrons along
[SPEAKER_00]: these clear acrylic tubes, which I'll
introduce later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mini rhizotron technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ingrowth cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have destructive measurements,
such as soil coring or the excavation of
[SPEAKER_00]: entire root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often we only have a single point in
time where we can observe these root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an inherent limitation to
looking at roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to take some of these emerging
technologies and see if I could apply them
[SPEAKER_00]: to root research and then ask previously
unanswerable questions about how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some researchers began trying this out
in about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around the 1990s, I believe 1993 was
one of the earlier experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've used a host of different
technologies to look at root growth across
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensionally explicit spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've used MRI, neutron radiography,
if you're lucky enough to have a nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: reactor around, ground-penetrating radar,
and X-ray computed tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, having tried out a set of different
methods focused in on X-ray computed
[SPEAKER_00]: tomography as the technology that's going
to help enable me to answer some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I incorporated this slide because I
wanted to showcase sort of how far we've
[SPEAKER_00]: come from some of the earlier work looking
at roots in three dimensions to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the more recent work looking at roots in
three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a study by Herman from 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see, the resolution is,
well, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, it's not nearly as good as
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have issues with the amount of visible
volume that we can image, resolving roots
[SPEAKER_00]: from your three-dimensional matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compare that to what we've seen
today from Meyerhofer, which is a lab out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the University of Nottingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that how different these
root systems are and how much really we
[SPEAKER_00]: can resolve from this, how many
improvements we have made since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've made a lot of technological
improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these improvements have been
demonstrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move away from demonstration and
think about applying a treatment and then
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifying the effects of this treatment
on below-ground growth and the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I developed this hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the main guiding
hypothesis of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was based off of some of the work
done by Phelik and Novoplansky,
[SPEAKER_00]: which looked at very, very fine-scale
relationships among roots and how roots
[SPEAKER_00]: were responding plastically to the
presence of different neighboring
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hypothesis was that seedlings under
inter, so inter, him and her, under
[SPEAKER_00]: interspecific treatments will exhibit
fewer spatial interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will manifest as greater minimum
root-root distances as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical partitioning of root systems
compared to intra-specifically growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how did I achieve this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the experimental setup that I
ran in the greenhouse here at KPL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have is this top-down
hydroponic irrigation system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this specific orientation
or organization of individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, spruce is black spruce, Pisium
ariana, and aspen is quaking aspen,
[SPEAKER_00]: Populus tremuloides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why did I choose these two species?
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose these two species because of their
difference in phenology, their functional
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, one being evergreen, one being
deciduous, and the fact that they co-occur
[SPEAKER_00]: across northern latitudes of the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some ecological implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it was for those reasons,
the functional differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what we have then are these plants
that are grown under this hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system for a period of about
two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're watered once a day using
top-down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of this synthetic sand medium,
which if we want to talk about the methods
[SPEAKER_00]: and why we chose the synthetic sand,
I'd be happy to talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the first month, they watered once
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after about one month, we observed
very slight wilting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we increased our watering regimen to
twice a month under complete nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: replete conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we separated or we made sure that
above-ground competition was not a factor
[SPEAKER_00]: because between our interacting
individuals, we had a small sheet of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetate to stop competition for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organization of either spruce and
aspen as solitary individuals are the
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our species pairs are
intraspecific spruce, interspecific,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then intraspecific aspen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after those plants were grown up at KPL
for around two months' time, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: then allowed to transpire for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water remaining in the containers
transpired away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take our containers containing our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transport them directly to Weill Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's micro and nano CT facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we image them using their
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, this is kind of what it
looks like as a figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our x-ray source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ring of detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using our x-ray source, we beam it through
the entire container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the material density,
so our root systems, water, our synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: sand medium, our plastic container,
you have attenuation of that x-ray beam,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is captured by a ring of detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that information is integrated
into these two-dimensional cross-sectional
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do that for the entire depth
of the container, giving us a stack of
[SPEAKER_00]: two-dimensional cross-sectional images,
which can be re-piled or recompiled or
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of as a three-dimensional image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we have these two-dimensional
images, we go through each one and we
[SPEAKER_00]: annotate where our roots are, so the
presence or absence of our roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I've demonstrated it in two
different colors because if we have
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting plants, we choose an arbitrary
color code to differentiate between one
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have these annotations,
we can take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using software, for example,
MATLAB, we take the root annotation
[SPEAKER_00]: information and then we recompile it into
an XYZ coordinate system that gives us the
[SPEAKER_00]: point, every point of every voxel or pixel
inside of this root system across
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having this XYZ coordinate system,
we can then do spatial quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can apply our metrics to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually, this is an example
image of one of our root systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is Quaking Aspen, and this is a
control plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the root tips highlighted
in blue just to kind of help the anatomy
[SPEAKER_00]: or the architecture pop out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get into some of the 3D
metrics, we had to take some destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements so that we can proof our
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And real quick, I'm going to point out a
couple observations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are measurements of below ground
biomass and below ground surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first thing to notice is the size
disparity between Aspen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Control, Enter, from left to
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up front, initially, what we see is the
huge size disparity between Aspen and
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce, where Aspen is between 20 and 100
times the biomass and the surface area of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce is 20 to 100 times smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about it as Aspen being 20
to 100 times larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the interesting observation is that
interspecific Aspen, when grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of Spruce, so Aspen and Spruce
together, we see that when growing next to
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce, it had the effect of reducing
biomass and surface area by 50% or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this large Aspen plant that's 20 to 100
times the size when growing next to its
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor, Spruce, will have a reduced
biomass and surface area by 20 or by 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with these initial observations,
we see in Spruce difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: Control and Entra, but not between Entra
and Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, we also do not necessarily
see a significant difference between Entra
[SPEAKER_00]: and Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these observations are between
Controls and our different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Spruce, we see no significant
effect of treatment on below ground
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just initial observations
that we see in some of our destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I incorporated this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I wanted to showcase what these
different treatments look like in three
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, I had the orientation of
Control Spruce, so Solitary, Entra,
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter, and Entra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is what they look like in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see here in Enter, blue is our
Spruce, whereas this orange-reddish color
[SPEAKER_00]: represents our Aspen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looks like in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with these three-dimensional root
systems and our XYZ coordinate systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that demonstrate where every single point
of this root system is in
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space, we can run our
three-dimensional metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can really begin to quantify the
effects of treatment on the below ground
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of these roots, and as well as
their occupation and utilization of
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measured the radial density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the lateral spread of our root
system, so how wide or how tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major-minor radii, which describes the
directionality of our root systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they growing more linear towards
something, away from something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured minimum root-root distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the minimum distance between a
single root tip on a root system and its
[SPEAKER_00]: next closest neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these measurements were made for every
single root tip in that root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measured volume as a function of
depth and root tips as a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the sake of time today,
it looks like the numbering scheme's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the sake of time today,
we're gonna talk about these two specific
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before you get lost, there's a lot of
information on this screen, so let me go
[SPEAKER_00]: over it as quickly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two figures are broken initially
down by species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Aspen on our left and we have
Spruce on our right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is a scatter plot of data
looking at root-root distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proportion of roots tips that are a
specific distance from other root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proportion of roots at a specific
root-root distance for Aspen and for
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our scatter plot where we
model the probability distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: function using two covariate models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's this line here, this line of fit
is this probability distribution function,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we used and applied to both Aspen
and two Spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have in the top right corners
similar bits of information, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: it represented as the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our probability distribution function
of our root-root distances and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: mean distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two slightly different ways of
representing the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: information or the same kind of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we see is looking at the
probability distribution function of our
[SPEAKER_00]: root-root distances in Aspen that across
treatments, there's no real effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: root-root distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, like I said before,
we are looking at root tips as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming close to each other and the minimum
distance between a root tip and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: closest root tip across every root tip in
the entire root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that for Aspen treatment does not
have much of an effect on the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of root-root distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does have a slight effect on
the mean distance between root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that intra and inter-specific both
are significantly different from our
[SPEAKER_00]: control and that inter-specific root tips
are spaced about a millimeter and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: to two millimeters further than the root
tips under control treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for Spruce, we see that the
probability distribution function of our
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum root-root distances differs
between inter-specific, inter-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: differs from the controls and from the
intra-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this divergence here for
inter-specific and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-specific has a greater number of
larger distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the root tips are even more spread out
and that's represented also here when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at mean distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that inter differs from control
and intra an order of about six to 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four or five millimeters further spaced
out under inter-specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of, so when we're looking at this
information, we're saying to ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, under inter-specific treatments,
we see that simply based on the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of a neighbor, that root tips are spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the order of a one and a half
millimeters to six millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the implications have to do with
looking at the influence of rhizosphere or
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at nutrient depletion zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we imagine these root systems growing
together and perhaps there's a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of overlap than what we see here
under this specific experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know that these two species are capable
of responding very plastically to the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of a neighboring plant by
separating the root tips on the order of a
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter and a half to six to seven
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can have a huge effect on the overlap
between nutrient depletion zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the interaction between root
tips that may affect what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that the rhizosphere as
far as its distance from the root tip is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely small in the order of less than
a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that nutrient depletion zones,
depending on what the nutrient is,
[SPEAKER_00]: can range from half of a millimeter to two
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant's capacity to respond
plastically to the presence of a neighbor
[SPEAKER_00]: could have long lasting effects when
replicated or thought of from the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: root system perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the uptake of nutrients and the growth
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tips, these distance measurements
are made per individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect of that neighbor on the
individual's use of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something to be looked at in the
future, looking at the distance between
[SPEAKER_00]: that Aspen root tip and that very,
very fine specific distance to its
[SPEAKER_00]: neighboring root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I mentioned before, this is
second of our fifth metrics that I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm quickly going to do that because
there's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this metric was looking at root system
volume as a function of depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is root system volume being
distributed across vertical space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it occupying vertical space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's broken down between
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Aspen on our left, Spruce on
our right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have root system volume, as I
mentioned, as a function of depth,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this is the top of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we see for both species when
running a two-way NOVA, that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant effect of depth, as you would
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant effect of treatment
and a significant interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: depth and treatment on root system volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as many of us know who have ever
studied roots, they tend to be a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: volume towards shallow layers and less
volume towards deeper layers of a
[SPEAKER_00]: container or in a natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that depth was a significant
predictor, not altogether surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the significant interaction
between depth and treatment for both
[SPEAKER_00]: species, though it's slightly harder to
see in Spruce, is that simply based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of a neighbor or perhaps the
identity of that neighbor, we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: root systems are occupying distinctly
different vertical positions along our
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can't necessarily say that one is
going to be that much more shallow or this
[SPEAKER_00]: much more deep, but we can see that they
are simply separating the main volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: their root systems or chunks of their
volumes of root systems across vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that for both Aspen as well as
for Spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, as we remember
from the destructive figures, we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: Spruce here has a greater overall volume
under intraspecific, which is translated
[SPEAKER_00]: here as volume across depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more time to sort of bring it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that root tips based on their
neighboring identity can begin to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: space the distances between the root tips,
as well as begin to occupy different
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical positions along the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intraspecific interactions, especially in
Aspen, we see lower root system biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: root tips are more spread out,
and they can occupy different vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the implications?
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at pairing different
individuals together in plant dominated
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes, the capacity for these plants
to respond plastically by separating root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems from very, very fine scales,
such as root tip distances, to a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more broad scales, such as the
vertical rooting volume, could have really
[SPEAKER_00]: long effects and long lasting effects on
competition and the uptakes of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, using this really technologically
advanced approach to understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between root systems and three
dimensions requires so much spatial and
[SPEAKER_00]: temporal resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have, really what we have is among
the highest possible spatial resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can have, down to 50 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we lack the temporal resolution,
so the ability to take these images over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we have designed an experiment where
we could increase our temporal resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we do this kind of modeling,
it needs both high temporal and high
[SPEAKER_00]: spatial resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that some of our observations indicate
that there is the potential for there to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a reduction in direct competition
between these fine roots in Aspen and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to a lesser degree in Spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, as I mentioned earlier,
understanding what species can respond
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamically and plastically to the
presence of other species could have long
[SPEAKER_00]: lasting effects on very fine scale,
I guess, fine scale levels of competition
[SPEAKER_00]: between individual fine roots that is kind
of hard to conceptualize, but could have
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious consequences when multiplied
across the entire root system for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the log-on interactions in 3D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to change scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move from this controlled
environment using this irrigation system
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving from seedlings to these
70-year-old trees inside of an
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental station located outside of
Munich, Germany, where we're asking very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does inter- and intraspecific
interactions affect the root growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, we can't take these CT
instruments and dunk them in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're going to be asking a few
questions and we'll be using a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as many of you have seen before,
I have introduced Kronzberg Experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: Station more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in collaboration with the Technical
University of Munich in Freising,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, which is on the outskirts of
Munich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a really wonderful place to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the experiment began actually in 2010
when I set up all of the site
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mini risotron tubes, our root box,
our soil water-sensoring mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil temperature, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began taking our measurements
after a year of normalization in 2011 and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to take these through 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why am I going all the way to
Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this very unique two-species
arrangement that we have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is is a deciduous,
beach-dominated region, so Fagus Savatica,
[SPEAKER_00]: an evergreen-dominated region,
so that's Pessia Abis, and then directly
[SPEAKER_00]: between these two monotypic regions in
each plot, you have this region of assumed
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intra-intra-intra-specific interactions
replicated, again, in a much larger site
[SPEAKER_00]: with 70-year-old trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I included this slide because I want
to focus everyone's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a three-dimensional root
system, you say to yourself, I see that
[SPEAKER_00]: root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the fine roots,
the root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the 70-year-old four,
the 70-year-old trees, our interests are
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the fine roots,
the root tips and the roots that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit upstream from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this figure I borrowed from Brian
Emmett's master's thesis from 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it just demonstrates is
differences in root anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what I wanted to do is just
focus in on the fine roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a root box showing the growth
of fine roots along this 2D surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using these root boxes, we can sample
roots of known ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age from known species, whether they're
colonized, uncolonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, this is where we need to
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to focus in on the fine roots,
those roots that are uniquely poised to
[SPEAKER_00]: take up nutrients, to take up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most metabolically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respire the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're associating with soil
microorganisms, fine roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, the objectives at
Konzberg Experimental Station were to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine, excuse me, a little bit of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to determine the effects of inter-
and inter-specific interactions on root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, I chose to focus in on
root survivorship, so how long they live
[SPEAKER_00]: after they are born, the spatial and
temporal deployment, so vertical,
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal deployment, their specific
morphology, so shifts in diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: specific root lengths, specific root
areas, and then physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have always been very much
interested in carbon, so I wanted to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: in on the potential effects of inter- and
inter-specific interactions on fine root
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these sets of predictions came from
this one initial hypothesis that beech and
[SPEAKER_00]: spruce occupy distinctly vertical rooting
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact is, over the past 20,
30 years, there have been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research in these beech, spruce-dominated
forests across Germany and Norway and
[SPEAKER_00]: Poland, and a lot of these regions,
they have seen time and time again that
[SPEAKER_00]: spruce is pretty shallowly rooted and that
beech is very deeply rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this in mind, we would predict to
see this at our experimental site,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is beech and spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we think about it, if they are
occupying distinctly different vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: zones, it is likely that the competition
will be reduced, if only a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps a lot, and that a reduction in
competition will have the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing respiration, increasing fine root
diameter, reduced proliferation or
[SPEAKER_00]: production, and an increase in root
survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about answering these
questions and addressing these objectives?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have at the experimental site these
plots, so 10 plots, so this setup is
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated 10 times, and within each plot
we have MRs, representing mini-risotron
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes, two per spruce-dominated region,
two per beech-dominated region,
[SPEAKER_00]: and two in this mixed zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have TDR, time-domain reflectometry,
soil-water sensing stations to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: water from, volumetric water content from
zero down to 50 centimeters, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in each area a root box to allow us
to sample roots of known age, size,
[SPEAKER_00]: species, so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I incorporated this here for a very
important reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start reporting on any of the,
any of our physiological results,
[SPEAKER_00]: so looking at respiration and later on
talking a little bit about stable carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotopes, we focused in on the roots that
were greater than five and less than 20
[SPEAKER_00]: days, 21 days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these roots are the ones that are
highest, are the most metabolically
[SPEAKER_00]: active, they're respiring the most,
they are of a specific order, meaning they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very specific function,
and they're of a very specific age,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's in these roots that we see a
greatest amount of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the working end of the plant
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I incorporated that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some initial results, looking at
seasonal production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three years of observations,
but for the sake of time, I'm combining
[SPEAKER_00]: those into a single, into a single graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is three years summed up together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each of these comparisons,
because I didn't want to have too many
[SPEAKER_00]: letters and confuse you more than I may
already am, these comparisons are made
[SPEAKER_00]: within season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these letters are representing seasonal
comparisons, so within spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: within summer, within fall, within winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasonal production is just the measure of
the number of roots that are produced per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter square, across our four main
seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is that there are no real
differences between the number of roots
[SPEAKER_00]: produced under intra and inter-specific
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's not clear what the legend is,
similar to the way that our trees are
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented per plot, from beach-dominated to
mixed to spruce-dominated, that's how I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting my data, so hopefully it'll be
a little clearer for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we see no real difference between the
number of roots produced under intra and
[SPEAKER_00]: intra-specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see it in spring, summer,
fall, or winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that the peak production occurs
sometime around mid to early summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tailors off to the fall,
and then lowest amounts in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when running some statistics,
we see that actual spring production of
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and winter production of roots are
comparable, whereas summer production and
[SPEAKER_00]: fall production is comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, root production, see no
inter-intra-specific difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what we do see is this very
distinct difference between inter and
[SPEAKER_00]: intra-specific conditions, and the effect
it has on the depth that these roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while the number of roots being
produced may not differ, the depth at
[SPEAKER_00]: which they are produced does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the biggest distinction is
observable in inter versus intra spruce,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see that for both spring,
summer, fall, and especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also see some significant
differences in the depth of root
[SPEAKER_00]: production in beech roots, but it's on the
order of just a few centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas for beech, it's on the order of 10
to 15 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's take a step back real quickly
and think about real quick the
[SPEAKER_00]: observations that we made in our 3D
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw then the distancing between roots
and the vertical partitioning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different root systems, crossing scales to
a 70-year-old's trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that they are, in one way,
are doing the exact same thing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: order of a few centimeters to 10 to 15
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, inter-intra-specific interactions
having a very significant effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: depth of where your roots are being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, standing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standing crop is also a measure of the
number of roots per meter square similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to root production, but it's censored for
the roots that die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're not getting redundant
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at the number of live
roots at any given time starting in 2011,
[SPEAKER_00]: early summer or May, so spring,
summer, through 2012 and then 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this sharp increase is here because
our observations began in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our observations began in 2005,
in 2005 is where you would see this sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the standing crop of our
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't let that confuse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting observations here is this
strong divergence that we see in 2012
[SPEAKER_00]: where intra-specifically growing beech
roots drop in the number of their standing
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, and we see that there's a
complementary increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as it drops in one region,
it increases in the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you think of it as a form of
exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure, but we see this very,
very, very strong divergence between
[SPEAKER_00]: intra- and intra-beech, and that is
significant, and then it sort of tailors
[SPEAKER_00]: off the sort of comparable standing crop
in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see for spruce consistently
from the beginning of observation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: very end is that the standing crop of
intra- versus inter-differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, intra-specific roots,
so spruce roots growing underneath spruce
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, tend to have a greater standing
crop than spruce roots growing under this
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see, as far as standing crop is
concerned, significant differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survivorship is measured using the
Cox-proportional hazard model where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a set of observations of when roots
were born and a set of observations for
[SPEAKER_00]: when those roots specifically have died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one represents 100% of all living
roots, and because we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: survivorship, clearly they are all born at
one time, therefore they were living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then periodically over time,
this is when our observations began in May
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, we see that those roots will
periodically die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a measure of surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 100% down to some point where,
at some point, they will all be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this here just gives you a measure of
median survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the point at which, after they are
born, how many days to where 50% of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, upfront observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that for intra-beach and
intra-spruce, these are these lines right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, that there, surprisingly,
is no difference in survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know about evergreen species of
trees is that they tend to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative, so to speak, that they tend
to live a little bit longer, that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a greater investment in the construction
of their tissues, therefore their
[SPEAKER_00]: survivorship should be greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that it's comparable to our
deciduous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very interestingly, for both of these
species, we see that when they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in mixture, the roots live on the order of
100 to 200 days longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, roots that are growing under this
mixed region are growing and lasting 150
[SPEAKER_00]: to 200 days longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are long-lasting implications
for the amount of carbon that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: stored, the amount of tissues that can be
produced, and how long they are lasting,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply based on these interactions between
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these mixed regions having significant
effects on survivorship of our fine roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, getting into the physiology real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured the respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we measured it in nanomoles of O2
per gram per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one-to-one, so we can also think of
it as the nanomoles of CO2 produced versus
[SPEAKER_00]: nanomoles of O2 consumed per grams per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just how we chose to measure
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, broken down by species,
intra-inter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we see is that across the 2012
growing season and 2013 growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the 2012 growing season for
spruce, in the springtime, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic drop in the amount of respired
carbon that we could sample from our fine
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these observations only happen in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see that in the spring in 2012 and
2013, in the spring in 2012, that simply
[SPEAKER_00]: based on where these roots were growing in
proximity to another species, it had the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of reducing the amount of
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw these observations in spring,
and we only saw them in spruce for one
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find it fascinating that simply
based on the interaction with another
[SPEAKER_00]: species, whether it's site conditions,
whether the other conditions are causing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we see a reduction in fine root
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beach was equal to spruce, so our
deciduous species was equal to that of our
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen, which was very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that under interspecific conditions,
we have longer-lived tissues that at times
[SPEAKER_00]: can respire lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are produced more shallow,
and that in these mixed regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have greater standing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for thinking about the implications
for managing plant-dominated landscapes in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to store a slightly larger amount of
carbon or a very large amount of carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that by orienting the
organization of species, so what species
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations are there, it's possible that
we can, in fact, store a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, or we should at least think about
these unique species combinations that may
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to shifts in the use of carbon over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely, as I continue to crunch
through that data, because that's the last
[SPEAKER_00]: of my projects that I need to work on,
is that it's likely to be correlated with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our environmental conditions and
or soil water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that in this mixed region,
we see that there's some divergence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: volumetric water content, at times a
little drier, at times it's a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be having the effect on
respiration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we cross scales from seedlings,
look at very fine-scale spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions to larger-scale interactions
between inter- and intraspecific trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that are 70 years old, and now I'm gonna
talk to you about the below-ground carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain of these two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, based on some of the interesting
observations that interspecific
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions can reduce respiration by
quite a lot, that piqued my interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that led us to ask more questions
about, if they're respiring a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: less, where is that carbon coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking into the carbon supply chain,
and specifically, I wanted to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon supply chain across seasons and
across different tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I had mentioned, when constructing
and maintaining plant roots, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main questions was, where is the carbon
coming from and where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as labile carbon comes down,
and it's transported through the phloem,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that it's going to be allocated to
a certain number of pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be respired back to the soil
atmosphere continuum, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated into biomass, constructed as
cellulose or lignin, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: put into a storage compound, such as
starch, or it's going to be shuttled back
[SPEAKER_00]: up to somewhere else where there is a
large demand for carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we look at where the carbon is
coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the carbon coming from and where
it's going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one way to do that is using stable
carbon isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I included this slide for people who
are a little bit less familiar with stable
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon isotopes, and what we know about
stable carbon isotopes is that the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance of our 13C, so that is a atom of
carbon with one extra neutron,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it exists in our world at about
1%, so it's about 1% as abundant as our 12
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, which is much more abundant
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plants, based on the discrimination
against our 13 carbon isotope,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let me back up for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can say about carbon isotopes is
that plants have a certain affinity for
[SPEAKER_00]: your heavier versus your lighter carbon
isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain amount of carbon in the
air that is your heavier carbon isotope,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as it transitions or moves into
your intracellular leaf space and then en
[SPEAKER_00]: route through rubisco and then fixed into
carbon, that there's some physical
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination against your heavier carbon
isotope, and there are some biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: and enzymatic discrimination, because it
doesn't react as well inside of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: as your lighter carbon isotope does,
therefore the plants tend to discriminate
[SPEAKER_00]: against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what happens is that can have the
effect of certain molecules, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose or starch or labial carbon,
will have different proportions of your
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier versus your lighter carbon
isotope, and then what we can do is we can
[SPEAKER_00]: track this from the canopy, through the
trunk, down into the coarse roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the very fine roots, and get a better
understanding of the spatial and temporal
[SPEAKER_00]: allocation of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I have incorporated here is a
figure borrowed from a review by Bowling
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2008, and this shows the effect of
enzymatic discrimination, so biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination, on your heavier carbon
isotope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know this is some heavy stuff,
but let me try to be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're measuring our heavier,
the ratio of our heavier to lighter carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope, we're always doing that,
or most often we're doing that in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, R here is the ratio of your heavier to
your lighter carbon isotope against a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, which comes from, it's called
Viennapedi dolomite, and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative value, which is our delta value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I report values in the coming
slides, you'll see that some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: negative, and that is the notation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this figure was borrowed to highlight
the effect of biochemical or enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination on your different carbon
compounds, sugars, starch, proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose, and these measurements are
difference calculations, simply looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: your carbon-rich compound in relation to
your leaf organic matter, so simple
[SPEAKER_00]: subtraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that, you know,
starches tend to be more enriched,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they tend to be higher, whereas lignin
and lipids tend to be more depleted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that while these will fluctuate across
species within species, they're often very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can track the movement of these
compounds by looking at their stable
[SPEAKER_00]: isotopic composition, and then we can know
more about where they're going,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, the amount of our
stable, or the amount of our heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon isotope in the atmosphere is a lot
more than the amount of our heavier carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope that we find within our plants,
and that's because there's discrimination
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens at the level of the leaf,
and then there's discrimination that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens enzymatically as, well,
in trees when rubisco is fixing CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that has the effect of having these
depleted values from leaf all the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depleted, as I mentioned before,
means low amounts of your heavier carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope, so it's depleted, and as you
approach zero, you have heavier amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: your, or larger amounts of your heavier
carbon isotope, so depleted, low amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched, high amounts, and depleted is
more negative, enriched is closer to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is what we know about trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we know a lot about the
fluxes of CO2, so the stable isotopic
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of CO2 coming from above
ground, below ground tissues, and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot about the organic matter,
so how much of your heavier carbon isotope
[SPEAKER_00]: is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we don't know a lot about is the
stable isotopic composition of our fine
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, and what people have not done a lot
of is seeing if we can use that
[SPEAKER_00]: information to track the movement of
carbon through a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the objectives, determine spatial
temporal patterns of carbon allocation in
[SPEAKER_00]: one evergreen and one deciduous species of
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was in Germany, so we have our
beech and our spruce again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to know if different size
class roots demanded different forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbons at different times, and were there
phenological differences, were there
[SPEAKER_00]: species differences, evergreen versus
deciduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I had three main hypotheses,
that deciduous species will respire carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring, that's closely related to
starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is intuitive because most of the
trees have not leafed out, and if they
[SPEAKER_00]: have, they're spending a lot of that
energy on leaf expansion and leaf growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and much less of that energy on below
ground growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's intuitive that as roots grow in
the spring, it's likely to come from some
[SPEAKER_00]: stored carbon compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: In evergreen species, we predict that
respired carbon will resemble a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthates and starch, because they do
not have that sort of seasonal constraint,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it'll be some mixture of two carbon
sources, and that the allocation between
[SPEAKER_00]: your higher order roots and your lower
order roots will differ for both species
[SPEAKER_00]: because of functional differences in root
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I said root order a couple of times,
let me describe to you exactly what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about when I say root order.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and second order roots are the most
distal part of our root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are our root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the roots, as I have said more
than once, that are uniquely responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for the uptake, or most of the uptake of
your resources, your nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: your waters, for associating with your
soil microbiota, and then you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: third and fourth order roots that are
often thought of as serving a very
[SPEAKER_00]: essential transport and storage function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, based on the differences in root
orders, they represent differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: function that's likely to have a
difference on the amount of carbon being
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated to them, or perhaps what form of
carbon is being allocated to them at a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another figure, a lot of stuff going on
here, let me describe to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, as before, broken down by
species, so beach by spruce, broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: by season, so spring measurements,
and fall measurements across 2012 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, and then we have orders,
so different orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the sake of time, I'm gonna
quickly glance through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see as was predicted was that
there is sort of a root order independent
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 13C signature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see that there are no differences
between root order and the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: as was predicted, likely because they are
using a single form of carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: a stored carbon compound, in order to grow
and to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see that for beach in the
fall, similar patterns between 2012 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, a divergence between root orders,
indicating likely that they are receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: different proportions of different carbon
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, perhaps more photosimilates to the
lower order or higher order, and more
[SPEAKER_00]: starch, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see that in spruce that there
is no seasonality, as was predicted,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was distinct differences in the
Delta 13C of your respired carbon coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off of your fine roots between your higher
order, so these are your root tips,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your upstream roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see that there's a significant
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see significant differences,
once again, the same scheme, spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall, 2012, 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: For both species, we're looking at laval
sugars, mainly sucrose glucose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at starch, so our carbon rich
compounds, the predicted compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are likely to be fueling respiration and
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are our carbon sources,
and you can think of biomass or CO2 being
[SPEAKER_00]: your carbon products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see significant differences,
root order differences, in beach,
[SPEAKER_00]: in both spring and fall of 2013,
and in spruce, in the fall of 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we don't see any significant
differences here, though we see similar
[SPEAKER_00]: trends, that was a result of low amounts
of replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we see for starch is there are
annual differences in the stable isotopic
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of starch and beach,
likely to do with the amount of turnover
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens in starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starch is relatively young,
and it turns over relatively rapidly,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas in spruce, we do not see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is that the spruce,
that starch in spruce either has a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: residence time, or that there is a rapid
amount of mixing of new carbon and old
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, so we can't really differentiate
between years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with all of that information,
and I know that was a lot of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: we looked at respired carbon, we looked at
starch, we looked at labile sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason why we measured all of that
is to develop a very basic mixing model to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what proportions of labile
sugars are photosynthates, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of starch are contributing to
fine root respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is this mixing model right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when broken down, all this really is
saying is respiration equals some
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of photosynthates plus some
proportion of starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have delta R, which is,
for the sake of this talk, not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, using that model, what did we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw, as was predicted, that in the
spring, starch is used almost exclusively
[SPEAKER_00]: in fine root respiration, independent of
root order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in the fall, that greater
proportions of labile sugars are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: your root tips, and greater proportions of
starch are going to your high roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the spruce, you see no
seasonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that first and second order roots
respire higher amounts of starch,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that is opposite trend observed in
beech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That your root tips are receiving higher
amounts of starch for respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that your third and fourth order roots
are respiring greater amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this look like if we're
looking at a map?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like I said before, we're mapping the
carbon supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it indicates is likely that beech,
at a given time, it has this sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: direct transfer of carbon from one tissue
to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, beech, at any given time,
will transport photosynthates from the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy to coarse roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, what it can also do is transport
directly from the canopy to its very fine
[SPEAKER_00]: root tips, as we observed in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas spruce tends to operate more
conservatively, so to speak, where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a carbon relay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from canopy to coarse roots,
and coarse roots must go through coarse
[SPEAKER_00]: roots en route to your fine root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this difference physiologically
in how these two different species are
[SPEAKER_00]: shuttling carbon from one place to the
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, we see strong
seasonality in beech and not much
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality, or no seasonality in spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the implications?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that overall, the inner specific
interactions can positively affect root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbon can be retained, respiration
can be reduced, competition can be
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the implications are for the
management of tree-dominated landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about, so you saw those
pictures at the Kronzberg Experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: That experimental station was a planted
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 years ago, after reparations,
they cut down their entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tree was cut down and sold off to
pay for reparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had an opportunity to
redevelop that landscape from scratch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have since created a much more
productive landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply based on the fact that they decided
to mix different species together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are possibilities to manipulate
our plant-dominated landscapes and our
[SPEAKER_00]: tree-dominated landscapes to increase
productivity over long time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that my research is in support of
greater biodiversity in plant-dominated
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes, which in some situations we
all recognize is possible and much more
[SPEAKER_00]: possible than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: My future directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to identify unique perennial
species combinations that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: productive in mixture, and I want to
understand the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than just knowing that they grow
better, it's important to understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: To map the carbon supply chain,
as I did before, looking at the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: proportions of different forms of carbons
being used for root growth and root
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration, under ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why I was really interested
in mapping the carbon supply chain and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at, in spruce, this carbon relay
versus in beech, this direct carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: transport, is because there are
implications for when that plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to a stress, especially drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if it's happening early
season versus late season, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt the supply of carbon coming from
your canopy to your below ground systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can have widespread consequences
on the growth of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to understand or be able to
predict the effects of drought or other
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of stresses on root growth,
it's important to know at what times
[SPEAKER_00]: during the year and through what tissues
your photosynthes versus your starch is
[SPEAKER_00]: being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to say thank
you to really so many different people for
[SPEAKER_00]: helping me through these four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I've been a little all over the
board, I've really tried to bring together
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different forms of research from
physiology to emerging technologies to
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand below ground growth from
many different, I guess, in many different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that being said, I'd like to
thank these people and the IAI Naughty
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for their small grant funds,
for Taryn for her guidance, and for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who have helped me both here at
Cornell and Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd like to say nice job.
Thank you.
I presume that these are mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were doing your seedling studies,
had you added spores of the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus, or were these now
mycorrhizal-free?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were mycorrhizal-free,
how much does that reflect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it popular, ectomycorrhizal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they share the same feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's another good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they ask it, is it ectomycorrhizal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't possibly share the same
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were designing that experiment,
that was a really important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, or as many of the Germans
have said for 100 years, the fungus grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on trees, not the other way
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are critical to the growth of
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this experiment, we took the kind
of controlled approach that you had to to
[SPEAKER_00]: address these sorts of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to exclude certain things like
biological interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by biological interactions,
I mean specifically interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: your roots and mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were they sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not sterile, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile, but they're not sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sterile, but they're not sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there things going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we didn't have inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that would transfer into a natural
environment, that's also a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're focusing in on the dynamic
shifts of these roots in a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space, that is one
important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to blow it up into a
natural environment, because we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: size disparity between spruce and quaking
aspen, quaking aspen is so much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very likely that if they were
within a certain proximity to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: quaking aspen would have outshaded spruce
after the first month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the story would have stopped
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your colleagues in Germany considered
mycorrhizal associations, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't avoid them if they'd be there on
the forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the components of my Indian
Ristron works, looking at our standing
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and turnover and survivorship,
et cetera, is quantifying and trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: correlative studies between growth and
survivorship and root abundance across
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical space, and also looking at
mycorrhizal abundance across vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in our many Ristron images,
the resolution is sufficiently high,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can say presence, we can quantify
the approximate number of hypo strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it stops there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very basic form of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sort of complementary study of mine,
which took place while I was doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: research, and is beginning now,
and they have one team, two post-docs,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically looking into all of the very
intricate mycorrhizal dynamics in that
[SPEAKER_00]: forest, that I would have to thank them
and ask if I could borrow that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future to work with that, knowing that
that is an unbelievably important
[SPEAKER_00]: component of our group growth and the
overall
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
How did you manage to do the restoration?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, restoration was measured using a
oxygenated buffer in a micro-wrap,
[SPEAKER_00]: or an oxygenated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thankfully... Were they still attached
to the tree, or did you cut them off?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in Germany, they have this wonderful
little experimental hut that is heated,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great for late measurements in
the fall, and it has running power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was this hut is located no
more than 50 meters away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would do is, having tracked the
roots' age, and from that known species
[SPEAKER_00]: using the acetate windows, we would then
identify the ones that sit between the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of greater than five, less than 21
days old, and we would have to excise
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would gently cut away from the
plastic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there are some factors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The factor is, you're moving it from the
soil into a buffered solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor one, you're excising them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor two, lots of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that that is one of the main
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we have to
accept, but there's also... It's a method
[SPEAKER_00]: that's tried and true, though,
how true it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different, but in our lab,
we've used it pretty consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the results are consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results are consistent, however,
with the effect of doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the root on respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something also that needs to be used,
and should not be overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
