[SPEAKER_00]: Okay well hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sticking around for on this
call today about youth and climate and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share an experience about developing
curriculum with and for Indigenous peoples
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lot of lessons learned with
this project and if you have any interest
[SPEAKER_00]: of working with Indigenous people
hopefully you'll be able to learn a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things from our own experience and apply
them as well or not apply them if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were something that didn't work on our end
and we'll share both the positives and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons learned that we wouldn't do again
in this whole journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go in a few minutes we'll just
do a whirlwind tour of that experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure to cover all aspects in the
brief time we have together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I start sharing some background
about this project I'll just put a
[SPEAKER_00]: question in the chat for all of you to
think about and respond to both attendees
[SPEAKER_00]: and panelists as I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could just review that and when
you have a moment of inspiration want to
[SPEAKER_00]: share that with everyone that would be
fantastic in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so this brief story is about my
experience in the Colorado Plateau area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Moab and just north of the Navajo
Nation and surrounded by a range of tribes
[SPEAKER_00]: including the Ute tribe, the Hopi tribe as
well and there's Apache and a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: other tribes that live still in this area
and have a very strong presence here and
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of a NECI initiative actually
Patricia Townsend in Washington formed a
[SPEAKER_00]: team and we submitted a National Science
Foundation grant to do this project called
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate Change Community Programs and
Opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the acronym of that what I
just said it's C3PO so we had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: nerdy Star Wars acronym for our project
and Patricia in her project worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: Latinx population in Washington and I
worked with Alaska or I worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous populations in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague Art worked with Indigenous
youth in Alaska and in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_00]: Melissa Cray worked with women forest
owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again my audience was not youth but
college age students and so I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: share that right from the onset that still
youth but not same as 4-H youth for
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so at the beginning of this NSF grant
our whole plan was to apply already
[SPEAKER_00]: created an excellent curriculum from the
University of California called Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewards and what I learned over time is
that a canned curriculum applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous populations even if it is
adaptive was not going to work very well
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wasn't going to be the best
approach that we had to design this from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground up and so that was one lesson
learned along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We formed an advisory council of
professionals and tribal members that had
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive experience working with
Indigenous communities and who were living
[SPEAKER_00]: in Indigenous communities to guide our
process as we rolled out our game plan for
[SPEAKER_00]: developing a curriculum focused around
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involved over time first of all we
needed to expand our timeline we learned
[SPEAKER_00]: right away with beyond the boundaries of
the NSF grant because building the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with tribal members took a
lot longer than even we had imagined at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning and so definitely extending
timelines is an important aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with Indigenous communities and
that's difficult in our academic
[SPEAKER_00]: environments with the turn and burn of and
giving us many reality checks like first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all our timeline was unrealistic and
from those talking circles we also are
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry from the advisory council we also
received guidance on hiring someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: with experience working with tribal
members to help us decolonize our survey
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument that we were planning to use
and we ended up moving completely away
[SPEAKER_00]: from surveying tribal members in the end
and just doing a depth qualitative process
[SPEAKER_00]: through what we call talking circles so
similar to focus groups we sat in circles
[SPEAKER_00]: and had conversations around climate and
those conversations fed into our
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum development process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did three talking circles in the end
one at the Red Canyon Powwow in Moab one
[SPEAKER_00]: in a Hogan down in Blanding and another
talking circle with organizational
[SPEAKER_00]: partners on Zoom and then also the Hogan
talking circle was with participants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: program called Native American Tribes
Upholding Restoration and Education and we
[SPEAKER_00]: did a first talking circle at the
beginning of our whole process down on
[SPEAKER_00]: their site where the program takes place
in Bears Ears National Monument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four total but with three different
audiences if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so those talking circles again that
took quite a while to build the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships and I won't go into depth
here because I have just a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes but I will say that we reached out
to chapter houses on the Navajo Nation to
[SPEAKER_00]: notify them of our work and to the Navajo
Nation IRB and we didn't receive a
[SPEAKER_00]: response from the Navajo Nation IRB which
we were told from some tribal members and
[SPEAKER_00]: on our advisory council that that couldn't
actually be good news that there weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: any red flags about the research but our
IRB was not happy with the fact we hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: received notification for the Navajo
Nation IRB and it really delayed our
[SPEAKER_00]: process project and so early communication
if the tribe you're working with has an
[SPEAKER_00]: IRB is extremely important and building
that in hindsight I would have built that
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the beginning of the grant
application process and one thing that was
[SPEAKER_00]: a positive in the end unexpectedly is I
had already volunteered at the Red Sands
[SPEAKER_00]: Powwow in years past and so I had
relationship with some of the staff there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that allowed us to conduct a talking
circle at the Powwow but we also paid to
[SPEAKER_00]: table there so we contributed to the event
financially and then we conducted a
[SPEAKER_00]: talking circle on the side of tabling an
educational table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first we launched a position to
decolonize our instrument and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: as Latinx and Indigenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first I was going to look at both
populations and climate perceptions from
[SPEAKER_00]: both and I learned that very few people
have depth experience with both cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of differences and so in
hindsight I would have just advertised for
[SPEAKER_00]: an Indigenous community coordinator
instead of a Latinx and Indigenous and
[SPEAKER_00]: then hired someone else to do the Latinx
side but again lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fast forwarding through time we
conduct our talking circles we transcribed
[SPEAKER_00]: code the results and we shared those back
immediately within two weeks with the
[SPEAKER_00]: participants to do a reference check of
the data make sure our interpretation was
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and then we created a handout
that was really easy to read and visually
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive that we administered at the Red
Sands Powwow and to our participants
[SPEAKER_00]: electronically to share about our
takeaways from the talking circles major
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the talking circles we hired three
Indigenous participants who had engaged in
[SPEAKER_00]: the talking circles to co-create a climate
change curriculum with us for the Native
[SPEAKER_00]: American tribes program.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the grant I had
planned to launch my own program and then
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that that would be in competition
with an already existing program within
[SPEAKER_00]: Bears Ears National Monument so we
partnered with them instead and just
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthened their program through our
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three Indigenous participants we hired
we paid a thousand each to work with us
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of several weeks to
co-create our climate change curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had weekly meetings and homework every
week and then we would come back and share
[SPEAKER_00]: our findings and our recommendations for
the program and that resulted in a climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change module that was developed for the
nature program that's a menu approach
[SPEAKER_00]: where people can sample and take what they
wanted to use in the program as speaker
[SPEAKER_00]: availability and other considerations were
taken into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example not every year potentially
they could do a rafting trip as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lesson plan but that the menu includes
that as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I'll just stop with that since we
only have three minutes left but I do want
[SPEAKER_00]: to share a couple resources if you are
interested in the work that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can share it looks like I didn't see
anyone weigh in on the question in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat but I will share two resources with
you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the handout that we gave to our
participants to share back the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other is that I'll share if I can
share let me see if I can share this
[SPEAKER_00]: handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shoot I can't share it but let me just
share my screen real quick and I will just
[SPEAKER_00]: show you what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so this is the handout that we gave
to the community members and just
[SPEAKER_00]: background study what was our objective
being very transparent with what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: and very simplified results take away from
the talking circles some key quotes
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting climate change with capitalism
et cetera and then the climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum co-creation what did we do how
did we do it and here is a sample of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the model or mod menu style approach
included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to receive a example of the
depth curriculum which is this the
[SPEAKER_00]: co-created menu that we did with all of
the suggestions and the speakers and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that I'm happy to share that
and just we'll end by saying that the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that we developed included a lot more
activism and included a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous voices in the speakers and also
movies and other things that were shared
[SPEAKER_00]: and it ended up with a much more
diversified menu of options for the
[SPEAKER_00]: program to use especially because it's a
program that targets Indigenous people
[SPEAKER_00]: that was important to our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that brief time we have one minute
left I'll go ahead and wrap up and share
[SPEAKER_00]: it back with Jenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Roz so real quick the reason why no
one responded in the chat we just got
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Q&A apparently the chat is
disabled for the participants or so or for
[SPEAKER_01]: the attendees so we aren't okay thanks
yeah and we are getting a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in the either getting your
email for curriculum or Jenny has said
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can put it if you share the PDF we
can share it on the website for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off thank you and I'm getting all
of them are like I would love to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it looks like Jenny is going to share
it on the website so I'll go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: send it to her and if you don't see it or
don't know where on the website don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: it on there go ahead and email me and I'll
send it to you directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do think it's important to
you know be putting in perspective how we
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to communities I think to a
large degree we're pretty decent at
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching out to our individual communities
in a lot of ways but it's really important
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to take into account all the
different I don't even know the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: words for it but all the different ways of
communicating styles as well as what is
[SPEAKER_01]: important to our individual communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
you
