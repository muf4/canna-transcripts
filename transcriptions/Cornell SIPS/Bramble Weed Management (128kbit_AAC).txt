[SPEAKER_01]: And now without further ado, we're going
to move into the second phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to introduce our first
speaker, Dr. David Handley works for the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Maine at the Highmore
Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is responsible for vegetable and small
food variety evaluations and integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been a cooperator on this project
and I really appreciate having him here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to speak to us about cultural
control options for Bramble Weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Handley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Laura.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cover the basics of weed
management without chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to of course discuss chemicals
as part of the options as we go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rich Bonanno will get into those
specifically a little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start off and just to introduce the
topic, we need to understand exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: a weed is and what it's doing and how
we're going to manage it based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A weed is basically a plant that's in the
wrong place at the wrong time from your
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that it's going to compete with
those plants for light, nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given that definition, raspberries can
actually become their own worst weed if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not doing a good job of pruning
them and keeping the plant population
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: For they too will compete amongst
themselves for light, nutrients and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raspberries create kind of a special case
for weed management if you're used to
[SPEAKER_02]: growing other crops like vegetables for
example that can make it a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging to get weeds under control and
keep them under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one thing, they're perennial and this
eliminates the opportunity for crop
[SPEAKER_02]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you can't say,
well it was a bad weed year this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to rotate out and do
something different next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that planting is going to be
with you for 10 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, raspberries are shallow
rooted and this means that they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: really suited to close cultivation because
any equipment you have in there disturbing
[SPEAKER_02]: the top layer of the soil is going to harm
the roots of the raspberry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also because they're shallow rooted,
they tend to be very poor competitors with
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can imagine a grass, for example,
and a raspberry planting, their roots are
[SPEAKER_02]: in the exact same spot because over 70% of
a raspberry's root system is in the top 8
[SPEAKER_02]: inches of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also an issue with just about any
perennial weed that's going to be in there
[SPEAKER_02]: directly competing with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raspberries are also herbicide sensitive,
especially younger planting, so the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicides has to be carefully monitored.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only a few chemicals out there
that will control weeds without actually
[SPEAKER_02]: harming the raspberry plants and Rich will
talk about this later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your options are fairly limited in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the keys of having a successful
weed management program in raspberries is
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that you get off on the right
foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're talking about here is
pre-plant weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really the cornerstone of a
successful weed management program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this should begin anywhere from one to
three years before you plant a single
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberry in the ground, depending on what
condition the site is in when you get
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about the types of things
that need to go into pre-plant management,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about looking at site
selection, what amendments you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: add to that soil and how that's going to
impact weeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to use cover crops,
what cover crops you're going to use and
[SPEAKER_02]: what sort of strategies you're going to
use with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The possibility of fallowing before
planting, in other words, keeping that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil bare for a year or two to try to
deplete the weed seed population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as we get ready to plant,
using some techniques to keep the weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: down in that planting year, such as stale
seed beds or strip tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll cover each of these in a little
more detail as we move along.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at site selection specifically,
one of the things you want to do when you
[SPEAKER_02]: decide you're going to plant raspberries
and where you're going to plant
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries is to take a look at that site
and determine what's happened there
[SPEAKER_02]: previously with an eye toward weeds
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, what previous crops have you
had there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a big difference whether
this was a well-tilled and well-managed
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable planting as opposed to a
neglected pasture for the last 20 years in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of what types of weeds you're going
to be facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking at that ground,
what sort of weed history?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know there's a particular perennial
weed that's been a problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quackgrass or nutsedge, for example,
that is going to cause a special issue for
[SPEAKER_02]: you if you're trying to plant a perennial
crop like raspberries in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also take a look at the weed
management history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if this has been a corn field or
something where herbicides have been used
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past, try to get an idea of what
chemicals have been used and how recently
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been used and whether or not
there's any plant back restrictions that
[SPEAKER_02]: might cause a problem with the plants
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only weeds, but the potential for
herbicide residue could be an issue for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take a close look at that site
for what existing weed species there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only annual weeds, which might be
relatively easy to control, but especially
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial species that might be in there
that need to be controlled before we start
[SPEAKER_02]: planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can develop a strategy to get them
out of there before those plants go in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay special attention to whether or not
there's wild brambles in there for not
[SPEAKER_02]: only the reason that these can be a
challenging weed to get rid of,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they act as disease hosts,
especially viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wild brambles really need to be
controlled before you put any of your
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated varieties in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What soil amendments are you going to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: We often add soil amendments to try to
build soil organic matter and improve the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient holding capacity of the soil and
soil drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we use animal manures, these can
often contain weed seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse manure is popular in my area,
and unfortunately horses are very poor at
[SPEAKER_02]: processing weed seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, unless the animal manure
has been composted, you can be spreading
[SPEAKER_02]: millions and millions of weed seeds on
your ground as you think you're helping it
[SPEAKER_02]: by trying to get some organic matter built
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ways you can get around this is
to try to compost any manures that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost, however, also can contain weed
seed unless it's properly done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, that compost should have
been warmed up to at least 140,
[SPEAKER_02]: preferably 150 degrees to kill most of the
weed seeds that's in there and regularly
[SPEAKER_02]: turn to make sure that there's a uniform
product throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I hate to see is people
saying they're going to put compost on and
[SPEAKER_02]: you walk over the compost pile and you can
see knee-high weeds growing on the pile
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's been sitting there for
several months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not going to be able to use
the compost right away, you should either
[SPEAKER_02]: turn it regularly or cover it to make sure
that weed seeds aren't blown on and start
[SPEAKER_02]: to get established and then drop their own
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move into site preparation,
one of the things you may be considering
[SPEAKER_02]: is cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, cover crops are typically added to
build soil organic matter, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: also promoted as a strategy to reduce weed
seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: While they do improve soil structure,
whether or not they reduce weed pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: is really up to you and how you manage
those cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying you're putting a cover crop on
there doesn't mean you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: good weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although cover crops can shade out some
species, some may survive quite well
[SPEAKER_02]: beneath the canopy and you just need to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't see them there and,
indeed, they're shedding seeds and adding
[SPEAKER_02]: to the weed seed bank instead of depleting
it, as you would like them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, in discussions with Rich
Bonanno, who you'll be hearing from later,
[SPEAKER_02]: we feel that unless they're managed very
well, cover crops can actually have little
[SPEAKER_02]: impact on the total weed seed population.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we use short-term cover crops,
in other words, two, three, or maybe even
[SPEAKER_02]: four crops over a summer and combine these
with repeated tillage, you're much more
[SPEAKER_02]: likely to get some impact on the weed seed
bank over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other strategy you can use is select
cover crops that have some allelopathic
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics, such as rye or Sudax,
and these can give off root exudates or
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals within the roots that actually
inhibit weed seed germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in that, I suggest
you look at some of the literature that's
[SPEAKER_02]: out there on allelopathic species and
determine whether or not this is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's actually going to work for you in
the particular situation that you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some of the cover crop options.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to spend a lot of time on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back to this later,
but these are some of the more popular
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at things like buckwheat,
for example, is very easy to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually has very good weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with buckwheat is it doesn't
offer you very much in the way of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, and if you allow it to go to seed
before you get it down, it itself will
[SPEAKER_02]: actually become one of your worst weed
headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oats are also a very popular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing about oats is that they
winter kill, so you don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about trying to kill them and having them
come back on you, but they don't tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: do a particularly good job at choking out
weeds unless you seed them very thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch white clover is not one I'm a big
fan of, but people like it because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: legume and can add some nitrogen to the
soil, but you find over time it's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to establish so that weeds can
come up and kind of get in there and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: before the white clover actually becomes
well established.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Dutch white clover itself can become
a weed issue, and raspberries is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants that will happily grow through
a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red clover is one I would suggest if you
have a hard pan situation because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: very deep root and can crack and break
open some hard pans, but it really takes
[SPEAKER_02]: two seasons to get established.
[SPEAKER_02]: Annual ryegrass, don't let the name fool
you, this one will act as a perennial in
[SPEAKER_02]: some situations, but it's one that people
are starting to look at as a good miner of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, bringing soils back up to the
surface and then reincorporate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter rye is one that gives very good
cover and offers pretty good shading and
[SPEAKER_02]: choking out of weed species, but it is
winter hardy and it will have to be killed
[SPEAKER_02]: either by tilling or using herbicides in
the springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, sorghum sudan is another
one that has some allelopathic qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one produces a lot of vegetative
growth, and you might need special
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment just to plow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just taking a look at a slide here,
you can see the top slide is winter rye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a good stand of winter rye,
unless you've got a good mower,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be difficult to put down in
the springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, this one will overwinter and
will go to seed, and you need to mow it
[SPEAKER_02]: down before that seed matures.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the bottom slide, you see sorghum
sudan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this isn't something you're going
to do with a hand mower or a weed wacker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have good equipment and a bush
hog to be able to get this down,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can just see the amount of organic
matter you're working into the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: the potential for choking out weeds there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's move into getting actually
ready for planting these.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we've hopefully overcome most of the
more serious weed problems, we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to plant these, and we want to plant
them in such a way that we're not actually
[SPEAKER_02]: encouraging more weed growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ways to do this as we approach
the planting here is to maybe fallow it
[SPEAKER_02]: for the season before planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just a case of using repeated
tilling, tillage throughout the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season, not allowing anything to grow on
that soil for an entire season.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good way of depleting the
annual seed bank, because you till,
[SPEAKER_02]: you bring up more weed seeds, they
germinate, you till again before they go
[SPEAKER_02]: to seed, you keep bringing up more weed
seeds and killing them out before they
[SPEAKER_02]: have a chance to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get ahead of perennial weeds,
such as quackgrass this way, by
[SPEAKER_02]: continually bringing up the root system,
dehydrating them, not allowing them to get
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead of them, and basically depleting
those plant reserves in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problems with fallowing is that it's
somewhat energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a little hard on the soil
structure, because you're not really
[SPEAKER_02]: adding organic matter to that,
and you're regularly stirring up the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking up some of those clods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a lot of organic matter in
the soil, this shouldn't be too big an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue doing this for one season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Erosion, of course, is a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on a slope, for example,
and water is going to pull your soil off,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you're in a particularly windy area,
you'd be surprised how much soil you can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually lose by wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fallowing is a strategy that can work
fairly well for getting rid of some nasty
[SPEAKER_02]: weed problems without having to use
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we're getting ready to plant,
there are some other strategies we can
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stale seed bed is one that's popular with
vegetable growers, but could also be used
[SPEAKER_02]: with a perennial crop, such as
strawberries or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we prepare the ground either
in the fall or the early spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: all set, nice and tidy, ready for
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the spring, we allow that soil to
sit, and weed seed starts to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two to four weeks here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably more likely four to six
weeks that you allow those weeds to start
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up, but not to the point where
they're going to be flowering or settling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we kill those weeds back either with
a contact herbicide or flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't disturb the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we're not cultivating
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just killing out what's on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't disturb the soil surface,
we're going to prevent new weed seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: surfacing and basically keep that soft
layer of soil acting somewhat as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we plant, keeping the soil
disturbance to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just plant right in the plant rows,
the area between your rows, which in the
[SPEAKER_02]: case of raspberries is a good eight to 12
feet, a good bit of soil surface there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Undisturbed, and that should keep your
weeds under control anyway from a few days
[SPEAKER_02]: to weeks, depending on how much rain you
get, anything else that might disturb the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil surface, and how much of a weed seed
bank you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, seed beds can be a good way of
getting your plants off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you a few days to a few weeks of
relatively weed free conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not going to be true of where
you've disturbed the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every place you've dug a little hole or
dug a trench to put those plants in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to see weeds starting to come
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will have to have some other
strategy for that, such as hand pulling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stripped tillage is another thing that's
being looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're seeing a lot of this being
used in vegetable crops, but there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: reason it couldn't work with perennial
crops such as raspberries or strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, again, we prepare the ground
in the early fall, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_02]: we seed a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most popular one is winter rye,
but we can also use annual rye or oats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this crop will grow up during the
late summer and fall of that previous
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in the springtime, we go through and
kill that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in the case of oats, they winter
kill, so we don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of the annual rye or the
winter rye, we would probably have to use
[SPEAKER_02]: a post-emergent contact herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gramoxone is typically used, but there
might be something like paraquat as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich can speak to this a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then without barely disturbing that plant
residue, we leave the residue there to act
[SPEAKER_02]: as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We till narrow strips through the dead
cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: This does require specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a picture of that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just plant the raspberries
right into these strips.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dead vegetation inhibiting its weed
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also tends to keep the soil kind of
cold, so you may see that this delays a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit the emergence of new primocanes
and root growth in your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But raspberries are pretty tolerant of
cold soil temperature, so I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: this would be too big a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a picture of a strip tiller going
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it was also a fertilizer
injector on the back of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we see here is that there's just
a series of deep tillage blades here,
[SPEAKER_02]: some blades that go down deep and then a
couple of little coulter blades that just
[SPEAKER_02]: roll behind and bring that, stir that soil
surface up to make a decent planting
[SPEAKER_02]: strip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the strips here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, of course, those strips are
far closer than we'd have them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberry situation, but you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this works fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that residue is going to hang
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of rye, it would hang around
probably through most of the planting
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of oats, you'll probably find
that residue will break down by about
[SPEAKER_02]: halfway through the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as we move into the planting year
itself, it's important to understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: we really want no competition,
plant competition for the raspberries in
[SPEAKER_02]: that planting year.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I hate to see is going
into an established turf and then carving
[SPEAKER_02]: out some narrow rows with a rototiller and
then planting our raspberries into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frequently, those turf species are fairly
aggressive and will move back in and
[SPEAKER_02]: become the predominant plant right over
your raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really prefer to see that there be no
competition in the planting year between
[SPEAKER_02]: the rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we can keep that area between the
rows clean with shallow cultivation or
[SPEAKER_02]: with flaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are good flame weeders out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have to be directed so that the
flames aren't going to burn the
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of raspberry plants you've
put in there, so there'll have to be some
[SPEAKER_02]: shielding involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within the rows, we can either use
hand pulling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that won't be too big a job if we've
done a good job of pre-plant weed
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there are some detail cultivators out
there that will do a reasonably good job
[SPEAKER_02]: between the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't get you completely out of hand
weeding, but they will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some of those cultivators,
just taking a look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a budding cultivator that you see
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you see is the plant actually runs
through this series of wheels with fingers
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that these can get quite close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these little tines just disturb the
top inch or two of the soil, keeping those
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the toolbar you can see here is
set fairly low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is only going to work well if
you're using plug plants for your
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also if you use dormant canes,
as long as you cut the handle off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be able to get a couple of good
weeks of use out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reggie weeder that you see here is
very similar in that we have two spinning
[SPEAKER_02]: heads with fingers on them down here that
will get rid of a lot of the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have handles up here that we can
bring in or out and make those heads go
[SPEAKER_02]: closer or further away as we approach the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also will work fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you see we have a little more
clearance here, so we'll probably be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to use this throughout, I would guess,
most of the planting year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there'll still be some hand weeding to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of using cultivators between the
rows and in the aisleways, we can just use
[SPEAKER_02]: a broad cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Lely tine cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does a pretty good job of just
disturbing the top inch or so of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does a very good job of keeping the
weeds down, provided that you're using
[SPEAKER_02]: this before the weeds actually break the
soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call this blind cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get these weeds under control
while they're still in what we call the
[SPEAKER_02]: white thread stage, before they've
actually emerged from the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has to happen about every 10 to 14
days, depending on how much moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting, just going through there
and raking this over the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we see a flame weeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many different sorts of this,
but many heads on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could go between the rows with some
propane tanks in the back leading to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's ignited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flames just go over and burn them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you don't have to toast the whole
weeds with a flame weeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to go over them very
quickly, and the cells will basically
[SPEAKER_02]: explode and kill those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about mulch, actually,
between the rows, using that space between
[SPEAKER_02]: the rows and covering it up with mulch if
we don't want to cultivate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we're using strip tillage,
the residue's already there acting as a
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch, so that will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could apply straw between the rows,
but it's going to be fairly expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not recommend using mulch hay,
because this is loaded with weed seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll have a lovely hay crop coming
up in your raspberries the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Landscape fabric can also be used,
but it's very expensive, and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain because dust and dirt will be
dragged on there by your equipment and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any place that happens, you're going
to have weeds starting to grow through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also extremely costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only place I've seen landscape fabric
used to any effect is under high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it really has a place out in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, the cost is very high,
and the maintenance can be also quite
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a strategy you can use if you're
only using a small planting to mulch
[SPEAKER_02]: between the rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also heard people say that they'd
like to try to get some row crops between
[SPEAKER_02]: there, such as beans or one of these other
vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: These can be used, again, as long as
you're keeping them far enough away and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't feel that they're going to be
competitive with the raspberries
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about within the row?
[SPEAKER_02]: Within the row, mulch is also an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straw can be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has actually been shown to be very
helpful, especially around plug planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I say this with an important
caveat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The straw does need to be removed in the
fall, so we can put it over the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: right after planting in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do need to remove it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for this is that through the
winter and the early following spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: what will happen is it keeps the soil very
cold and wet and tends to make the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: very susceptible to phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvin Pritz did a nice study on this a
few years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would recommend is go ahead and
use straw around the plants to try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds from growing right around the
plants, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember to take it off because you
want that soil to dry out as quickly as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, using raised beds can also
help you in this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wood chips and shavings can also be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little bit heavy for using in
the planting year, and they will delay the
[SPEAKER_02]: emergence of the primocanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you feel that you've got a long
growing season ahead of you and you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, vigorous plants, a light application
of wood chips or shavings could be
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of sawdust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sawdust tends to have too fine a
particulate in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, you'll find that
the water does not penetrate very well
[SPEAKER_02]: through sawdust.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it'll bounce right off and water
the weeds on the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would recommend is if you're
going to use sawdust, blend it with some
[SPEAKER_02]: wood chips or shavings or try to help that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a source of good,
clean compost, this can be used as a
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that in the lower slide here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried this myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got very good weed control
throughout most of the first growing
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with compost, of course,
is it's actually a pretty good media for
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to grow on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a lot of weed seeds blowing
in, it can result in some problems for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the compost itself is quite clean,
and you don't have a lot of weed seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing in, this can actually provide a
good surface cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover up any weed seeds that are in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, over time, as it's breaking
down, provide nutrients for those growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often get questions about using pine
needles or leaves or these sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually if we've got a big planting,
the issue here is with supply and cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really worth your time to go and
rake all those things out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pine needles are a great mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll work terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is whether or not you can
get enough of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves, I'm not so fond of them unless
they've been broken up because they tend
[SPEAKER_02]: to, again, mat down around the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it wet and can lead to phytophthora
problems, as opposed to pine needles,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are nice and porous and dry out
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you're going to talk about it
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Molly Shaw has a question about
leaving the mulch in place if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting on ridges or raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: With straw, I would say no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The evidence is pretty clear that straw
mulch just is really bad as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: phytophthora is concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using something that's more
porous and allows air through it so that
[SPEAKER_02]: it will warm up more quickly, such as the
shavings that we talked about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But straw mulch, in my opinion,
is fine for the planting year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even with raised beds, I would be
inclined to take it off the year after
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, of course, you feel it's broken
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's degraded enough that it's not
really going to be causing you any issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: in that case, you could probably leave it
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about plastic?
[SPEAKER_02]: We get this question a lot about using
plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, it's a little bit
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at something between
anywhere, depending on what types of
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic you use, $600 to $1,000 an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I should pull that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a little bit less than that
because you're not using quite as much in
[SPEAKER_02]: a raspberry planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on what sort of plastic
you're using and how long you want that
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic to last.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have found with shallow-rooted
perennial plants like raspberries and
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries that we do get a little
inhibition of roots right near the surface
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think this is because the
temperature gradient under the mulch is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit different than it would be
under bare soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, it doesn't seem to have a
huge impact on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will inhibit primocane growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just lay black plastic out there,
punch some holes in it and plant through
[SPEAKER_02]: those holes, remember that your new
primocanes are going to be coming up from
[SPEAKER_02]: root buds further away from those
initially planted crowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after those plants have been in for a
couple of weeks, you will need to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: slit down the middle or maybe cut out a
strip about a foot, a foot and a half wide
[SPEAKER_02]: to allow those new primocanes to come up
or else you're not going to get good plant
[SPEAKER_02]: growth from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the biodegradable mulch may offer a
good answer here in that you can put these
[SPEAKER_02]: mulches down and then they will start to
degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with these so far is that
they're usually designed to last perhaps a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit longer than we'd want them to
in order to get those primocanes up and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd want to take a look at the
biodegradable mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually rated on how long they
will last before they start to degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may want to go with one that will
start to degrade relatively early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear in mind that they're going to degrade
all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't going to give you protection
on the edges like you'd see with the more
[SPEAKER_02]: permanent mulches you see in this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually under a high tunnel in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the biodegradable types are more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they're somewhere between two or
three times the cost of the regular black
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But black plastic can be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bear in mind that you've got to make
room for those primocanes to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be a little pricey,
but it may be a cheap way out if you
[SPEAKER_02]: consider how much it costs you to go
through there and do hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now let's move into actually the
years after planting as we move into years
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three, four, and five as we're
getting this planting established,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are some options for weed control as
we move through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the options is to keep this clean
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way that a lot of growers
handle this in the larger raspberry
[SPEAKER_02]: growing regions of the country where the
crop is mostly harvested for processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we keep those weeds down in the
areas, both in the Iowa's and in the row?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, frequent light tillage as we've
already talked about in the planting year
[SPEAKER_02]: using flamers is another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it'd have to be directed so that
we're not burning the raspberry plants
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand pulling, practical in the row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's very practical in the
aisle ways there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, just the idea of clean
cultivation here is fairly going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be difficult with
perennials, especially if you've got one
[SPEAKER_02]: that's snuck in there or was already
established in there before you got
[SPEAKER_02]: planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Erosion is going to be a problem for you
here, again, if you're on a slope or
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dust can also be an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're cultivating in there when the
fruit are ripe, you're going to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: dust issues on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other issue we have with dust,
if you're planting is quite dusty,
[SPEAKER_02]: it tends to be a real issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: A real attraction for two spotted spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something else to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a possibility if you think you've got
the equipment and time to manage this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way of going at this is looking at
using clean cultivation in the summer but
[SPEAKER_02]: then planting a fall cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we talked about in the previous
slide, during the summertime we would use
[SPEAKER_02]: frequent light tillage to keep the weeds
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we would seed a crop of oats in the
late summer or early fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the time we're finishing up harvest
of our summer floricane bearing variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oats will winter kill and then the
residue acts as a mulch in the spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to what we talked about with strip
tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer tillage is still going to be needed
because the oat residue will probably
[SPEAKER_02]: break down and weeds will start to grow
through it before the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll probably find you have to till
one or two times before you can re-seed
[SPEAKER_02]: the oats next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear in mind, if you're going to grow
oats, you are going to have to put some
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer down there for them in order to
get them established.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just keep planting them and
expect them to do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This might not be practical for
primocating fruit varieties because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be seeding those oats and having
it come up about the same time that you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be in there doing harvesting and
other operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may not be able to establish a good
cover crop in there with the primocate
[SPEAKER_02]: fruiters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something to be looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Pritz has done quite a bit of work
with this in strawberries and found that
[SPEAKER_02]: it can work very well there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any reason why we couldn't
expand that into raspberry production as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is most commonly done here in the
northeast is using a living mulch between
[SPEAKER_02]: the rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just a turf grass established
in those aisleways but not allowed to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into the plant rows themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we leave about a three to five foot
strip, a bare strip, in the plant rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can point that out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this area in here has no grass growing
in it, or so we hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the aisleways themselves have a
perennial grass species growing in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't want to see this put in prior
to the plant going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, I don't want any competition in
the planting year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally what I recommend is that this
be sown in August or September of the
[SPEAKER_02]: planting year or sown in the following
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally what we want to see used here is
a weak perennial grass species such as a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-creeping hard fescue or perennial rye
or a mix of those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are slow growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to be slow to establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to be patient with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may have to control weeds coming up
through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they have enough nitrogen,
eventually they will cover the crop pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well and be able to out compete most of
the weeds that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to use a conservation mix or
a contractors mix or a pasture mix because
[SPEAKER_02]: these contain very aggressive rhizonomous
grass species that will quickly become
[SPEAKER_02]: your worst weed problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't really care to use clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it does add nitrogen to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clover can also become a weed problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will grow through mulch, so it is
difficult that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can also carry some diseases that
they will share with raspberries such as
[SPEAKER_02]: verticillium and tomato ring spot fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, clover is going to come in on
its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't panic too much about trying to
control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I certainly don't like seeding it in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once we have this established,
it should be mowed regularly to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that any weeds that are in amongst that
grass is not allowed to grow up and shed
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we keep this grass mowed quite
tight, the grass will survive and the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds will eventually be depleted.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move on to just looking at this,
here we are seeing a crop that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: seeded in the establishment year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see here I've got grass just
starting to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mulched between the rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little heavy for what I'd like
to see in the planting year, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please note the trickle irrigation line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awful nice thing to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And raspberries really helps them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move into the spring of the second
year in this slide, again, you can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: grass getting well established.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that nice interface between
the grass and the mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grass is not encroaching in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can see the clover has come
in on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what about mulch in the rows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Within the rows, again, just like we
talked about in the planting year,
[SPEAKER_02]: wood chips and shavings, once those plants
are established, a good thick layer will
[SPEAKER_02]: do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to use an old pile that has
lots of weed seed in it, but a good fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: pile of wood chips will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be four to eight inches thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can add to this as needed because it
will break down over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, mulch does have some impact on
fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will deplete the soil of the nitrogen
right at the soil surface, and it can drop
[SPEAKER_02]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this can easily be compensated for by
having a soil test, see what you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: add for fertilizer, see what you need to
occasionally add for lime over the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can compensate for any impact on
the soil fertility that this mulch might
[SPEAKER_02]: be having.
[SPEAKER_02]: And overall, this is probably the best way
to control weeds in the planting during
[SPEAKER_02]: those early years of establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as we look at the annual
maintenance of this, as we finish up here,
[SPEAKER_02]: we keep our grass isles mowed tight,
as I said, to prevent any weeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to come up and germinate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't over-fertilize those isles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need a little nitrogen to keep that
grass growing and to prevent other weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you over-fertilize them,
they will become more aggressive and try
[SPEAKER_02]: to get into that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you're going to have to mow more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to control encroachment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those grasses will try to move in on the
raspberry borders, and you can do this
[SPEAKER_02]: either with herbicide strips or with
shielded flamers or just with an edging
[SPEAKER_02]: tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this will hurt the raspberry roots a
bit, but if you're out far enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: it shouldn't have a big impact on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to replenish the mulch
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take a look at it each fall and
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if you need to add another inch next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over time, you'll find as these
raspberries come thick and established,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you see in this slide, they do a pretty
good job of shading out most of the weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are coming in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may find that you can allow that
mulch to get depleted fairly well,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it won't have that cooling effect
on the soil that delays emergence of the
[SPEAKER_02]: primocanes in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be fooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some hand weeding is still going to be
necessary, and it's important to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: area around your planting mowed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're busy mowing in here and
keeping the weed seeds down, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing in from the unmowed area around
your raspberries, you're still going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have weed problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, with our nonchemical weed
control, bear in mind that the average bed
[SPEAKER_02]: life of a raspberry planting is 10 to 15
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I've been in plantings that are
20, 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most common reason for early bed
failure in raspberries is weeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about insects, we talk about
diseases, but weeds are really the reason
[SPEAKER_02]: that a raspberry planting becomes
non-viable economically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're past a success for making sure that
your raspberries are not going to fall
[SPEAKER_02]: victim to weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good pre-plant preparation, as we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using mulch in the rows can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand pulling is going to be necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, vigilance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping an eye on the weed situation as it
develops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't allow any particular weed species to
get ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk through that planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something is starting to develop,
control it before it becomes throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: your planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just point out this last slide here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always find it amusing to be in a
raspberry planting like this where the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds are up to my chest, but the growers
diligently put a Japanese beetle trap on
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, his problem is not Japanese
beetles at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's losing a lot more money to those
weeds than anything the beetles are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I think, Laura,
do you want me to take questions now,
[SPEAKER_02]: or should we let Mitch go ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: For Dr. Handley, this would be a great
time, and he'll still be there at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of Dr. Bonanno's, so if you think of it
then, you can ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just type your question into the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're waiting for people to do
that, I'm going to change the presentation
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I answered your questions about the
degradable mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of anyone who's actually been
working with degradable mulch,
[SPEAKER_02]: other than a few growers who have been
trying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it holds a lot of promise for
raspberries, and my suggestion at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point is if you're interested in the
plastic mulch, as you can find a source at
[SPEAKER_02]: a reasonable price, give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks promising to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My only worry is, again, that it won't
degrade in time to allow those product
[SPEAKER_02]: gains to easily come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to the raised ridges,
I do like raspberries being planted on
[SPEAKER_02]: raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an ideal situation for
raspberries, because it really helps
[SPEAKER_02]: define where the raspberries end in your
aisleways should begin, and that is very
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful as part of your weed management
plan, and it also will help with things
[SPEAKER_02]: like phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just be aware that straw mulch can be,
if a thick straw mulch layer is on there
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spring, it's keeping those roots
wet, it's keeping those roots cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even on raised beds, it could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we've tried the biodegradable
mulch with a few growers and had very
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people thought that they were very
encouraged by it, and then we had other
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that hated it, so it was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there is one question about the best
time to put mulch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the planting year, in my opinion,
if you're using straw, you can put it on
[SPEAKER_02]: right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so light and fluffy that it will
provide some weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going with a heavier mulch,
like the wood chips, I would probably wait
[SPEAKER_02]: until your primocanes have started to
emerge, because if you put it on real
[SPEAKER_02]: thick right off the bat, you're going to
delay that primocane emergence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd probably be putting it on
mid-summer time as we're moving toward the
[SPEAKER_02]: fall, and until that time, we're going to
have to keep the weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much, Dr. Hanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, if you turn off your speaker
or your microphone, I'm going to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rich Bonanno, who is the weed
management specialist for vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit crops at the University of
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich, if you are right there, I'll have
you come on, and you can just take it from
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what I'm going to do is sort of
pick up what David left off and talk some
[SPEAKER_00]: about how herbicides fit into this,
and we'll go through a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: slides here, including some slides on
different weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bramble floor management, David really
talked about two different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is between the rows and also in the
row, and what we are looking at is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides being used in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the row, as David mentioned,
is always cultivation or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: living mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: How wide of a middle, David mentioned
three to five feet, and really what it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to is research has demonstrated
that there's always a benefit from having
[SPEAKER_00]: as much weed-free area or cover crop area
as possible, but there's some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: practical mix there where you want to have
a weed-free area in the crop row,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's issues related to
trafficability, whether it's customers
[SPEAKER_00]: walking up and down or whether it's a
tractor moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people do have something planted
between the crop rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will plant something there,
but if they don't want to mow it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time because of energy constraints,
you can use low rates of something like
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundup, a very low rate, something like
four or eight ounces per acre to go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hurt the cover crop in the spring,
and it doesn't have a lot of competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime, you won't have to mow
it very much, but it still is there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you want to maintain a weed-free
strip in the row?
[SPEAKER_00]: David covered a lot of this, but basically
it's competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadleafs are competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses are incredibly competitive because
they have a very shallow root system and
[SPEAKER_00]: compete most aggressively with those
shallow roots that are there from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bramble planting, and of course weeds
harbor insects, diseases, and unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, and sometimes there can be
allelopathic effects of weeds even to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bramble planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at weed species,
there's a number of different species that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be out there, and they
include summer annual weeds, winter annual
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, biennials, and then various
perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summer annual weeds are more of a
problem in new plantings, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going from an annual culture
system, maybe vegetables or even
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries for that matter, into
something like brambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to control,
though, with many of the residual
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides, and sometimes people,
especially in other fruit plantings,
[SPEAKER_00]: tree fruit plantings, blueberries,
are very into total post-emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even grape growers, I've seen people just
use multiple applications of Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that is of benefit when
you are looking at a total post-emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control option is the presence of
bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bark is what allows you to make multiple
applications of Roundup and to not worry a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about residual herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with something like brambles,
where you're always talking about these
[SPEAKER_00]: canes coming up, nothing is really ever
more than a year or so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really have bark developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always green tissue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-emergence only control practices are
not what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think residual materials are important,
and post-emergence should be really to
[SPEAKER_00]: help clean up problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some summer annual weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include things that you've commonly
seen, common lambsquarters, common
[SPEAKER_00]: ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many summer annual grasses like
crabgrass, for example, and panicums and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter annual weeds can be a problem for
many years into a planting, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: seed production is allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, contrary to summer annual weeds that
germinate in the spring and set their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and drop their seeds in the fall,
winter annual weeds germinate in late
[SPEAKER_00]: summer or early fall, grow through the
winter, or basically stay dormant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then produce seeds the following
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems with a lot of winter
annual weeds being out there, or any cover
[SPEAKER_00]: for that matter, being out there in the
wintertime, is the increased potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: frost damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cleaner soil is under the crop,
the more that soil will warm up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: less impact that frost damage might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to keep in mind in terms
of how clean you want that cover to be
[SPEAKER_00]: under that crop in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you have a lot of winter
annual weeds growing and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: put a residual material down in the
spring, a residual herbicide, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that herbicide will be intercepted by the
leaves of that growing winter annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can cause a problem with getting the
herbicides to work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some common winter annual weeds include
chickweed, field pansy, henbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all these weeds usually start
to germinate after Labor Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can germinate even through mid to
late October, depending on the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biennials are a different kind of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually live for two full growing
seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow vegetatively in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce seed in year two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's usually a full two-year growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, from a practical standpoint,
they cause a lot of the same problems as
[SPEAKER_00]: do winter annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of a winter annual weed is
burdock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or excuse me, a biennial weed is burdock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perennial weeds come in a lot of
different varieties and shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple perennials like dandelions that
just have a taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creeping perennials, which are usually
vining type perennial weeds that have an
[SPEAKER_00]: underground rhizome system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common dandelion, a taproot, reproduces
primarily by seed and does not spread
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetatively for the most part in
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of vining perennial weeds,
they reproduce by rhizomes that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the ground and come up in
various places.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hardest problems to deal with
with vining perennial weeds like fieldbine
[SPEAKER_00]: weed is that they tend to come up in the
spring and will tend to grow up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you wanted to, say for example,
apply Roundup in the fall to control these
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, many times they're up into the
planting of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult to make a
post-emergence application without also
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting the bramble crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quackgrass is an example of a perennial
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can remember how to use the
pointer here, what's specific about
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials is that you not only have these
small fibrous roots, which are right close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant, but you also have these
rhizomes, which are sort of the spaghetti
[SPEAKER_00]: looking things that are sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from these rhizomes that the new
plants can continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key characteristics of
quackgrass of course is it has these
[SPEAKER_00]: little oracles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one way to tell it from a lot of
the other grasses there to know you really
[SPEAKER_00]: have quackgrass and that you have a
perennial species to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for in-row weed management,
we're looking at pre-plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: David covered a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural weed management, mulches and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: David covered physical weed management,
cultivation, and hand weeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
chemical and about pre-plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little bit about herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In selecting the proper herbicide,
you should really know what weed species
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an annual weed or a perennial
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a grass weed or is it a broadleaf
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: The age of the planting matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a new planting or it's one that's
established, especially with new plantings
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially if you're using tissue
culture plants, you have to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful on what herbicides you might want
to use the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older the planting is, the more
they're able to handle herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, soil types, soil type
limitations, some materials say not to use
[SPEAKER_00]: them on very sandy soils or very gravelly
soils, and then also the time of year is
[SPEAKER_00]: important because most of these
applications will go on in the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to a lot of growing of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so to select the proper rate of a
soil applied herbicide, whenever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying an herbicide to the soil to
prevent weeds from coming up, the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: that herbicide is dependent on the type of
soil you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more sandy the soil, the lower the
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavier the soil, the higher the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's based on organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less organic matter equals less of an
herbicide rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A higher percent organic matter would give
you more of an herbicide rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this would be listed on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something just to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a post-emergence material,
something like Gramoxone or Roundup or
[SPEAKER_00]: Post or Fusilade, and we'll get into these
materials in a minute, then it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: what species do you have and sometimes
also the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more material might be required to
control a larger weed than a smaller weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so some general guidelines about
control, about applying herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, we're looking at all
applications that are made to the crop row
[SPEAKER_00]: should be directed to the soil or to the
weeds at the base of the canes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they should avoid green tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using a residual material,
a soil applied material, it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable that you might hit the base of
the canes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going on in the spring before you
get a lot of new canes coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: or really any new canes coming up,
and you are going to be usually applying
[SPEAKER_00]: the material from both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be walking down one side
of the row coming back on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you want to be
conscious of is overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're not
shooting the herbicide to the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're walking down one side and then
coming back and doing the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because right in the center of the row
you'll end up with a double rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever nozzle setup you use,
whether it's an offset nozzle,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a single 110 degree nozzle
that puts out an even rate over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of soil that it touches,
or whether it's a couple of maybe 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degree nozzles that are designed to
overlap each other a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: just make sure that in the center of that
crop row that you're not overlapping to
[SPEAKER_00]: the extent that you have a double rate
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's the list of herbicides
that are registered in brambles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's actually quite a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bigger list than strawberries,
but actually quite a smaller list than
[SPEAKER_00]: would be in blueberries or even in tree
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've broken the list into soil-applied
materials and also post-emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil-applied materials on the left
here, and they've broken up also into two
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first are materials that are
particularly good on broadleafs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not particularly good on grasses,
and they include cassaron, princep,
[SPEAKER_00]: simazine, and cinbar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The materials that are very good on annual
grasses will control some broadleaf weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are not as good as the three materials
I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include solicam, devrinol,
and surfland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically have three materials that
are great on broadleafs, three materials
[SPEAKER_00]: that are great on grasses, and in most
cases you would use one of each,
[SPEAKER_00]: one from each category combined usually in
the spring, and we'll talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, and that's what gives you sort
of broad spectrum weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gallery here is a broadleaf material
similar to princep and simazine and
[SPEAKER_00]: cinbar, but it's only registered on new
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a material that is used predominantly
in nursery production and doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of presence in fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not registered for bearing years,
but just for non-bearing years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to keep in mind as an
alternative really to either princep or
[SPEAKER_00]: simazine or cinbar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other side here we've got
post-emergence materials, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: broken up actually into three categories
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post- and fusillade are both
post-emergence grass materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are designed to control grasses,
but only after the grasses are up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got good activity on annual
grasses, but limited activity on perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touchdown and roundup are both
post-emergence materials that are broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they'll control both
grasses and broadleafs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also control annual weeds as
well as perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a summer annual or a
winter annual or a biennial or perennial,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless if it's a creeping perennial or
a taproot perennial, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf or a grass, these materials have
excellent activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touchdown is only registered in the
non-bearing year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundup can be used at any time,
but also remember these materials will
[SPEAKER_00]: have activity on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so small canes coming up or excessive
contact with the foliage and even contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the base of the canes can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation is that touchdown and
roundup really should be used for control
[SPEAKER_00]: of perennial weeds and probably spot
treatment or individual hand treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than any sort of broad spraying on
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last three materials, gramoxone,
also known as paraquat, scythe,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a material that's made from sheep
fat actually, but it's not armory approved
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I can tell, and also rage,
which is a new material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all burned down materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not translocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not go down to the root system and
kill perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply burn the tops of the weeds
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have some benefit, for example,
if you want it to burn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small winter annuals if you wanted to have
a clean cover under the crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime, but they will also burn
perennial weeds, but they'll only burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in effect, they're the same as mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the use of these products is
called chemical mowing where you can burn
[SPEAKER_00]: off green foliage, green tissue,
but then especially in the case of a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial, it'll just come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rage is the newest of these materials,
so I just wanted to have a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: slides to tell you about rage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common name is carfentrazone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides post-emergence control of
broadleafs and grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the three post-emergence contact
materials that I mentioned, gramoxone and
[SPEAKER_00]: scythe and rage, will control both grasses
and broadleafs or at least burn all
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses and broadleafs above the soil
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate of carfentrazone or rage is 20 to
40 ounces per acre of the formulated
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you'll add either a crop oil
concentrate at 1%, which means one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: per hundred gallons of spray, or a
non-ionic surfactant at a quarter of a
[SPEAKER_00]: percent by volume, which would be one
quart of surfactant per hundred gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically would direct this to the
base of the plants before bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggest a hooded or shielded
application after bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I frankly am always concerned about any of
these post-emergence materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exception would be the grass
materials, post or fusillade, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: not hurt the canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of whether we're talking about
touchdown or roundup, or whether we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about any of the contact
materials, I still have a little concern
[SPEAKER_00]: about spraying it and contacting the canes
at the bottom, especially if there's green
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a contact type
material, which means that it will burn
[SPEAKER_00]: green foliage, it'll burn green tissue of
any type, but will not translocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other quick thing I guess you should
keep in mind with any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: post-emergence materials, if we're talking
about, I see if I can go back to the list
[SPEAKER_00]: here, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about post or fusillade
or touchdown or roundup, these materials
[SPEAKER_00]: all translocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about how much
water you should use in the application,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less water the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 gallons of water per acre will give you
much greater control than 40 gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water per acre using the same rate of the
chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're talking about a
material that translocates, it goes in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the foliage, it translocates
through the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It not only kills the above ground part of
the plant, but kills the root system as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so more concentrated droplets are the
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about a contact
material, gramoxone, scythe or rage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more water, the better because
coverage is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contact every leaf, every leaf will
turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only contact leaf, leaves at the
top of the canopy, only leaves at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the canopy will turn brown and you
won't get the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, one other possible use of
carfentrazone or rage is to suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation between rows that actually
listed on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three to four ounces per acre of this
product combined with crop oil concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: or non-ionic surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a shielded sprayer, especially if
you're doing it after bud break,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that cannot be used even though you're
only putting it in the row middles here,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot be used within 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so again, I mentioned some of these
already, bramble post-emergence issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green tissue can be hurt and shielding is
almost a necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I wanted to mention
real quick, and I hope it's on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, is what I call a spot or cut
treatment that really makes sense when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about some of the perennial
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, let me say that the original
list of materials that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil residual materials, we're really
thinking about those materials controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: summer annual broadleaf weeds and winter
annual broadleaf weeds, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to perennials, you need some
other measure of control and that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: where the roundup or the touchdown comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a couple more slides before I
talk about the spot treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but David mentioned some about pre-plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the field was an annual culture,
then a cover crop followed by tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and David mentioned this, is really
preferred if there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial weeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David talked about cover crops and
also about fallowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he talked about cover crops,
he talked about multiple cover crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really the preferred method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though, yes, leaving a field fallow
for the whole year and just going in with
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent tillage does a great job of
reducing the weed seed population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really the best thing for the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is very common in organic
production also, is to use multiple cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that if you plant the cover
crop in the spring and you expect at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the season to have fewer weed seeds
than you started at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, you absolutely will not have fewer
weed seeds and I will guarantee you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have more weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea with the multiple cover crops and
the frequent tillage every time the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop gets any real good amount of biomass
is that there's always going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds that are going to germinate and
emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow, even with the cover crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those weeds will then produce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to produce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to go in and disc or provide
some tillage, rototilling, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: before those new seeds, new weeds produce
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing it multiple times,
maybe every eight weeks or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you still get the benefit of having a
cover crop there, but you're also doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job of controlling those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a perennial problem out there,
maybe there was strawberries there before,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there was blueberries or some other
plantings, or maybe you pulled out some
[SPEAKER_00]: apple trees, you have a pretty good chance
of having perennial weeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might still want to use a cover crop
early or late, but you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: attack that perennial weed problem with
roundup in the year before you plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to put yourself into a
situation where you're waiting until the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting year or beyond to start thinking
about controlling perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really should be done the year prior to
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best time to apply roundup is in
the late summer or fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is, is that you're not just
talking about burning off what's above
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to control that underground
taproot, that underground rhizome system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is to apply
that material at a time of the year when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get the translocation
going down to control those weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fall is the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's a broadleaf species like
bindweed, for example, or poison ivy,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any one of these other vines,
any materials, or even dandelions,
[SPEAKER_00]: late summer, early fall, when they're
actively growing, possibly producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive structure like a flower,
you can still get good translocation at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The danger with the broadleafs is you
don't want to wait too late because then
[SPEAKER_00]: if you start having cold weather or a
frost, you will not get the translocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses, on the other hand, can go later
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the north, the rule of thumb is we
always tell people if you're going after a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grass with Roundup, it's not too
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't sat down for Thanksgiving
dinner yet, it's not too late to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: application because those perennial
grasses, especially quack grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard grass, are still usually green and
actively growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only criteria would be is you'd really
like to wait for them to wait for a day
[SPEAKER_00]: where maybe it's going to get into the
high 40s or low 50s, so maybe you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: frost at night or a freeze at night,
but you're going to have a fairly warm
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle of that day would be the best
time to make that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really look at sort of a common weed
management strategy using herbicides in
[SPEAKER_00]: brambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking about using Princep or
Sinbar for broadleaf weeds as a residual
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at using Solacam or Devranol
or Surflan for grass weeds, so annual
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one other thing I'll mention is for
new plantings, Devranol is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: safest material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used on root pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used on tissue culture plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something for the first year,
Devranol might be the better of the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the broadleaf materials,
Sinbar really is not a good option during
[SPEAKER_00]: the transplant year, and if you use any
Princep, it really should be at a half
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really crazy about using Princep
the first year until maybe the first fall
[SPEAKER_00]: of making maybe a half rate application
the first year, and that is in our
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations that are listed as that
you can find online with the UMass website
[SPEAKER_00]: in the New England Small Fruit Pest
Management Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caseron I didn't say a whole lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caseron is not really a replacement for
Princep or Sinbar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Caseron is is a soil applied material
that can do a good job of controlling a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide range of perennial species,
and the reason I want to spend just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute or so on Caseron is because unlike
these other crops that have a lot of bark,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can use Roundup in the fall and
you have bark there and the crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: protected, you need to be really careful
in raspberries because just like the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: will have a better chance of dying in the
fall, if you get Roundup on your raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, there is also a lot of translocation
going on at that time of the year for the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time that you can provide the
biggest danger to your raspberry crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: your bramble crop in general is going to
be with a fall application of Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just have a few perennial weeds
here and there, spot treatments make a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sense, but if you've got a lot of
perennial weeds, maybe you've already got
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop planted, you forgot about
perennial weeds during the fallow year or
[SPEAKER_00]: time has gone by and you've got a lot of
perennial weeds present, maybe you should
[SPEAKER_00]: think about using Caseron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caseron comes as a wettable powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes as a granular formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going after perennial weeds,
the granular formulation makes the most
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wettable powder material does not work
as well as the granular materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key about Caseron application is
probably the best timing would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: late fall, early winter, before the ground
freezes and just before the first
[SPEAKER_00]: snowfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get this material on when the
ground, when the weather is cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: above 50 degrees is not good, it will
volatilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even this time of year, if we have a
little break in the weather, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, maybe there's no snow,
but there's a snowstorm coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still makes sense to put some Caseron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people wait a little bit later,
but when we start getting to a situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where you might have temperatures 50
degrees or higher, it's probably too late
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply the Caseron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we talked about some of these
post-emergence materials, Roundup,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gramoxone or Rage for post-emergence
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Gramoxone and Rage are only contact
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundup, once we get into the
establishment year, because touchdown can
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer be used, is used for perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the spot treatment I mentioned before
is something you won't find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, but I wanted to mention
it real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time when you could buy a
little clipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was called Clip Clean,
both with a K, K-L-I-P, K-L-E-E-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you Google that, you might find
some other products that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these are, are ways to apply a
small amount of Roundup onto the blade of
[SPEAKER_00]: your clipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about using a handheld
clipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use straight Roundup because
it's too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need two parts water, one part
Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically would dip the blade of your
hand clippers into the solution and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut near the base of the perennial weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes this, the good part about
this, let me tell you about the bad part
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad part is it's obviously very
labor-intensive because you're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and you're going to cut every
one of these weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part is it doesn't make any
difference what time of year you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike a foliar application of Roundup,
which is really only going to work late
[SPEAKER_00]: summer or fall to get the translocation,
an application with a clipper in this
[SPEAKER_00]: manner will work at any time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a vining perennial,
for example, that's growing up into your
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, you can go out there in the
spring when it's three or four inches high
[SPEAKER_00]: before it ever grows into the planting and
you can make some cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you take a row this week or this
month and another row next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the course of the growing season,
you can go after it just about any time
[SPEAKER_00]: that the weeds are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has potential for spotting treatment
of perennial weeds without making an
[SPEAKER_00]: application with a sprayer without
potentially contacting the crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: causing problems, but something that is
highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's the list as we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, soil applied post-emergence,
grass materials, broadleaf materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, after I went through the
explanation, that entire list makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more sense about how things fit
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your weed problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch effectively when you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain the middles, as David has
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using herbicides, apply them at
the right time, at the right rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the right equipment to avoid crop
injury and to maximize control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that using residual materials
makes more sense than post-emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: materials in brambles for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotate chemistries means that if you use
one product this year for broadleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: material control, use a different product
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a grass material and you
use surf land this year, use Devonol next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to use the same materials over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please read and follow all label
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the work protection
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply to all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply to conventional materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply to organic materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read and follow all the label directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the work protection standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep yourself, your family,
and your employees safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent job of giving us an overview of
each cultural and chemical weed control
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably one of the best
comprehensive presentations on weed
[SPEAKER_01]: control for bramble crops that I've ever
been at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to just say one thing,
and maybe Rich, you could answer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have gallery touchdown or rage in
our 2010 guidelines, and I just attempted
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to check that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't happen to know whether those are
registered in New York, do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe touchdown is actually,
hopefully the lawyers won't hear this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is exactly the same thing as Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different company, but it only has a
non-bearing label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's exactly the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could certainly use Roundup in the
transplant year if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: touchdown rage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rage is brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that your DEQ has not
approved it yet in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just put it into our new guide,
which will be coming out in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gallery has been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it's a nursery material,
but it is possible that New York has never
[SPEAKER_00]: registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons some people might not
have put it in all their recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason alone, it might not be
in your guide, but it is worth checking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you who are from New York
State, we'll try to make, if any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually legal and able to be used,
we'll try to put that on the Cornell Berry
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and I certainly thank Dr. Bonanno
for letting us know about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that we have some folks who
have questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move into the final phase,
but now's your chance to ask anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on your mind or that you might want
to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We Control for Bramble Crops, very quiet
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that you can actually hear us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you would let us know if you
couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just put the last, the page up here
that has the handouts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: information about We Control for Bramble
Crops that you can download.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one more poll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've got a few people typing some
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll open up this other poll just to get
some ideas about whether or not people had
[SPEAKER_01]: some challenges with the webinar this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff asked about any experience with
wipers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a wiper application is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a cross between making a
spray or using the clippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of effectiveness, it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as a spray will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have the benefit of the
clipping, which will give you the quick
[SPEAKER_00]: translocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly any of these wipers,
they make these little ones that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: hockey sticks with the nylon rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, just as I mentioned before
about the clippers, you cannot use
[SPEAKER_00]: straight Roundup in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to use some water,
because the Roundup is too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not flow through that nylon rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will give you the same effect as if
you were making a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because it's similar to a
foliar application, fall is the best time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many generic glyphosate labels
out there, as Eric has mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen the labels of all of the
generic glyphosate products, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, Roundup is more than 15 or 17
years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is off patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that many of the companies,
especially when they're gearing towards
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable and fruit growers, have tried to
make the labels very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, if you buy any of the
generic glyphosate products, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that these crops are actually listed on
those labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one other person typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he's typing to the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to let you know, if you do type
your question into the whole group,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be recorded during the archive
recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone will be able to see it later,
and that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to thank both of our
speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give a few more seconds and see if
this question is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank our speakers for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank all of you attendees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some challenges, at least on my
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some video and audio challenges,
but it doesn't look like it was too bad
[SPEAKER_01]: for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate you hanging in there with
us in case you did lose audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that question was not for the
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so I guess there's no more
questions coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will leave this web page open so that
those of you who would like to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to download handouts can do that
for a few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Dr. Bonanno and Dr.
Handley, for being with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the rest of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we'll see you for the next
Barry webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Bramble Disease Management
webinar on February 3rd at 1 o'clock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't hesitate to give me a call or
send me an email if you have some
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about running the webinars or
registering for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
