[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ruby Wenzel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use she heard pronouns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the policy and research manager at
climate exchange, and I will just pull up
[SPEAKER_01]: my slides, start the slideshow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will primarily focus on the
dashboard, but also wanted to give an
[SPEAKER_01]: overview of who climate exchange is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have three programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So climate exchange is an organization
focused on state level climate mitigation
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are do have a 50 state scope,
but don't really work on local policy or
[SPEAKER_01]: federal policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is primarily at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a mission to achieve a rapid and
equitable transition towards zero
[SPEAKER_01]: emissions economy by advancing state
climate policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do this through three programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our state climate policy network,
or a CPN, our state climate policy
[SPEAKER_01]: dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a pro bono policy
assistance program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first up, the CPN is a network of over
15,000 advocates, legislators,
[SPEAKER_01]: government officials, business leaders,
researchers, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of people working on climate
policy and kind of related issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: policies in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking to reduce emissions and put
forward strong and equitable policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have all 50 states represented in
the network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do also have a lot of people who are
interested in learning about state policy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that might not be their main focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have people who primarily focus on
local policy, federal policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bulk of our network is state
policymakers and NGO advocates.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple pieces of programming that we do
through the CPN.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have monthly webinars, sometimes more
than one a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: These kind of provided a deeper dive into
a specific topic or policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had one last week on data-driven
climate communications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes they're more broad,
but other times they do focus on specific
[SPEAKER_01]: policies like methane abatement,
or we have a transmission focused series
[SPEAKER_01]: on how state policy can kind of reform and
build out the country's transmission
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have monthly national calls the
last Wednesday of every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where people on the ground in
their states will provide updates on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in their state,
what are the most relevant bills under
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration, rules, regulations,
kind of where folks' attention is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate movement in their states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way to connect with people
across the country, learn what other
[SPEAKER_01]: states are doing, how it might be relevant
to your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have expert presentations at
the beginning of those so people can come
[SPEAKER_01]: on and give an overview of a tool or a
board or resource that they'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: share.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a bi-weekly newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll share articles in that policy
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also draft a lot of state and federal
policy updates focused on climate policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another way that we serve to be a
resource to our audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing is you'll see there's the
pro bono policy assistance, access to
[SPEAKER_01]: peers, and expert connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of ties into our assistance
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do provide pro bono policy
assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do anything from provide example
states and model states as well as model
[SPEAKER_01]: rules for a given policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you're interested in solar siting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can provide best practices for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are model rules, we can share
those with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can connect you to folks who do draft
those model rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also help with identifying gaps and
opportunities in your state's climate
[SPEAKER_01]: policy landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a big thing that we do through
the network is provide connections to
[SPEAKER_01]: either experts or other people working in
your state or in other states that have
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe similar policy issues, maybe
economic drivers, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the network and this assistance program
is a great way to get connected to people
[SPEAKER_01]: in your state, get connected to experts,
learn more about specific policies and
[SPEAKER_01]: topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do also like to complete a lot of
these requests ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've helped with landscape analysis,
bill drafting, research to identify best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, all those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can email one of my colleagues,
Kristen, who is our SEP manager,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can also on the dashboard website,
you can direct we request policy
[SPEAKER_01]: assistance through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll make sure you have the links and
our contact information if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a quick example of something
we've done through the assistance program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone who is a new state agency
environmental justice staffer,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what first position of its kind in
a state, reached out for kind of two
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state didn't really have a statewide
strategy to attract federal funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it was a new position created.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of wanted to learn what other
states are doing and how they can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from those best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we identified similar states based on
political and economic contexts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided connections to technical
assistance providers around federal
[SPEAKER_01]: funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do provide technical
assistance to secure federal funding and
[SPEAKER_01]: help strategize around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also identified some best practices of EJ
positions and offices within state
[SPEAKER_01]: governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then provided some connections to
state and local organizations who could
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of help guide the strategy around
environmental justice and a just
[SPEAKER_01]: transition in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also identified connections to people
in similar states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided examples of what an EJ office
or EJ position can look like and
[SPEAKER_01]: identified some kind of similar positions
in other states as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of a different topics,
obviously based on what people request,
[SPEAKER_01]: but kind of a common way we approach
these, both doing in-house research and
[SPEAKER_01]: then connecting folks to relevant actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onto the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the climate exchange also runs the
climate policy dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just call it the dashboard from now
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an online tool that provides
information on 62 state-level climate
[SPEAKER_01]: policies across all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: These policies span seven sectors,
which I'll get into in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's designed to kind of provide an
overview of what your state's policy
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape is and help you identify policy
opportunities to increase your state's
[SPEAKER_01]: climate ambition and reduce emissions
equitably.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of highlights, it's free and
accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, information on 62 policies
across all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want this and make sure that it's
regularly updated and it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ground truth by folks in the network
who are working directly on these policies
[SPEAKER_01]: and in their states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We relaunched the dashboard to its own
site in October of this past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that made it a lot easier to update
it regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the launch in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did a big content update at the
end of January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we're going to do
kind of a six month cadence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next update is planned for June or
July, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big kind of consolidator of
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feature resources from over a hundred
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we crowdsource a lot of
data from the SCPN and from other
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really brief overview of the policy
framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might recognize a lot of these
sector-based policy areas, climate
[SPEAKER_01]: governance and equity, focuses on how
states are setting emission reduction
[SPEAKER_01]: targets, how they're reporting on those,
creating climate plans, building out state
[SPEAKER_01]: government capacity to address climate
policy, environmental justice,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to integrate an EJ into climate
policy, as well as a handful of just
[SPEAKER_01]: transition policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cross-sector focuses on
economy-wide policies and policies that
[SPEAKER_01]: span multiple sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A common one is carbon pricing that can
just be in one sector or it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: economy-wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have electricity, buildings
and efficiency, transportation,
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, and natural and working lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of ways to see that full
policy framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to our methodology page.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an all policies page.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also on a specific state page,
if you scroll down to the big data table,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'll show you in a little bit,
you can see the full list of those 62
[SPEAKER_01]: policies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly on the methodology,
a lot of the information is manually
[SPEAKER_01]: tracked as well as through secondary
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some organizations who contributed
some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do some policy tracking and most
notably Spot for Clean Energy develops
[SPEAKER_01]: policy components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've incorporated some of their
policy components and data into the
[SPEAKER_01]: dashboard as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this shaded map just is
providing a really high level landscape of
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of enacted policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a lot of the well-known
climate leaders are in darker colors and
[SPEAKER_01]: then shading kind of varies across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some key features, you can identify
state policy opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can explore the status of those
policies by state or by policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can identify the whole 50 state
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have four different statuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have enacted, so the policy exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the books in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: In progress is kind of, it's a policy that
has been established, but maybe final
[SPEAKER_01]: rules or regulations or a plan is pending
final approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example of this is in Oregon,
the legislature passed legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: requiring the development of an
environmental justice mapping tool by I
[SPEAKER_01]: think October of next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legislation requires that tool to be
developed, but it's not currently,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's under development now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example of what's in
progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not a policy tracker in the sense
you'll see bills under consideration in
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislatures this session,
but there are some policies where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: required to be finalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do feature some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partially enacted refers to the policies
with components, and it means that some
[SPEAKER_01]: components are fulfilled, but not others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not enacted means it doesn't
exist in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can either just be binary yes or
no for the non-component-based policies or
[SPEAKER_01]: for components.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that zero components are enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also identify key policy
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a feature we're going to be
building out over time, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying the highest impact policies a
state can either enact or increase their
[SPEAKER_01]: ambition for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sort and filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: States and policies by status,
by year, region, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also provide state-specific
summaries and establishing policies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we link directly out to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the dashboard, I found it really
difficult to find all of the actual pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: of legislation, rules and regulations that
establish these policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made it really easy for everyone to
directly find those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And view the policy text itself,
if interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also provide state-level emission
projections through 2050.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is using Energy Innovation and RMI's
energy policy simulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, business-as-usual projections
are featured on the site for most pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we build out the key policy
opportunities, you'll be able to see how a
[SPEAKER_01]: state, if they enacted those
opportunities, how the emission
[SPEAKER_01]: projections could change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also provide a lot of resources to
further your learning and understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the policies and how to enact them in your
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've identified state examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have key resources listed on all policy
pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where they exist, we do also link
out to model rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of template policies
that you can fill in the blanks and adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: the language as needed and as desired,
but really helps with a lot of that policy
[SPEAKER_01]: drafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, you can request
technical assistance directly from Climate
[SPEAKER_01]: Exchange through the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's both more of the policy and
research examples I provided and then
[SPEAKER_01]: connections to experts and advocates in
your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it for the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also aware of the time, but I can
briefly just walk through the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do also want to see where folks are,
if I want to see the next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky, Washington, Minnesota,
Georgia, New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do North Carolina, because there are
some interesting things to highlight
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the homepage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see our... Oh, actually,
I won't do North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca will cover North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do another state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just pull up that list again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do maybe Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a state comparison tool,
so I'll throw in some other states as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go to the policies page,
you just click on policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more about who our
partners and contributors are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The methodology will kind of explain our
policy tracking methods, how we developed
[SPEAKER_01]: these shadings, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see we have definitions of
what those statuses are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just hover over, you can see a
really high level summary of just the
[SPEAKER_01]: statuses across the 62 policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean when it says partially
enacted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like the legislature, but it's in
sign by the governor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go down to electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we do incorporate some spot
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a great resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: They develop policy components that break
a specific policy down into more granular
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of its design.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you can see for the screen
sharing, but if you hover over the bars,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see what those components are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do link out directly to Spot's
website, so you can view the sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see very easily what components
are fulfilled or what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So partially enacted just means that some
components are enacted and some are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it ranges a lot in terms of what the
components look like across states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, looking at just the specific
policies with components would be
[SPEAKER_01]: partially enacted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruby, you're looking right now at
Minnesota's policies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And only of the renewable energy section
or all related to climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I just clicked electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to only look at one policy
area, you could click on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I clicked on electricity and it brought
me down to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's only filtered by the
electricity policy area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to undo that, you could see
it's a full list of the 62 policies kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of presented in the order that I showed on
the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see at least in climate
governance and equity, the state has most
[SPEAKER_01]: policies enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state does have a green bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have carbon pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a clean energy standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to, you could filter by
you're enacted, seeing the most recent
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also expand these rows,
like I said, and see those specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: the policy description in the state,
as well as we do link out directly to
[SPEAKER_01]: those pieces of legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's like a report or some type of
tool, then we do link out to those as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go maybe to a policy page quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we provide a brief summary of the
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you can request that policy
assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the map across all 50 states
and the status.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that's not component-based
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only statuses are enacted or not
enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some key resources that kind of
focus on emission reduction targets,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they can be designed well,
kind of a lot of reports on how states are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing to meet those targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some model states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, for example, is one of the only
states that has targets every five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting 2025 through 2050.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a model state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also highlight some of the more
ambitious states as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is how you could see the full 50
state landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only wanted to see which ones are
enacted, you could filter by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can expand all of them, see how they
compare their targets, what their baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: years are, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a nice feature is you can
download this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's something that you've filtered,
the download will only download the data
[SPEAKER_01]: with the table shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you only want it enacted,
you could specifically download this
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted the full 50 state list,
you could do that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that's nice is you'll
see that the URLs also change as you
[SPEAKER_01]: filter and sort stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to share the list of the
25 states with targets, you could just
[SPEAKER_01]: directly copy this and share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the page will open up to this filter
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will very, very quickly go over the
state comparison tool, because this is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of my favorite features.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can select up to four states and as
many policies as you want and just see a
[SPEAKER_01]: side by side comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also feature the model states and the
model rules on this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do remember Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do maybe buildings and electricity,
maybe some climate governance and equity
[SPEAKER_01]: in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do just emission reduction targets as
kind of a baseline policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe clean energy standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will show maybe a component based policy
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll do maybe like pace to get a
broad sense of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a state comparison tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has the customized URLs if you
wanted to share those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see just a high level side by
side comparison between the four states
[SPEAKER_01]: and the policies I've selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the model states.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to click on that,
it would bring you to a state page again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see there is kind of a variety
in what the programs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgia most recently enacted pace
enabling legislation, whereas Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_01]: Minnesota and Washington, their policies
kind of have their pace programs have been
[SPEAKER_01]: established for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe pace just briefly for
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is pace?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides clean energy financing that's
tied to the property value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a financing mechanism to
make energy efficiency improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see all the states have net
metering partially enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Minnesota and Washington are kind of
the farthest along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in Georgia, the state's utilities
are required to offer a net metering
[SPEAKER_01]: program and distributed generation
technologies are eligible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're missing a lot of the other
components in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I'll just highlight where they
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do also link directly out to the model
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were in Georgia and Kentucky and
said my state doesn't have a clean energy
[SPEAKER_01]: standard or renewable portfolio standard,
but we're interested in that, this model
[SPEAKER_01]: law, for example, could help with a lot of
that baseline drafting and the model
[SPEAKER_01]: language in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to answer questions in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or time permitting at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was wonderful, Ruby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rebecca, will you start your screen share
and I'll put up the poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rebecca Delamora.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a senior policy analyst at the North
Carolina Clean Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, I'm going to go over kind of
what the center does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to get into,
like Ruby did, a kind of tutorial and
[SPEAKER_00]: quick run through of our database desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the Clean Tech Center,
we are an extension center of the College
[SPEAKER_00]: of Engineering at North Carolina State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do public education outreach
specifically related to clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The center as a whole has its hands in a
lot of pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on policy team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a training team, clean
transportation, clean power and industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, AKA engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then across all of those, we just do
in general extension and engagement work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I'm on the policy team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do legislative and regulatory
analysis related to clean energy
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we run the database of state incentives
for renewable efficiency, AKA DESIRE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then associated with DESIRE,
we also have our DESIRE Insight
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription services and our 50 states
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the climate dashboard,
DESIRE is free to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a public good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was originally funded by the Department
of Energy back in 1996, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it's grown a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's free for you guys to use,
but it's not free for us to update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where DESIRE Insight comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our subscription service that
looks at all of the pending legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any bills that are introduced,
any regulatory dockets that are ongoing,
[SPEAKER_00]: any proposed utility programs that haven't
officially been decided yet or officially
[SPEAKER_00]: enacted goes into DESIRE Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's enacted or you have a
decision and it's available for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: use or look at, then it can go into the
full DESIRE database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that, we also do customized
research and analysis upon request,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly for government entities or private
corporations that are interested in clean
[SPEAKER_00]: energy policies across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our training team does workforce
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we host onsite and hybrid trainings
related to clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly focused on the solar industry
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of operations and maintenance,
installation, the business aspect of these
[SPEAKER_00]: types of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our trainings are also aligned
with national standards and certificates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take the courses to learn and
then take the test and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also started a new course specifically
now for solar and storage paired together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually also developing one
specifically for electric vehicle turning
[SPEAKER_00]: stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is our clean transportation team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clean transportation team is
specifically dedicated to electric
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicles and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of technical assistance and
fleet advisory services, both for public
[SPEAKER_00]: and private fleets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of work with local governments,
a lot of working with small companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: help them electrify their company or
government fleets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of education outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also usually about once a month
hold a webinar on some sort of clean
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of ride and drive events
with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every August, they host the
sustainable fleet technology conference
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Raleigh-Durham area,
where fleet managers can come from across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country to kind of learn about what
the situation is like with electrifying
[SPEAKER_00]: fleets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our engineering team,
which we like to call CPI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CPI does a lot of the real
technical assistance and analysis related
[SPEAKER_00]: to on-site energy and a lot of industry
regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can do energy assessments,
feasibility analysis, consulting studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get into the really good degree of
actually helping clients get clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our extension and
engagement work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is on the fee for service
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a client comes to us and they pay us to
do it for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a majority of it is actually through
grant work, whether it's federal grants or
[SPEAKER_00]: state level grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a list of all of the current
major grants that we are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other grants that aren't listed
here that are still running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of grants that have
finished already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to pick out a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one at the top is with our
engineering team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the technical assistance
partnership or the TAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they provide free technical assistance
to commercial and industrial customers who
[SPEAKER_00]: want on-site generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our engineering team also works with
farmers to help them apply for USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for on-site generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grant going on to helping local
governments learn about siting and
[SPEAKER_00]: permitting for utility scale solar and
renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of the Solar for All Coalition
for North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Solar for All is run by the EPA
through, I think it was either IRA or BIL
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's specifically dedicated to
providing incentives for low income
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and customers who live in
multi-family homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get rooftop solar or community
solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our transportation team works with the
Clean Cities Coalition, helping local
[SPEAKER_00]: governments across the Southeast meet the
Clean Cities standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are working on a, I'm working
personally on a grant that's looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: community resilience using solar plus
storage microgrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're working with around 10
communities across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our training team is working with Native
American communities for workforce
[SPEAKER_00]: development in the clean energy sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also developing new training
programs for other people to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like it was really important
for you guys to understand that we do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things in this sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of it is specifically
extension and engagement work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to desire, well,
this is our contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to desire, so like I said
before, Desire is a free online tool for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm gonna go, here, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can see this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Desire website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides information on policies and
programs related to clean energy across
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the national level,
but like the climate exchange dashboard,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we even have utilities and
utility level programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if big enough, some municipal level
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can search by state by clicking on
the map and you can see on the map how
[SPEAKER_00]: many programs might apply to a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mississippi has 23, Kentucky has 33,
North Carolina has 71, California has 158.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually click on a state and
see all of those states policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'll go to North Carolina,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the state websites,
we have kind of a large summary of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the major programs in that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy efficiency, renewable portfolio
standards, footnotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can scroll down and you can see
the list of all of the programs within the
[SPEAKER_00]: state and programs are sorted by what the
name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking just at general
programs, the state, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: financial incentive or a regulatory
policy, the type of incentive or policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the entry was created and then when
the entry was last updated and it defaults
[SPEAKER_00]: to whatever the last update was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our most recent update was February 6th
and it was the South River EMC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an electric cooperating area for
a heating rebate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to check that out,
we can come in to the incentive program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see kind of all the information
that is provided on this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who implemented its utility?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a financial incentive in the state of
North Carolina and it's specifically a
[SPEAKER_00]: rebate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then link to the website,
the main website where you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this links directly to the cooperative
website, the administrator, the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative, the utility, the cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we list the eligible technologies for
the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's solar water heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can take advantage of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Residential, commercial, industrial,
agricultural, low-income residential,
[SPEAKER_00]: multifamily residential, manufacturers,
local government, state government,
[SPEAKER_00]: tribal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of the incentive, the maximum
value of the incentive, if it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the standard incentive value,
any equipment or technical requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: that are needed to actually be eligible to
receive the incentive, and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant, ownership of renewable energy
certificates or credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then below all of that, then we'll have a
quick summary so that you can kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of what the incentive is
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And desire, since desire is aimed towards
the general public, these entries should
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty easy to read and understand even
if you don't know anything about clean
[SPEAKER_00]: energy or solar water heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below that, we always have a
contact for whoever the administrator is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have the information for the
electric cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go directly to them if you have
any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll also have memos that show
you when we updated it and what changes we
[SPEAKER_00]: might have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was last updated by our intern
Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was an annual review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made sure that all the program
details were accurate and up to date based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what the cooperative is offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the types of things you might see in
these programs are going to vary based on
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of program entry it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, let's go, if we just go to all
the programs we have in desire,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see it defaults to what
was most recently updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the intern is focusing on
utility incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can't find something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, regulatory policy, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado, we recently made changes to
the renewable energy standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, while the formatting
is the same, the information included in
[SPEAKER_00]: this table at the top is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have the sector, the category,
the state, incentive type, and the website
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have, because it's a
policy, when did it start, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies that are eligible for the
renewable energy standard, who the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard applies to, investor-owned
utilities, communities, and co-ops,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the standard actually is,
so all of the final goals and targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology minimum that they must
reach, any compliance multipliers or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, the renewable energy
credit lifetime, the tracking system they
[SPEAKER_00]: use, they have an alternative compliance
system set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come down, you can see this
is a lot, the summary here is a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth than maybe that co-op incentive
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, it gets into what the
other technologies were, because not
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is maybe clear if it's just in
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences between the investor-owned
and electric and municipal utilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it applies to generation transmission
cooperatives, any carve-outs they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, to apply to credit multipliers,
compliance requirements, the new clean
[SPEAKER_00]: energy standard that they recently passed
a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here you can see, we also have
the authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cooperative, because it's
cooperative, it doesn't have any legal
[SPEAKER_00]: standards or requirements that it has to
meet or comply with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have any authorities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with things like regulatory policies
or financial incentives that are mandated
[SPEAKER_00]: by regulatory commissions or legislatures,
we'll have the authorities in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go directly to the statute to
see exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we even have executive orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the date that it became
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And scrolling down again, and again,
we have the contact information and the
[SPEAKER_00]: memos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we updated it like five days
ago, and we added the section on the clean
[SPEAKER_00]: energy standard at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what these entries
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the actual types of entries,
we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sort by the technology type
that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're only interested in solar
energy incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you only want to look at
requirements or building efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can choose the type of technology
you want based on all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose the date that it was
updated, that the program was most
[SPEAKER_00]: recently updated, or if we have it the
expiration date of a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Categories, again, basic financial
incentive, regulatory policy, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: program type of which, again, we have a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have face financing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually get into that one if we
want as a comparison going down still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we look for a New York water heater?
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend's water heater just broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can totally do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what she can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can actually search here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't want to scroll again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to apply one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get it updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to go to the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we said technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a water heater should be under
energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know your friend's zip code or a
New York zip code?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's 10463.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search by zip code 106463.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can search by zip code for
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, remember, we have local
utility level programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're like, well, I don't care
about utility programs or utility that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't for me, you can filter those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, now we have 74 programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That match this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all local.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this zip code will be saved once I
apply the filter for water heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have 15 programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, we do have federal
programs mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all federal programs are going to
be eligible across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to show up for every
single zip code in every single state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I want us to see only ones
that are from the state or city of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a rebate program with NYSERDA,
which is an assisted home performance with
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what that's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an incentive that can cover 50%
of costs for, let's see, grants for low
[SPEAKER_00]: income homeowners in single and
multifamily buildings for 50% of costs for
[SPEAKER_00]: energy efficiency improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if this applies to your friends,
you can go straight to the website to see
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what is available for her at this
NYSERDA program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that is one thing that I think
is important is you can search by zip
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search by the implementing sector
of a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it administered by the federal
government, a local government,
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofit, a state or utility,
the eligible sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have it split mainly into
residential and non-residential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cover just all residential,
standard, single family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multifamily, low income, things that are
specific to senior citizens,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-residential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have commercial, industrial,
agricultural, the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do something with agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me clear here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clear these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that zip code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is back to the main program
and I have it sorted by state now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alaska shows up first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said agricultural, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So eligible sector, non-residential,
business, agricultural programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 400 programs where someone in
the agricultural sector is eligible to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, we have Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a sustainable alternative
power program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska has net metering rules that allow
for agricultural customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alabama agricultural customers are
eligible for Alabama's PACE program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of things that you can
search up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can search by state,
technology type, and the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a zip code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all just, and that's just the
main part of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the climate exchange dashboard,
there's lots of other things you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacy has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacy, what state are you from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you put in the state?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you filter by county, does it only pull
county specific?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only pull county specific or also the
state the county is in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if you put in county,
do you lose your state incentives?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do something in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need an Arizona zip code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in his Arizona zip code, Stacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to tell me because I can't
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: 86305.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like, so it is going to be
statewide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll still, because when you put in
the zip code, it's going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that that zip code could take
advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that includes anything that is only
local specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes federal programs, and it also
includes state level programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see if the zip code has anything
like, yeah, like here, like if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: APS, the Arizona public service utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has those in there because you
can take advantage of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then not, we don't always
have the zip code listed in a program just
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes it can be very difficult
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a team of seven people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have zip codes memorized for
every single utility and municipality in
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do try to when it's a local utility
program to kind of put those in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so when you search for zip code,
it will always include statewide and
[SPEAKER_00]: nationwide programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, wow, that's a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have summary maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these summary maps, you can choose
a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go building energy codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how many states have
incentive and desire for building energy
[SPEAKER_00]: codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas has nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even sort by technology,
which I'm not going to do because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: building energy codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually export them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember actually messing around
with this part before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here under the summary tables,
which you can find under the overarching
[SPEAKER_00]: programs tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these are all the incentive
types that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click one, let's, okay,
we want a bond program, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can see all of the bond programs
that we have listed in desire,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I want to show you guys all the
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And resources that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the overarching resource
views.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list of all the publications and
presentations that we've done as a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all like the PowerPoints
where we presented at conferences over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I use all the time as our detailed
summary maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are kind of annually updated
maps that provide information on one
[SPEAKER_00]: specific policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go with energy storage targets
because that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download it as a PowerPoint or a
PDF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have the map of states that
have energy storage targets as of
[SPEAKER_00]: September, 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colored in if it has a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a final target there
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty new program,
a new policy type we've been seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always interesting to see like
what states are adopting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the summary map, we also have a
list under other resources of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take advantage of or look into
related to energy, national, federal,
[SPEAKER_00]: state, regional, international,
and other energy tools you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably put yours on there,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring it up to the team so they can
get the climate exchange dashboard on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look, I think,
under help and support, if you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our frequently asked questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't even have a glossary of
all the programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we were bringing up PACE before,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, if you're like, I don't know what
PACE financing is, now you can find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is, what happened, Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out what a loan program is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out here what a renewable
energy credit is or a solar renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: energy credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our FAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you still need help,
we have our 20 minute presentation of how
[SPEAKER_00]: to use Desire, which also gets more in
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is mostly everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that was useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any requests that they
want us to search on either of these
[SPEAKER_02]: platforms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them in the chat, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll ask the two of you to sort of
speak to each other about how can we as
[SPEAKER_02]: extension professionals improve the
communication with our communities in
[SPEAKER_02]: order for helping our communities access
these resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like specifically, like I will share with
my friend how to find her water heater
[SPEAKER_02]: incentives, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have had this experience for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the ways to help people
connect the dots for local action with
[SPEAKER_02]: local resources and policies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, from a Desire standpoint,
I actually do know a lot of government
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies or local governments or utilities
might actually link to the Desire website
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're like, if you want more
information on incentives, check out this
[SPEAKER_00]: website here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I see them, like,
oh my God, that's us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one way is like, if you know
someone is going to your website
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly, like, you know, the state
government knows if someone's looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: a tax incentive and they come to their
website, they're going to see the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you know you have traffic on
your website and you just put the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources there that is easy for people to
see, then it's a really good way to like
[SPEAKER_00]: get the information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, another thing is, again,
we are similarly like engagement focused
[SPEAKER_00]: or like, for example, the siting and
planning grant that we're on for like
[SPEAKER_00]: local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a part of the grant, we have to have
regular like community meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't call them that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like town halls with local like residents
and government institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our team members have been like
traveling all over North and South
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina to come to these communities and
be like, hey, this is what this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not on that grant, so I can't
tell you like what their marketing scheme
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm assuming it's a lot of,
you know, working with, you have to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with the local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also it's really important to make
sure to get this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, a lot of this stuff happens
at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about workforce development?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on helping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping connect the dots on on renewable
or climate worthy workforce development.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some thoughts on on how you can
help activate that in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have our training team that
does a lot of that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, the center itself works a
lot with the local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we have good relationships with
the North Carolina Utilities Commission
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Department of Environmental
Quality and the state energy office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the state energy office is the group
running their solar for all grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a sub awardee under them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just talking in this particular
case, like Desire is national,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Desire platform is national or database,
forgive me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you say the workforce,
does North Carolina invite folks to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to North Carolina to work on workforce
development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you provide consulting for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know our training team does do like
fee for service work related to training
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, just because you really need
that physical experience, it has to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of time with local like local
governments or local companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know it's possible to like do
things like remotely through through Zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: or even have people come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember we had I think they came
in from as a part of one of the grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a group come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A university in the Navajo Nation came to
Raleigh to take one of our training
[SPEAKER_00]: forces, but that that part's really going
to vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have to be honest, I'm not an
expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our training teams practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's something you want to talk
about in another webinar, I can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruby, what about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about workforce development?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned it in your platform,
but how how can we help local communities
[SPEAKER_02]: build out workforce development
opportunities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that is not currently an area
that's on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is we do have like a whole long running
list of topics and policies to explore in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just say I do think I think there's
a lot of energy around workforce
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen states create like state level
climate workforce development programs
[SPEAKER_01]: like Climate Corp at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of states are looking into like the
EV transition, just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other other areas where.
[SPEAKER_01]: States, especially with a lot of federal
funding, are seeing booms in these
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies and these sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would just say like states,
states providing support, identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: needs and gaps in their workforces,
providing grants for training or
[SPEAKER_01]: retraining or educational programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that can help push it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a perspective from the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another question for you Ruby of all
the policies that you've had to look
[SPEAKER_02]: across.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cause you are sort of this really
unique individual who has been tethered to
[SPEAKER_02]: this platform, but also tethered to all
the policies that are embedded.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is one of your favorite policies that
you have seen that just gives you hope and
[SPEAKER_02]: happiness?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing how states are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to incorporate a lot more
environmental justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Positions and policies into their like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate policy framework almost like the
last five, six years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a lot of states create EJ
positions, EJ offices, update or define
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental justice communities,
develop tools to identify them,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think the federal justice 40
initiative also played a big role in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's really up to states and local
communities to continue pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental justice and making sure that
that's a mainstream movement and concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, that was a perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise I did not ask her that question
knowingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to close out today's event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining on March
19th at 2 PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a solar and environmental
justice webinars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to learn about different
strategies on that topic, be sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: register and hopefully the link is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the link is not in there and I will put
the link in there right now, the
[SPEAKER_02]: registration link, I want to thank Ruby
and Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for your leadership and
your enthusiasm and your hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, it's really wonderful and
timely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for sharing your time with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
