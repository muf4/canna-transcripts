[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Louis, for that kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me many decades to get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to come to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time when we were touring the colleges
and universities in 2019 for my son,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were scheduled to come to Cornell and
we were stuck in Newark Airport for 36
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we came close, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to be here physically,
although I see familiar faces here and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: glad I'm on the campus and good to see you
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming this afternoon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room is quite full, so that's nice
always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still see people keep coming into the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be the food, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good sign when people are
coming in this direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have given a lot of talks and there have
been times when people are getting up and
[SPEAKER_01]: going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in one talk like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting up front and the person who
was giving the talk and people were
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving and leaving and leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I happened to be the last person
sitting up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, Duane, no, the person who was
speaking said, Raj, are you really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in what I had to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the next speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk about precision
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been my bread and butter,
my career for the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of work has happened with graduate
students like Louis Longchamps,
[SPEAKER_01]: who spent seven plus years in my lab,
first as grad student, then as a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been a really interesting
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of looking back and
then bringing you up to speed where things
[SPEAKER_01]: are today and what we're doing in
precision ag in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me start with a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to start with a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this picture?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each one of you use it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are saying it's a computer and
has wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be a mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be a mobile computer then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first GPS unit that was
developed by Rockwell Collins in 1976.
[SPEAKER_01]: Louis mentioned I served two terms on NASA
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw this picture first time,
it was very intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a matter of less than 20 years,
it went from a size of this GPS unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will fit only maybe half a dozen in
this room, to something that you can hold
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the tip of your finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the chip that's in every cell
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a cell phone that you bought
after year 2000, you have that chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of hard to imagine how
agriculture or society or technology will
[SPEAKER_01]: change in the next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that happened, it surprised even
scientists at NASA, how dramatically we
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hold it on the tip of your finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in every cell phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the initial mobile unit that was
given for military purposes, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how many of you have Googled this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is me in late 90s mapping
nitrogen stress in corn fields in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before Kansas State, I was in Colorado
State for 20 some years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I had my entire faculty career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing a Velcro tape here with a data
logger, which is connected through
[SPEAKER_01]: ARTIS-232 port to Minolta spad meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a two kilo monochromatic Fujitsu
pen tablet with a revolving hard disk,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a solid state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I'm carrying a bunch of
deep cycle batteries to power the Trimble
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you walk, it got heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how we were mapping nitrogen
stress at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the common theme you
will see in my talk today, ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify variability in crop and soil
parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my entire career has been
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then creating decisions to make those
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I now take you to 1983.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened in 83?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: GPS became accessible for civilian
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you took my Precision Act
course, I taught three courses at Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first laboratories we will do
is take multiple different GPS units that
[SPEAKER_01]: work on different frequencies,
go to a benchmark, and we'll do an error
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do the northing and the easting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you calculate the circular error
probable, meaning where does the 50% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the data reside in the XY domain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, back then, you're lucky
if you're within the 50 meters plus minus
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pulled a paper from IEEE.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, the horizontal
positioning for standard signal,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is SPS, used to be 100 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what military had without correction,
which is precise positioning system,
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be 20 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have come a long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the publications that
were coming out during those days,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're focused on, hey, we got access to
GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how we can improve the
signaling and make it more precise and
[SPEAKER_01]: differential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you guys can read the
authors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to draw your attention to one
individual, Brad Parkinson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad Parkinson is the father of GPS,
global positioning systems, a professor in
[SPEAKER_01]: Stanford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where him and his colleagues,
four of them, they are the brains behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, just before COVID, Queen
Elizabeth awarded them with a million
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds award for being instrumental in
engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: All four were done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to know Dr. Parkinson quite
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was privileged to be, he's the co-chair,
still today, he's the co-chair of NASA
[SPEAKER_01]: board, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Residential Advisory Board on Positioning,
Navigation, and Training.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our meetings in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of you may know Dr. James
Schlesinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first secretary of energy and
then he had multiple other assignments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I look a little bit younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still young, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to draw your attention to the
person who's sitting right next to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: late Dr. Ronald Hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, decimeter accuracy in tractor
systems or combine systems are so common.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the brains behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was the brains behind the star fire
that John Deere inherited and be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide decimeter accuracy without any
correctional signals because they got
[SPEAKER_01]: access to not the encrypted data,
but the frequency on dual frequencies on
[SPEAKER_01]: GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of contribution there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the literature was focused more
on, hey, how could we improve accuracy of
[SPEAKER_01]: GPS in those days, there was this
individual whose wheels were turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, hey, we now have access to this is
Dr. late Dr. Pierre Robert, who was
[SPEAKER_01]: designated as the father of precision
agriculture, a Belgian scientist
[SPEAKER_01]: established the first Precision Act Center
in University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good friend and colleague, he passed away
untimely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was thinking as a visionary as he was
that how one day location based
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture may become a reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after one of these tri-society
meeting, ASA, CSSA, and SSA, these
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues are sitting in a bar in Chicago
with their beer in their hand and they
[SPEAKER_01]: start scribbling on a piece of napkin
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reconstructed it by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the real napkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hold that with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one day that we will embracing GPS as
a mundane affair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so IPNI, which is no longer their
International Plant Nutrition Institute
[SPEAKER_01]: closed down after 75 years, took this to
their designers and this was put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was at one point of time and
Harold may remember that this was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most widely used infogram or what
precision agriculture may become one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in I think in 84 or 85,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that the founders of
Precision Act cautioned us that once we
[SPEAKER_01]: are engaged in location based agriculture,
that will give rise to lots and lots and
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll be talking a lot about
engagement with data and data analytics as
[SPEAKER_01]: we continue to solve the challenge of
spatial temporal management looking into
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Variability happens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was flying in yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a tremendous amount of variability
in landscape and topography and soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: soil type, crop cover, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture taken from an airplane
looking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anywhere in Colorado,
Western Kansas, parts of Nebraska and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fields are not alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is landscape scale variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can zoom in on it on a farm that may
have 2030 pivots and other rain fed
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and they still don't look
alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a farm scale variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can zoom in on one field where we have
done some work and you still see
[SPEAKER_01]: variability in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that inherent variability is what we
have been trying in my lab along with
[SPEAKER_01]: several others where after quantifying
without having to actually acquire a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil samples, how could we do it in an
economically affordable manner,
[SPEAKER_01]: less labor intensive manner?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the remote sensing came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has an implication because
oftentimes not all this, but oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: this inherent variability, I'm going to
click next and show you the crops growing
[SPEAKER_01]: on these fields translates into that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the entire field is treated
uniformly, that inherent variability,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I were to go here, it translates into
the crop production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're putting 150 pounds of
nitrogen across the entire field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not in your corn,
not across the entire field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the whole point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a holy grail of precision
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make tailor management systems
to feed the entire field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been 30 years since our
capability to quantify grain yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so pixel by pixel combine is
moving on the motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick, we can pick, but
unfortunately, even today, how are farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: managing their fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to, I, you know,
our lab did this quick analysis many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's your combine and he's just a
schematic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's moving and is harvesting depending
on the size of the header, six row,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 row, whatever number of rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every second is dropping a pixel
quantifying how much grain yield is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stitch the whole thing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a digital yield map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quantifying how much you're harvesting
from each and every part of the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through the cleaning process
because there are errors associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have cleaned the data,
if you were to run quick statistics,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll give you the, you know, frequency
distribution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this particular example,
average is 180 bushel to an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This example is more than 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's simple query that you can write
in any of the platforms that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how many pixels match the average?
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd louder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less than 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other guesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some pessimists in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mathematical average that doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this example, 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one of my colleagues at the
keynote in InfoAg many years back and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, well, if you are chasing average,
you're missing the target 100% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 98% of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, and when we showed this data
exactly like what you said, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to satisfy farmer's curiosity,
we said, okay, how about we go plus and
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 1% of the mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be more realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think happens now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 10, 12% depends on the field and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, to further illustrate our point,
we went plus minus 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're talking about 10 bushels on
each side is still what happens is 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you're chasing average,
it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was the last time that you had normal
weather?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with that plus minus 10% bushel on
each side, even if you were to call that
[SPEAKER_01]: large window as average, 20% of the field,
1% of the field, you over fertilized in
[SPEAKER_01]: this example, and 35% of the field,
you did not apply enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an oversimplistic version.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's soil fertility, soil scientists,
including myself in the room, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just an example to give you a
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are chasing average, you're
missing the target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this has been the key mantra for
Precision Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we manage variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can only manage what you can
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the key question is how do you measure
variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you measure it, then how do you
manage variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that has been a lot of work in my
lab along with several other around the
[SPEAKER_01]: nation and the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the fields that we did a
lot of grid soil sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went out with a coarser grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work was done in 97, 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of dating myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This led to development of a lot of signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on one field, those three years,
we went out and did a coarser sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in one part of the field,
we said, well, let's do a finer grade
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went out and sampled very
intensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmer was saying, you're taking
all the top soil away to your lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did so much sampling there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like any precision practitioner,
you first want to estimate the spatial
[SPEAKER_01]: range or the distance at which there is
correlation versus no correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that for this sampling,
the spatial range happens to be 15 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will require 2,500 soil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: To accurately capture, this is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our work is with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: To accurately capture distribution of
nitrogen in the surface soil, that will
[SPEAKER_01]: require 2,500 soil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how many of you students will sign up
for that, let alone farmers or
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's untenable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nugget effect is so bad that for
all the sampling we did here, amounted to
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot interpolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are a lot of softwares out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You click, click, click, will create the
surface that has no technical merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a book that our good
colleague and friend, Margaret Oliver and
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruth Carey edited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a chapter in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the very opening chapter,
Margaret says, well, for you to do
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate prediction, you not only have to
measure variability, at the spatial range,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to do that at half the spatial
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an exponential function.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pull out your calculator,
it's a 55 hectare field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're talking about seven meter by
seven meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many soil samples now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exponential function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10,000 soil samples for you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we learned it really quickly that,
look, it's labor intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intensive, time consuming,
and not economically affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need an alternate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need an alternate that can accurately
quantify variability without those
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, throughout my journey in my
precision ag world, we want something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grit soil sampling is diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And time consuming, labor intensive,
cost prohibitive, and must be deployed at
[SPEAKER_01]: spatially dependent scales if you want to
have meaningful outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it became very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what led to us writing
the proposal in 1999 that was funded
[SPEAKER_01]: partly by NASA and USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be an initiative called
IFAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my lab was one of them that got that
funding for a million dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: which used to be a lot at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so four of my PhD students worked on
developing four different techniques of
[SPEAKER_01]: management zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they worked on looking at so many
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we capture variability,
employing remote sensing, bare soil
[SPEAKER_01]: imagery, topography, farmers experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, we didn't have access to 10
years of yield map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this became a commercial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company called Centennial Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first one that embraced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then iterations of this was picked up
everywhere in the Union and north of the
[SPEAKER_01]: border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada uses it in so many other places as
our work has taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we needed data collection at high
spatial densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been our question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we address that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a quarter of a quarter section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a quarter section is 160 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a quarter of a quarter section
that was furrowing and devastated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some money from my endowment and I
said, I'm going to put in a precision
[SPEAKER_01]: pivot systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of our site where we
continue to do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the system that we built here is a
precision irrigation system, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first ones at that time in the
country that has drop nozzles five feet
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can change the rate of application
of water at every nozzle level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mathematically speaking, you have 5,000
plus management pixels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the drop nozzle that you can
change the rate of application at every
[SPEAKER_01]: nozzle level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actuate that at every two
degrees of pivot movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the quick math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's 5,400 mathematical water
management zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I've said in my papers
as well, the technology is ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the technology I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my decision map?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still working on this today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my decision map?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it even make sense to be applying
differential rates of water just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: have technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are so many unknowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it even make sense to apply
differential rate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we figure out how much water could
be applied in each zone or in each pixel?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many zones are ideal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do these zones change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they change every season or every year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you actuate your pivot or
lateral?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often does that change?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it change and how often?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I measure if I have the tool to
manage?
[SPEAKER_01]: My management pixel is five feet by five
feet, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quadrilateral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a square.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do I measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that quest, before it was only for
nitrogen, then we started to be dabbling
[SPEAKER_01]: with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water and nitrogen go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always worked in irrigated systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we said, how do we measure that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll go back to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go out, send your students out to
measure with TDR soil moisture on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calculate that this is their spatial
dependence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that, this field,
this is a 22 acre pivot, needed 84 sensing
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote a proposal to John Deere.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Deere was in used to be in water
systems at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see I said I need 100 sensing nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my system, they said, you guys are
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, well, we know it, but we still
need to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because I need to be able to quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is wireless sensor node.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Deere gave us about 10 or 12 such
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We later have partnership with Harkow and
they gave us some more systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't do this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine 10 foot tall pole in these
many locations in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer is going to love you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each sensor node is about $3,000 to
$5,000 in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this work on one half of the field.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bless his heart, Dong Wei.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a visiting scholar, postdoc in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was looking for a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went out with access tubes to
measure soil moisture every week,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes twice a week to quantify how
much was in the profile at five depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Louie led this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We established spatial and temporal
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some key messaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was so good for the irrigation
company that there has to be dynamic water
[SPEAKER_01]: management zone each time you actuate your
pivot.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the zone could change because
pivot may take two and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: three or five days to go around the entire
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the challenge was, how do we measure
soil moisture in situ non destructively at
[SPEAKER_01]: spatial dependent scales?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why just water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not other parameters as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, five years back,
John Deere came out with this spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: CN spray that you can actuate any nozzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, again, your management is like two
feet by two feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many sensors would it take to
measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking diagnostic measurement,
not surrogate measure like remote sensing
[SPEAKER_01]: or sensor based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this challenge has been something
that we have been trying to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want high spatial density, diagnostic,
rapid and expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that became part of the chapter
that I co-authored at the National Academy
[SPEAKER_01]: of Sciences Science Breakthroughs 2030
report.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was presented to Congress in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, OK, could we try that with
sensors?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you some of the work
that we did while he was in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, how about we go to the sensor
route?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, look at inexpensive sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's diagnostic, high spatial density and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a company out of France
reached out to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This used to be a forty thousand dollar
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, well, we'll present it to you
for, you know, for for nitrogen purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, they were only selling this
to vineyards to measure the phenolic
[SPEAKER_01]: component of the grapes for high quality
wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, OK, let's give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came up with the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we measure optical properties
using fluorescence in soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, does it even make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did some literature review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, there was literature to
back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a multiplex fluorescence sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four induction channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultraviolet and RGB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are three detection channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your output is 12 different parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you can create your own
ratios to come up even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actuated at 400 hertz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in every second of your work,
it generates a lot of data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use it for one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just boatloads of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the longer you work with it,
it's just you're collecting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data and more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he went out to the field,
came up with a randomized sampling design.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Louis working with the prototype
newer version, lot lighter, newer version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very good at fixing things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked the entire field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a closer shot of how he was
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he walked everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was collecting for several seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we did, we took soil samples
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he took it out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we dried it, created a uniform
pattern, and then had our student help us
[SPEAKER_01]: out with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this work for three years,
over nine sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Tani.
[SPEAKER_01]: After drying it, she's working in the lab,
ready to shine or fluoresce the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: take measurements there in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are our samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visually speaking, I can't see a whole lot
of difference other than color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this data sat with us for a long time
because it was hard to figure out what can
[SPEAKER_01]: we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently hired a postdoc who has
machine learning and artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence competencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was looking at the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to draw an analogy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we deploy machine learning
in the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a big extension appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to break it down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, OK, how do Google or these
cameras work?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're training the cameras all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking so many pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to pick up one of the global
celebrities.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Bill Gates?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody can recognize Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's Mr. Gates with the same glasses
and similar looking sweater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you tell the computer, hey,
that's Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, he changes his orientation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sweater changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell the computer, hey, this is also
Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he may lose the sweater.
[SPEAKER_01]: He may look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're trying to do, we're trying
to train the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the fallacies we have
that we need lots and lots of data to
[SPEAKER_01]: first train the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't exist in agriculture
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many iterations do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I have for the pivot for me to
train the machine so that it can go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the predictability?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: He loses the sweater.
[SPEAKER_01]: His orientation changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're mixing it with different ages
of Mr. Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the computer still recognize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Google makes lots of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets more and more complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pattern behind changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loses the sweater as well as the
jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it recognize?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if he gets very younger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it still accurately identify?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do enough learning,
can it now predict how it's going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: next?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what we're trying to
chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if I train the pivot and the sensors
enough so that the sensor can look the
[SPEAKER_01]: information ahead of the pivot,
feed that information on the edge
[SPEAKER_01]: computer, and send the decision back to
the pivot so I can apply the right amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of water at the right place at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our USD goal by 2050 is to cut down our
water footprint by 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Kansas sitting on Ogallala.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year alone, it depleted two feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The report came out last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depleted two feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to stay there forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year was a very dry year.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no substitute for human
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Steve Jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out Mr. Gates used to look like
him too back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens if I look at the
comparison, it requires a lot of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is only the visual element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is only visual element.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to make it very easy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two are very different looking
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will the machine perform what we're
training it to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And about soil, soils are simple.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mighty challenging trying to train
the signals coming from soil, not just
[SPEAKER_01]: physical property, but also chemical
property to see, OK, what can we learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from those iterations?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: He averaged it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Dipankar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He averaged the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you have that many predictions,
so 12 channels plus some more modified
[SPEAKER_01]: indices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you are basically running mapping
in multi-dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start looking at what are
significant relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked up three or four of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on that, he parceled 70% of the data
to train the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he used 30% of the data to test
the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So training, R is 0.91.
[SPEAKER_01]: R is 0.57.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we realized that the
fields where we were doing sampling had
[SPEAKER_01]: very low nitrogen parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did a better job with low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the model really stinks as you get
into higher parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's based on what we are
training the model to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do next?
[SPEAKER_01]: If one day we're successful, and there are
many laboratories that are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: resolve this challenge, OK, if we're
successful, we can have an unknown soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sample, use some kind of technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not endorsing any.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do go through the optimum
feature selection, have a trained model,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the regression.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a soil estimate, and you go to
the end recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to caution you, it requires huge
amount of data for the training purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your results is only going to be as good
as what you can train it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can collect data in high spatial
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be 40 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's now down to 19,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more such, and there have been
improvements in version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diagnostic, no, this is also a surrogate
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rapid, a person has to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can mount it on a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this unit right now feels miserably in
motion.
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a person has to walk over there,
actuate fluorescence, and then move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inexpensive, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data processing and analysis requires a
high amount of skill labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been our quest, that how do we
get spatial high density rapid and
[SPEAKER_01]: inexpensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is, again, Louis and Rafael
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our best technology that's affordable is
out there, make a soil solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: and do a nitrate nitrate test check.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more qualitative than quantitative,
or there's a LACWA meter that gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, talking with engineers, they say,
hey, we can measure this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have a reference electrode and
a working electrode, and you have got a
[SPEAKER_01]: power circuit and reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can identify a working electrode
that can measure nitrates and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, you dip it, and you test it out
against different molar solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the response to voltage is fairly
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you change the molarity of the
sodium nitrate, it gives you a stair step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an aha moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we translate that into a very
inexpensive nitrate sensor that can
[SPEAKER_01]: measure nitrogen distribution in soils at
high spatial densities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Diagnostic, rapid, inexpensive,
destructive, involves labor, time
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming if you have to go out and do it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I was referring to
the science breakthroughs report that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was part of at National Academies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read the chapter, it mentions
that this ought to happen if we want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next level of precision management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it out right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us to become competitive in the
proposal world, we added three more things
[SPEAKER_01]: when we wrote this proposal to ARPA-E.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said our sensor will be battery less,
it will be passive, and we'll build it on
[SPEAKER_01]: a biodegradable material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what we were signing up
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the grant, and I was making this
presentation at the Western Governors
[SPEAKER_01]: Forum, annual forum in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was making a point that I need
sensors that I can literally distribute it
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the field that are inexpensive and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ran into an engineer saying,
we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually print the sensors for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing this in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, OK, so that became the holy
grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then last four years, we have been working
my lab with UC Boulder material
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, UC Berkeley computer
engineering and computer scientists to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop biodegradable printed sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you literally print it on a screen
print.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have a reference electrode,
you have insulating layer, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how, once you have the screen
made, that's how you print it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: conductive ink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave this very detailed presentation at
the last American Society Agronomy
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can literally print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have the electrodes that
you matches up, you can dip it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution to start measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first prototype is eight of these
sensors are in the greenhouse testing
[SPEAKER_01]: going on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been developing nitrate as well as
soil moisture sensor that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: printed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is version zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we are using a circuit
board because we are far away from
[SPEAKER_01]: degradable sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are successful, our idea is that
we'll have a degradable material that will
[SPEAKER_01]: print the circuit and the electrode
directly on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conceptually, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It proves OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sensor works fine for two or three
days in lab conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it fails miserably.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been lasting right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are beyond two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrate is really finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has some of those properties
reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drifts inexpensive, battery less
passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we are decoupling the biodegradable
element.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can just get a nitrate sensor that
works that inexpensive, you can print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that will be a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And accuracy and precision are,
again, there are so many hoops that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to jump that we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through a lot of material testing
where we did accelerated degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put in harsh environment,
put it on the shaker for 24 hours that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what the sensors will
experience in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if the plow goes right
through or the bore detail goes right
[SPEAKER_01]: through?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens to the sensor?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also continuously are doing fuel
studies in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: With different materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use different soil types,
sand versus peat versus clay, the
[SPEAKER_01]: performance and the drifting of the sensor
happens big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of hoops to be jumped,
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we keep taking destructive
samples to see at different time frames
[SPEAKER_01]: that how the sensors or the sensor
materials are behaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't behave so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we do want these sensors to fail at
some point of time, but our time target is
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you distribute these sensors out in the
field, you don't have to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: collect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they break down and they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell we won't get rich selling
these sensors because our target price is
[SPEAKER_01]: a few pennies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just print them, print them,
print them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the money is not in the sensor,
the money is in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the farmer won't invest,
I could imagine practitioners go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: embed the field with sensor technology,
and then you're collecting data in X and
[SPEAKER_01]: Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ZDEV and TimeT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're working with multi-dimensional
data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll require a lot of machine learning
and AI algorithms for us to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision map.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been publishing all along in some
good journals what we are learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of dummy sensor field testing
with different, because it has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulated so that the sensor don't
degrade before we want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of grunt work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of successes, tremendous amount of
failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you right now, this is not
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how the same sensor behaves in
different soil types, we're very cognizant
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not close to where we could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture sensor from our learning,
we're a little bit closer than we are for
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrate sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start with the biodegradable material,
you etch it with a stencil, then you fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it with the conductive, and you etch the
conductive ink again so that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: conduct whatever signal we're trying to
do, and it becomes conductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we add a couple of wires
so that now we can communicate with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you encapsulate that with a wax
coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the video still works, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my co-PIs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the balsa wood substrate that we
print on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put a stencil on top in the shape of
the electrode pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we use just a blade to coat
through this stencil pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ink is right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use an ink like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a zinc ink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do that, we get an electrode
pattern that prints on the balsa wood that
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like that, made of the zinc.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not conductive, so we have to
make it conductive until we dip it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution of acetic acid, which etches the
zinc oxide layer and makes it conductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we attach wires.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to communicate with it,
to interact with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use an epoxy to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We connect the wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use this mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we use a mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the mold, we then coat the wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the trick in this is coating the
wax and making sure there's no cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's a very good wax coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is basically a complete sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go closer, I will see the
communication wires.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the wires, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can connect these, obviously,
to electronics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, ultimately, in the future,
we'll just connect them to a RFID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first prototype may look something
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's missing the board right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's missing the electronics board,
which will go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be an electronics board here,
which will be Wi-Fi communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two wires will connect to that
board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this will go in the soil,
up to about there, to make a measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be what our first measurement
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can program it such that it can
record at any frequency we choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, within reason, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have any battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a radio frequency wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sensor is sleeping all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wake it up for a millisecond.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the work, soil solution around it,
measures it, sends the signal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we record it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as many times as we actuate it,
it provides the memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a balsa wood substrate that we
print off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vice president of research office did
a cover story on the work that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they took this picture,
but it's a pretty good-looking picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a starting point for sensor
node setup that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always measure it with commercial
sensor to see how well the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor is performing against our sensor
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always grow a plant on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do these kind of things,
commercial vendors reach out to you and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, we have figured this out,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to test, do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we created a test bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company out of Finland that
reached out to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, they have been following our
work for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, we will give you
those sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are battery-powered sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very small, but the battery will
last 20 years because the sensor is
[SPEAKER_01]: sleeping all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's non-degradable and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did create a test bed at the North
Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go through a bunch of hoops in
order for them to be pinged and data to be
[SPEAKER_01]: read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the base station, solar-powered
Wi-Fi module.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these rows are where we have 24 sensors
in a field size of this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our test bed that we did last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actuated from our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can program it for frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my postdoc wrote an app that you
can immediately create a surface map or a
[SPEAKER_01]: heat map, as he calls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a two-dimensional heat map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did this at two depths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as many times as you actuate data in x,
y, and z, you can have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only for the surface for multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with depth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What weight should I give to 6 inches
depth versus 24 inches depth versus 36
[SPEAKER_01]: inches depth?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of unknowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work that we have been doing for the
last 10, 15 years, we go out and measure
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what my lab has been doing is,
till we don't have the sensors,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't need to wait to work with spatial
temporal data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any given year, we collect 30-some
data layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just stacking it up right here to
create that big data set and train it
[SPEAKER_01]: through machine learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Employ some of the AI algorithms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are self-explanatory, what kind of
data layers that you can collect,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way down to the yield map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then help translate into a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the relevance is or
weight matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine the weight matrix?
[SPEAKER_01]: That which data layer has more weight in
the decision?
[SPEAKER_01]: And each parameter we're doing farming for
centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have this quantitative
assessment of how it impacts our decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given some keynotes on farming with
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of questions we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of graduate students here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is PhDs written right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what data not to collect,
because it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going out and collecting whatever
we can lay our hands on, or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate student agrees to collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of biometrics or statistical
computing would be needed to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship within and across the spatial
temporal data set?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the weight assign and the role?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we account for seasonal
anomalies?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we ensure this is reproducible and
reliable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, and this is the proposal we
wrote to USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of the proposal is Artificial
Intelligence for Sustainability of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: My role is water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are other groups that are
looking at salinity and pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: and diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a SAS grant that we have in motion
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this list is very long,
what we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have graduate students who are
working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can envision that someday we'll get to a
point that we'll have in situ
[SPEAKER_01]: non-destructive, rapid, reliable
inexpensive sensor network that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data layers, that will be
feeding it along with other data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll employ machine learning and
AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep the complexity to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be automated somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the decision power will still be in
the hand of the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I don't like this decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put 20 pounds more, no matter
what you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put 20 pounds more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, I think, could be part of the
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying this is the only solution,
that by 2050, we can reduce our inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen and water, by 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll welcome any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned that this approach
requires machine learning and artificial
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was noticing in your illustrations,
especially in the first slide,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no human beings in these systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder if you could talk about what
the role of human intelligence and human
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers is in this project, in this
paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question, for those who are online,
the question is that you are talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of ML and AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not see much human intelligence and
human intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot eliminate human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I sure hope that we are not
requiring all those data layers to be
[SPEAKER_01]: captured.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point in time, we'll figure it
out, that I don't need to go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: measure soil moisture distribution at
30-minute frequency, just because weather
[SPEAKER_01]: data is recorded, or 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weather data is recorded that way that I
have to record soil moisture at that
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the element of human
intelligence come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said in the previous slide,
that we're not eliminating farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farmer will have the final
decision-making process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that most likely will be happening on
their smartphone or iPad or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: interface that we'll be working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to overwhelm farmer or,
for that reason, practitioner in the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision-making process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to keep that simple, keep the
complexity to this group right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, think about many of the
technologies that have been successful and
[SPEAKER_01]: have been picked up were intentionally
kept simple, built on a very robust
[SPEAKER_01]: complex systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are never eliminating human
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in our lifetimes, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's an AI, Chad, GPT,
and so many other things out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, how are you going to
integrate this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you already have sensors out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're called plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at what point are you going to be
integrating plant information?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing already the integration for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the link there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question is, how are you integrating
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our group is taking surrogate measures
from crop and plant responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other groups like mine that are
working on in-plant sensors, where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using stickers to stick the sensors to the
leaves, zapping in electrodes to measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the sap content continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several AI institutes that have
been funded through NSF, $20 million
[SPEAKER_01]: grant, that are developing those in-plant
sensors to do exactly what we are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our focus has always been on nitrogen and
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have to move away from
actually putting things in plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: basically using, I won't say from what
sensing, but in a sense, because you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: just keep putting sensors out there
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a combination of things that
will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're just trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And NASA, in 2000, in year 2000,
they had an in-plant sensor, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the NASA Innovation News
report.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tested that, and they were measuring
the turgor pressure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they programmed it to a cell phone
that every time the turgor pressure was
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping, you get a text message,
hey, water me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, there are some simpler
technologies that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just right now it's picking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will involve a lot of frugal
innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're trying to do it at high
spatial densities, even large farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see where the instrumentation
gets tied into plant performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got all this information about
soils or climate and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is that implication for plant
performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want you to carry this
impression there is equal or larger body
[SPEAKER_01]: of work is being done with plant S
sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not cover that today.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the rest of time, we have one last
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent presentation, Dr. Krosla.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see what's your envision
on a big data management and regulation
[SPEAKER_07]: policies.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much data has been going on,
creating.
[SPEAKER_07]: How will it look like, the access to this
big data to the stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_07]: practitioners, public, and the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question has to do with the big data
and the security and the ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: That conversation is happening nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we don't have a resolution on
that or consensus on that at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farmers still owns the data because
there are so many private companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are collecting huge amount of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The raw data is still owned by the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fine print says that the
derivative and my understanding is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the derivative could be used for other
purposes, but not the direct data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just last week, no, this week,
Monday, we visited a farmer who manages
[SPEAKER_01]: 43,000 acres in Colby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has been collecting data for last
20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the rare farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very open to giving the data set if
we can translate that into meaningful
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not found a lot of farmers like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes into a cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a John Deere customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the derivatives are being
derived so that continuous improvement,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's machine performance or labor
working in the field or not, or pivot is
[SPEAKER_01]: clogged or whatever that might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have a solution on the
ownership if that's what you're getting at
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Raj.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another round of applause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
