[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for such a nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to give a talk and talk a
little bit more about both my research and
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenocyte, and hopefully I get to
convince you all to come and use our
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic phenotyping facility more,
because we do have space and we do have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, availability for phenotyping all
of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as you probably are aware,
the world is experiencing crises of all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds, and agriculture in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the crisis that we can
actually know something about and do
[SPEAKER_00]: something about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see all kinds of crises,
including pollution, deforestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know too much about soil,
which is weird for a root biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do know quite a lot about is
water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got, and the blue dots are
representing regions that are affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got either too much water,
too little water, or the wrong kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and that's the case in soil stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we can do about it as plant
biologists with our talents, our skills,
[SPEAKER_00]: our knowledge, we can diversify the
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't be fooled by my Photoshop
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a desert rose that is native to an
island off the coast of Yemen in Socotra,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is here, very desert-like
environment, and we can learn about,
[SPEAKER_00]: from those extreme, extreme plants,
how are they dealing with those extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and maybe include that in our
species that we like to eat, like
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can look at the species that are
very closely related to the species that
[SPEAKER_00]: we already like to eat and look at the
intraspecific variation, so within the
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the approach that my lab
has been taking to really look at the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives to crops that we like to eat and
learn from them, because those species
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been pampered in the greenhouse
haven't been pampered by the breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they really had to fend for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, as Jan already mentioned,
so we're working on quite a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis is still a workhorse in the
lab because it's just an easy plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and validate some of our things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working on the wild tomato,
which is a very close relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated tomatoes, Solanum
pimpinellifolium, so that's this guy over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have been working on peppery
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppery bean is a close relative to common
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fasciolus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's native to southwest of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and northern Mexico, so another very dry
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been used by native communities
for centuries right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got natural diversity panel
established for that, that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really going to talk too much
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other species that we're also
investigating is kaupi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kaupi is native to sub-Saharan Africa,
where it has been a great resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: many subsistence farmers that don't have
access to irrigation, don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of fertilization, and it's really
thriving there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really cool thing about comparing
those two species together, peppery bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fasciolus aquitifolius.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know any Latin, like not me,
you can say, okay, so aquitifolius is
[SPEAKER_00]: really because the needle-like leaf,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, peppery bean, it has those very very
narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no wonder you're drought tolerant
because you have hardly any leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaupi, on the other hand, has leaves as
big as my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's really interesting that both of
those species have drought tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but probably the mechanism or their
strategy of dealing with drought stress is
[SPEAKER_00]: very very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the beginning, when I was starting
a lab, I'm like, okay, I'm going to screen
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those species for drought tolerance
and see which genes are common between
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like, I cannot do that because
it's a stupid idea, because all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: different populations are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kaupi, we're really screening a
population of domesticated species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppery bean, we've got a mix of
domesticated and wild accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solanum pimpinellifolium, as far as I'm
aware, except maybe for Joyce von Eck,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody has domesticated pimpinellifolium
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're really dealing with a variety of
different populations and their nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, we're not going to find the
same genetic signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already hard to find, to reproduce
GWAS between two different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let alone between the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, in the end, I'm like, well,
it might be not the best idea to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: commonalities of drought stress
resistance, but diversity, and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot word in the recent climate,
but diversity of mechanisms and strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: of dealing with drought stress might be
actually even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I have my own ways of dealing
with stress before the presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe Jim will have a different
strategy of dealing with stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're exchanging those strategies
between each other, maybe we can get even
[SPEAKER_00]: more relaxed and even more chilled,
because I know that Jim is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, similarly, with drought stress,
maybe by combining different strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibited by different plants,
we can actually get super drought tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, or breed plants for different
drought scenarios, because drought in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca is very different compared to
drought in Arizona, or drought in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before I go into more detail,
I'm really going to focus a little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: the discovery pipeline that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're really looking at the,
starting with the trait identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you have a whole phenotype of a plant,
and you can study all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you look at the plant,
the more things that you can measure you
[SPEAKER_00]: can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick is, for us, is that that
specific trait needs to have some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability because we are using forward
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no heritability to it,
maybe genetics is not the best way of
[SPEAKER_00]: studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe biochemistry or transcriptomics is
the best way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, we're really relying on
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking at heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that a lot of geneticists
are not a big fan of is we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: how that trait is plastic in response to
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of the research that has been
done on, that has been already done on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics of stress resilience has been
done on, you know, genes that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that are not necessarily changing
throughout the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a very good reason for that
because you want your corn to be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: very well in the field in Ithaca,
as well as it's growing in the field in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, as well as in Pennsylvania and
everywhere else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want something that has really,
really high heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're missing on the things that the
plant is incredibly plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if you grow plants in
different day lengths, they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop different number of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf size might change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of flat roots is changing
constantly depending on the water
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're really interested in like,
okay, what are the traits that are showing
[SPEAKER_00]: some plasticity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a part of like an experience of
working with GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to have as atomic value of
a trait as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're working with the
fiends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fiend to phenotype is the same as gene
to genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fiend is like a dissected component of
your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about like, okay,
well, if I study drought stress tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just study survival, survival is
extremely complex trait because it depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on how deep are your roots grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your water use efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is your shoot to root ratio?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your growth rate maintenance?
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff, are you slowing down as
soon as you're like thinking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I've got, I'm experiencing drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to stop for a second and think and
adjust and then keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I just like insensitive to drought
and keep on growing and then I grow myself
[SPEAKER_00]: to death really?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're trying to dissect the phenotype
into as many molecule or like as many
[SPEAKER_00]: components that are as easy as possible to
describe with a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully by doing that, we're
increasing the heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you think about like the survival,
the heritability of survival, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But heritability of growth in one week
after germination, well, that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth rate is already a
complicated trait and you can divide it
[SPEAKER_00]: even further, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, okay, I spend a lot of time on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got a lot of the trait
identified of interest, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a population screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing phenotyping and for genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only once we are at the level of
gene of interest, we're doing a study,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're validating it using reverse
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're identifying what is the molecular
context because some of the genes might
[SPEAKER_00]: not be conserved in all of the species but
the molecular context in which they are
[SPEAKER_00]: acting might be easily translatable across
different varieties of species that we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also at this level, we're really going
to look at like what is the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between my trait of interest caused by
that one gene and the overall plant
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking at the correlations or
relationship at the level of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity panel because those plants that
are different in number of flat roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: number of branches, they are also very
different in their root physiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology and pollen development and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I'm harvesting all of the diversity
that is really related to the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, why should I be ignoring all
of the diversity that is happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive development, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I should be cognizant about that and
looking at the relationship between that
[SPEAKER_00]: and the natural diversity panel might not
be the best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got maybe a bi-parental
population, that's a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as Jan told you, I already started my
kind of research in stress-induced changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant architecture really looking at
Arabidopsis because that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-domesticated species in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we were asking like,
okay, so when I grow my plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing concentration of salt stress,
my plants are growing smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are they growing different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just smaller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and how are we going to tell if it's
just slower and smaller or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: different?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we have done is we really
dissected the root system architecture in
[SPEAKER_00]: three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got a speed at which your main
root is growing, a speed at which the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral roots are popping up, and the
speed at which the lateral roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now we're using the same functions for
all of the three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of my functions are decreasing by
50% under stress, it means the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture is not changed, it's just
really slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if one of my functions is decreased by
20% and the other one is decreased by 80%,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, ah, okay, the stress is really
actively reprogramming my plant
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, my root system architecture,
because the plant is actively choosing to
[SPEAKER_00]: put more biomass in their lateral roots
compared to the main root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those models were the basis of the
whole screen of natural diversity panel
[SPEAKER_00]: back then that we had in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the natural diversity panel of
Arabidopsis is extended beyond very
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurocentric populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have collected some accessions from
Africa, Saudi Arabia as well, and greater
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also, we have developed this
screen to look, because root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, we're a very proud bunch of
people because we're working on the hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: half, but it's still a half of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I was doing my postdoc in Kaust,
Mark asked me like, well, what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: the root to shoot ratio under salt stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we developed this little tool that
you can quantify the shoot size and the
[SPEAKER_00]: root size from your agar plate images,
and we realized that, okay, the roots to
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot ratio, unlike on the drought stress,
under salt, it just gets dysregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identify a gene that is causal for
that, and that paper just got published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yay, and Mariam, a postdoc in my lab,
really made the final strides in that
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I really want to focus on
pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, pimpinellifolium is a wild tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you can see a plant of
pimpinellifolium growing in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping facility in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are working with approximately 220
accessions of pimpinellifolium that were
[SPEAKER_00]: collected around the west coast of South
America and some of the Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an important source of genetic
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their native range is really varying
because you've got regions that are called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lomas, which are those fog deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there is hardly any rain, and really,
only the fog is coming in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, some of those accessions were
collected around the riverbeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, it's not exactly like
limited in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we thought, okay, there is a really
great variety of environments that those
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions were collected with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have already screened them back in
Kaust in the field for control and salt
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, and in the Plant Accelerator in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that work has also been published last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, me being me, I'm like, let's have a
look at the root system architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did that before I left Saudi
Arabia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're germinating the plants under
control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transfer them for control and salt
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, we scan the plates every single
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, what we're doing is not
necessarily high throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it high-dedication
phenotyping because there is, until now,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was not really a way of automating
it fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single person that has been
working with half-automated pipelines also
[SPEAKER_00]: can appreciate how much work half-manual
work is because you can still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to still, like, draw all of those
roots and make sure that every single time
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are crossing to manually
correct, like, which root is what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have done that together with Hailey
Sussman, who was a technician in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have screened the entire diversity
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Mariam, we really looked at the
diversity panel in a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, okay, are there any plants
that are showing exactly the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: response to stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have identified two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got M248, which is
pimpinellifolium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, well, how about we also
look at some of the cultivated lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we looked at the LA1511.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in here, they're
showing both of them are grown on salt
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're showing exactly the opposite
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one of them is really investing in
producing new lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those lateral roots, they are not
really, like, very good at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, on the other hand,
is really very good in investing in
[SPEAKER_00]: elongating the existing lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are not many new lateral roots
showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we thought, okay, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can do some transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But which time points?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for that purpose, we grew our plants
on this device that is called Spiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's entirely, well, it's 3D printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has some aluminum profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can image, we can take the pictures
of the plants growing on the agar plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Mariam or me don't have to sit in the
lab and scan those plates every hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, as you can imagine, quite
laborious and boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so, we collected all of those
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now we've got a time series that is
incredibly dense for both of our lines
[SPEAKER_00]: under control conditions and salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, salt stress is red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that one of our lines is
indeed, so, in here, we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral root length, individual length of
lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that one of them is really
suffering in their lateral root
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is like, salt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's salt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same happens if you calculate the root
growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's basically derived from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the root growth rate,
again, for one of them is really
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the other one, it's like,
well, no, I don't really see much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only at the later stage, we're starting to
see difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we looked at the popping up of new
lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have, in here, you also have the
time after transfer to different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in this line that all of
the lateral roots, so, the line that was
[SPEAKER_00]: really struggling with the lateral root
elongation, you can see that the lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are popping out throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the average, yeah,
it is a little bit delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But average in that specific scenario is
not super informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at the other line,
you can see that all of the lateral roots
[SPEAKER_00]: that are indicated by the red bars are
clearly delayed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this super detailed time point allowed
us to select time points before we start
[SPEAKER_00]: to see visual differences that we then
harvested for the RNA-seq experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Mariam also did, because she has a
training as a reproductive biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: so she's not afraid of crossing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, she crossed those two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the root system
architecture of the F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, you know,
combining those two traits is just too
[SPEAKER_00]: good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, those two strategies seem to be
complementary because we don't see plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with either more lateral roots or longer
lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, we can significantly improve,
although both of those two lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever we look at them in the field or
in the plant accelerator, both of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still improve on the pretty
tolerant accessions by combining their
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary strategies, which I think is
really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we did, of course, we did all of
the genome-wide association.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Mariam crossed the F1, we also grew
them out for F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zhang Junfei helped us with the bulk
segregant analysis for all of those books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Liang Yu from Andrew's lab helped us
with the RNA-seq experiment and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have the genes that are associated
through GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the regions of the chromosomes
that are associated with the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: segregant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got individual gene
expressions that are differing between our
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is the overlap?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we found couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of the lines that,
or some of the genes that are the DUF
[SPEAKER_00]: 1677.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the strongest candidates,
but the DUF stands for basically domain of
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you for calling it anything,
but we cannot really, like, make too much
[SPEAKER_00]: sense out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other things that we found that are
described as something is this
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene-responsive transcription factor,
TO3, and ascorbate peroxidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, vitamin C peroxidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, having something to do with reactive
oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of months ago, Ron Mittler was
visiting Cornell, and Mariam went to his
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, and then she started, you know,
sending him messages like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron, can you image the roots of our
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we think there is something going
on with different reactive oxygen species
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ron was like, okay, cool, send me the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we sent him the seeds, and Santosh did
most of the experiments for growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, here's an example of how,
so they are really using a visualization
[SPEAKER_00]: for the hydrogen peroxide in live images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we have seen, and here we've got
accession number one, accession number two
[SPEAKER_00]: in root and in shoot, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay, this is complicated figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got accession number one is
having much more reactive oxygen species
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation quite early on in the root,
while the accession number two doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, nothing is happening in the root
whatsoever, but this one is having much
[SPEAKER_00]: more reactions in the shoot compared to
the root, compared to the, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: other accession, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have the ones that are,
if you don't have a reaction in the root,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have a reaction in the shoot,
and it's not necessarily sequential,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the shoot, we see the signal
building up much quicker than we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are the absolute differences in
the reactive oxygen species accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still cloning the genes,
and we're hoping to knock them out in both
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lines to see what is the effect,
but this is an intermediate reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, what we also did is,
this is another complicated graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also grew the plants with ascorbate and
with H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we're seeing in here,
so let's have a look at the salt stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red dots, and we've got the main root
growth rate, average lateral root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how fast is the main root growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast are the lateral roots growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly are they growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are new lateral roots popping up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this cultivated one is we've got,
okay, lateral root elongation is suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: more than number of lateral roots,
and in here, we've got an opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got lateral roots keep on
elongating, but the lateral root number is
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then, when we add, in here,
the green one is we add ascorbate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we add ascorbate, this pattern,
it's not really changing much because the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral roots are still growing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a little bit more lateral roots
popping up, but in here, ha-ha,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are reversing the pattern, so we are
rescuing the lateral roots and still grow
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, whenever we add hydrogen
peroxide into the plates, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: making everything even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this line, for whatever reason,
is like, ah, I'm still fine because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not related to ascorbate
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked on ion accumulation,
and we have noticed that the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ascorbate is lowering the potassium to
sodium ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, potassium to sodium ratio is important
because typically under salt stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium is out-competing the sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium is out-competing potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the higher that number is,
the worse the plant is getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, getting it lowered by ascorbate is a
great result, and it's reflecting kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes what are happening in the root
system architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's where we add with our,
like, molecular biology, following up,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also started to explore how we can
describe the root system architectures
[SPEAKER_00]: using different metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we were spending entire pandemic
looking at the roots and tracing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started to observe, like, a very
distinct pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got roots that are really
growing like a Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: or roots that are growing like a telephone
pole, a little bit droopier telephone
[SPEAKER_00]: pole, and a broomstick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all of the lateral roots are coming
from the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, you've got, it's really like
a maze root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, all of the roots, they are very
nicely spaced, but very definite length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that diversity of the
lateral root length as we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're like, wow, this is cool,
and I see it, and I know when I see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I'm using my metrics of lateral
root number per plant, average lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: root size, even branches on size,
I always have this one comparison that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I should have,
like, a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I describe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a never-ending conundrum of
anyone that is doing phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it with my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I translate it into a number?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I was like, oh, maybe I can combine
all of those three numbers, mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, Arjun Chandrasekhar,
who is a good friend and a mathematician,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, well, no, how about we just
calculate the Pareto front optimality for
[SPEAKER_00]: those root system architectures?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you've got all nicely separated
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, can you explain what this Pareto
front optimality is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the number, but how does the
number work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Pareto front optimality is really
designed for evaluating efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructures in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in here, we've got a subway network of
my favorite city in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that everyone,
you've got all of those neighborhoods that
[SPEAKER_00]: are semi-affordable to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone needs to go to the central
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got all of those hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, they're crossing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we can also think about,
like, that in the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all of the absorption happening
of nutrients and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, if you talk to people that are
working on modeling of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, we still don't really know how
the root is absorbing water, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: mind-boggling for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, but let's assume that we are
absorbing majority of water and nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: with the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we've got big pipes that are
doing majority of the transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we can think about it as
neighborhood that needs to get to central
[SPEAKER_00]: station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need to abstract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, abstracting the roots, we've got a
root system architecture, but we can
[SPEAKER_00]: connect all of our lateral roots in a very
fast way, in a very cheap way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some intermediate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, what Pareto front
optimality is saying, you don't have one
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal solution for your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a front of optimal solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how far from those optimal
solutions you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however, there are a couple of issues
with the Pareto front optimality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right now, we are assuming that
conductivity and the cost of a lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: root is exactly the same as for the main
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in here, this is a very quick
experiment that I did for this grant that
[SPEAKER_00]: we got, is looking at the number of xylem
vessels in the main root compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main pipes that are doing
the transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the blue things there's
huge difference in the xylem number and
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the xylem vessels that are
doing the transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's already an assumption that is
wrong, that we need to correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the number of the cortex layers
and all of the cells that needs to be not
[SPEAKER_00]: only built, but also maintained as the
root system architecture is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right now, what we're doing is we're
doing, so Emily and Trent have been really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing in collecting all of the root
sections for the main roots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best pictures I could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to kind of get them really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're quantifying basically all of the
vasculature, the surface area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex, the endodermis, epidermis,
and the xylem bundle sheet cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that between the lateral
root and the main root, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are differences in the
developmental stage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, your xylem bundles are looking very
different at the root tip, compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: very mature roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, we also are starting to
have the secondary growth, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right now, together with Arjun and
Guillaume Lobet from Belgium, we are
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating all of those physiologically
quite relevant features into our Pareto
[SPEAKER_00]: front optimality metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, using those adjusted models,
we're going to recalculate everything for
[SPEAKER_00]: our entire diversity panel and then use
that to run the genome-wide association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we're going to learn a
little bit more like which genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in optimal root system
architecture or optimizing the cost or the
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I want to just
briefly mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's a happy news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we have been awarded together
with a bunch of really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators from BTI, this FFAR grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got Sylvia Restrepo,
Jim Giovannoni, Julian Fay from our
[SPEAKER_00]: technology transfer office, Gagan from
Myogenics, and Zhang Junfei is really like
[SPEAKER_00]: the lead brain in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what we're going to do is
we're going to screen the wide tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity panel for drought stress
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Sylvia is going to do that for a
biotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really going to talk only about the
drought because that's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in here, so far, we only have focused
on Lycopersicum and Pimpinellifolium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is so many more tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what we wanted to really
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, are there much more cool
diversity strategies for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: different things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as you can think about, like,
drought is a complex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just measure, like, well,
do they survive or do they wilt,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, again, throwing a lot of complexity
into genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how are we going to dissect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And dissection is going through isolation
of individual fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to dissect it into daily
use of water, maintenance of growth rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health indices, and photosynthetic
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a combination of the tools that
MyLab has developed as well as phenocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I hope that this is just providing you
an overview of what are the tools that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available, and if you want to use some of
them, just let us know, and then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: either borrow you some of our cool toys,
because that's the best thing of,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, having cool toys, is sharing them,
or we can help you with setting up your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment for the phenocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first toy that was developed,
actually, by Olga Kamelinski, who is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD student in plant path, but was an
amazing undergraduate student,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this device that's called Osmo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Osmo is a little Arduino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a computer that's costing $20,
and we put that in a box with an LED
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, and it's connected to a scale and
a little water pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it looks in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we put all of the mess of the cables
in a box, and we connect that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, how it works is you hard code
all of the reference data for the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants onto the Arduino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the plants that are
mixed with drought control, and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that your control plants should be watered
to that specific reference weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your drought should be watered to,
let's say, 100 grams less, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you put your plant, pot number one,
and it's already hard coded that pot
[SPEAKER_00]: number one is control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, oh, okay, your measured weight is
below the reference weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I need to activate the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pump activated, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure the weight again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now the weight is above the
reference weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click this button, and then I can do the
pot number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you connect this little device into
a Windows-based laptop, because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work on anything else, unfortunately,
but it will also record all of the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: before and after watering, which gives you
cheap but dirty evapotranspiration data
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this evapotranspiration, here I've got
an example of cow pea plants that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to control and drought conditions,
and this is the average evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that definitely under control
and drought stress, we've got to decrease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also can see differences between
the individual genotypes in their
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, this is a very dirty trade,
but it's helping us provide to all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants exactly the same drought stress
treatment, and gets us data that is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, we're going into the maintenance of
the growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for this, we've got, we have built
something that's called the phenocage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as long as you're not working with
arabidopsis, turns out that plants have 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, and you kind of have to,
like, image them from all sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we did is we did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're putting a plant by hand on this
little display rotating ring that we
[SPEAKER_00]: bought off Amazon, and it's meant for
displaying jewelry in the shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also doing a great job at
displaying plants in the growth stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the picture how the plant
looks like, and again, this is an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cow pea, because the technician
that is starting the work on the FFIR
[SPEAKER_00]: started this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this, the plant is turning,
and we're taking seven consecutive images,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're doing it every three days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then afterwards, we're analyzing the
images, because we've got a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: wide background, we can quite easily
separate the plant bits from the
[SPEAKER_00]: background bits, and have that as a
projected shoot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the number is totally artificial,
but it does give you the increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the plant throughout the time,
in a non-destructive way, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely differentiate, again,
the control is blue here, the drought is
[SPEAKER_00]: red, you can differentiate it between your
control-grown plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: drought-stressed-grown plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this data, we can calculate the
growth rate throughout the experiments for
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the genotypes, which we have done
in here, and again, this is for cow pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, like, okay, so here I've
got, overall, my population kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased by 50%, but I can also do it
genotype-specific, and I can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, which genotypes are performing
relatively well, so close to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of them are above one,
which are suspicious, and which of my
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes are extremely tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole setup, in general,
is costing, like, $200 to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I built it up before we had the big,
fancy phenotyping facility set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we needed to collect some data,
but it's a very cost-effective way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the data out of your natural
diversity panel, and identifying which
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes are of high, high interest,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, we're getting to fancy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, screening for plant health indices,
so we're able, with phenocytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is using our fancy, cool
phenotyping facility at the BTI,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're able to, using a multi-spectral
camera, we are able to isolate the NDVI
[SPEAKER_00]: indices, as well as anthocyanin and
chlorophyll index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here you've got a tomato plant
growing, you've got the color images,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the NDVI index, chlorophyll
index, and anthocyanin index, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that they are changing at the
different time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got an example of an experiment
that we have done with tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to two different treatments,
represented by two different colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see that chlorophyll index,
anthocyanin index, and NDVI are showing a
[SPEAKER_00]: very different pattern throughout the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, really, and some of them are
somewhat related, so the anthocyanin and
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll index are showing some
similarities, but not always, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this very early time point that
this guy goes up and here nothing is
[SPEAKER_00]: really happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're really able to look at the
plant as if through different angles and
[SPEAKER_00]: different strategies, isolate those
different strategies more effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, we've got things that are having to
do with chlorophyll, fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know how about you,
but my photosynthesis was rusty before I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to work with this machine,
so I'm going to explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is happening, we're able to only
extract the data that is related to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, photosystem 2 is the one that is
absorbing most of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's happening, you've got a lot of
electrons going da-da-da-da.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do first is we need to
adapt our plants to dark, so all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons can chill the freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they chill out for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, we put the plant under a camera,
and then we put a tiny flash, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: can measure the minimum fluorescence,
and then we put them under a super
[SPEAKER_00]: saturating flash, so we can measure the
maximum fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the maximum amount of the
light that the chlorophyll can shine back
[SPEAKER_00]: at us.
Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximum minus minimum is FV, which is the
variable fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: FV over FM is quantum yield max.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maximum yield of your quantum yield of
photosystem 2, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, what we're doing is we're switching
the light back on under the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let it adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a Kowski effect, and that's
basically related to all of those photons
[SPEAKER_00]: are either shown back or slowly they are
being integrated into the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery, and that's whenever they are,
that's where we're seeing this drop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, we're adding this super
saturating flash, and then we're measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum, maximum fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we can quantify the quantum
yield, but it's not maximum quantum yield
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can see now this quantum yield
is so much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, once we've got that, we can calculate
non-photochemical quenching based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences from our light-adapted
chlorophyll fluorescence and dark-adapted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and photochemical quenching based on all
of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's a lot of data that we're
collecting, and we can do ratios and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, long story short is, and again,
we've got images of color, and then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: superimpose all of those calculations onto
individual pixels in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see like, oh, but there is
something happening to those leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really suffering at some point,
and how is that looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the suffering looking at different
traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're seeing very, very
different trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in here again, we've got experiment of
the tomatoes over the time, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that the V over FM is differing at
some point, but then it comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that shows you really the value of
looking at dynamic systems and looking as
[SPEAKER_00]: close as possible, because otherwise,
if we would measure only here and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be saying like, a V over FM,
not changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're looking through time,
we can see like, no, there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Q over FM, which is the light-adapted
quantum yield, it's not really different
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever, and we can see that
non-photochemical quenching, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some points where this is
significant, the differences between our
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, but the data is a little bit
messier here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it allows us to dissect all of
those responses into individual
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm not interested in learning
more about NPQ, FV over FM.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, as a root biologist, I use those
to indicate, is my plant okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is my plant doing well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is my fitness, rather than
waiting and growing my plant all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the seed and counting the seeds that my
plant is producing, because as I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: before, natural diversity panel,
that thing is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I do that at the same moment that
I'm looking at my roots, maybe this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: a useful data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before, I have two slides,
no, three slides left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just summarizing the phenocyte
features and capabilities, we can image up
[SPEAKER_00]: to one meter tall plants, which is three
foot for the people that don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a capacity of 64 large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have grown citrus trees,
we have grown tomatoes, we have grown
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, we have grown sataria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sataria is a tricky one, but we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have grown Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Arabidopsis, we can actually grow
20 plants in one of the tray, which
[SPEAKER_00]: increases our capacity to 1,280 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we have RGB imaging that this mask
with chlorophyll fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is allowing us to do automatically
calculation of the plant size and the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have photosynthetic efficiencies,
indices, and high precision watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't need to come and water those
plants because the machine does it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do you get to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I left a couple of stickers next to
the coffee area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you go on the website, there is a
project intake form available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can download it, you can fill it
up to as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you don't really know what you
want, but it gives us a good starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point for a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, once we've got this form filled up as
much as possible, then we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's the person that is doing the
experiment, it's me, and it's Julie Bell
[SPEAKER_00]: from the greenhouse facilities in BTI,
just to kind of make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse facilities can provide the
conditions that you need for your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments, that we are not
over-promising you so that we can track
[SPEAKER_00]: the movement of the microbes in your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then, once we've got that done,
we've got the project agreement proposed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the costs, we grow the plants within
the dedicated BTI phenotyping facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we provide you with is your raw
data, but also some level of pre-analyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: data in R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, the same graphs that I
showed you in the previous slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got the changes throughout
the time and also those P values,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when are they starting to be
significantly different from each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: we already have pipelines for that,
so you don't have to figure it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can keep on collaborating whether
you want to have something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to have one leaf analyzed
in your experiment rather than the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also provide you with the snapshot
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you've got plants growing,
preferably in the greenhouse of BTI,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have had some insect
introduction from the gutter men recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we would like to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you grow the plants within the
facility, you can come in and we can open
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine and just make one snapshot
data individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riley has done that, so if you've got any
questions for her user experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: please come and talk to her or me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, kind of summing up my entire
talk of today, so a few take-home
[SPEAKER_00]: messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think studying stress-resilient
plants, like wild and cultivated tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: can provide new strategies for improved
performance under very bad conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you have prioritizing different
components of root system architecture can
[SPEAKER_00]: be combined to further improve the
tolerance, and also there are new ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working on the new ways of
quantifying the roots because we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: those natural diversity panels,
and we have not observed Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: broomstick, and the telephone pole in
Arabianopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have started to think about how
are we going to describe those roots in
[SPEAKER_00]: root system architectures by working with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that I showed you a couple of
cost-efficient phenotyping tools that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can either build yourself or we can help
you build them with you to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: drought stress responses, but they can be
used for identifying any responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working on pathogens,
probably also quite useful, or nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, with the phenocyte,
we can provide you with a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: depth in your environmental response and
quantifying that environmental response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is all that I wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this work wouldn't be possible
without the amazing lab members that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had, plenty of fantastic collaborators,
and also I wanted to give a big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the BTI Plant Growth Facilities team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been very, very great in helping
me deal with the monster that the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenocyte is sometimes, and it's sometimes
giving us a lot of headaches, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out together and we're making it
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the work on the
pimpinellifolium initially started in
[SPEAKER_00]: KAUST in the group of this guy,
Mark Tester, and I was lucky enough that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could take a lot of it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your attention,
and I'm happy to hear any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said you don't really know how
water is taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, my question is, what do you mean by
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second question is, what role are
you looking also at the role of the
[SPEAKER_03]: endometriosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, great question.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will repeat the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the question is, what do I mean by the
fact that we don't know how water is being
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is, are we including
endodermis exodermis in our water
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, both of the questions are pertaining
in the cross-sections that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting of the lateral roots and main
roots and including them in the pareto
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, we are including endodermis
exodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that I was making these
figures, we haven't done the staining yet
[SPEAKER_00]: for the superization, but yes,
we know that the exodermis is forming
[SPEAKER_00]: first endodermis and endodermis is forming
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are including them in the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has ever looked at the exodermis
and endodermis formation in the lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, which is mind-blowing to me that
nobody has done that, but knowing how
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult it is to get those lateral roots
cross-sections, I start understanding why
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody has done that, because those roots
are very finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're embedding it in the plastic
resin, which is, as you probably know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we stain the whole root without a
cross-section?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, we could potentially,
but because we already have the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-sections, might as well just stain
those cross-sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I answered your second question first,
now let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by we don't know how water
is being taken up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sure the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about, okay, so,
and I have been having a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with Guillaume and people in
Louvain that are developing a lot of water
[SPEAKER_00]: transport models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you would think that they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is majority of the water
being taken up by the root tips or
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout, sorry, throughout the main
roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the majority of the models are
actually developed using monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocots, they have, what, the vasculature
is changing and the conductivity is
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got axial conductivity and,
no, radial conductivity and axial
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, axial conductivity, no, radial
conductivity is decreasing with the age of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root and axial conductivity is
increasing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the older roots are kind of becoming
more pipes rather than absorbent,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for monocots and the monocots
don't show any change in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots, on the other hand, we do have
secondary growth in the dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they have, and Marco is a PhD student
of Guillaume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco hates me for that because I forced
them to develop those models for tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, in dicots we've
got secondary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, your diameter is not changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, even though you've got axial
conductivity, no, sorry, radial,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, radial conductivity decreasing
because you've got those endodermal
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you've got more woody stuff
happening and so forth, your diameter is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the increase of that diameter is
sufficient for kind of counteracting that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that we're seeing in the monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the thick roots and dicots are
absorbing just as much as the thin roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to their models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're trying to kind of like see
what's happening if we, what can we learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from the model into the real life and can
we just grow plants with thick roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: just chop off those main root meristems
because we apparently don't need them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what I mean by we don't really
know how the water is being taken up
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't know what features are
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we do need, we do know that
features like cortex are not, number of
[SPEAKER_00]: cortex layers, it's not really playing
much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number and the size of the xylem
vessels is endodermis, exodermis is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely playing the majority of the big
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know how it's working with
the root diameter is increasing because
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sudden things are being like,
it's not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the way, it's good that they
developed all of those models on monocots
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a simple system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going, we're upgrading into
the dicots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about the two tomatoes
and the cross.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, was there any differences
in associations with mycorrhizals,
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal associations and the cross,
does that change it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Claire is asking whether there is a
difference between the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grown those plants in the sterile
conditions on the agar plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know at all with the
mycorrhizal association.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are performing both equally well when
we grow them in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't incubate any mycorrhizal
communities at all, but I assume that they
[SPEAKER_00]: just emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see potentially there is definitely
potential there, but we haven't studied it
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to have some seeds,
we can certainly give you some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, so you have the
differences in the root architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the hybrid line, do you see a
difference in the Ross accumulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam is asking whether we see differences
in the Ross accumulation in the F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not looked at that because we had
so few seeds of the F1 and we haven't sent
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Ron because we were like,
well, how about we establish this
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they haven't done the roots before
because they were like, oh, roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of out of fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only do shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, roots are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see huge differences in the stress
response between the roots and the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, now we convince them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a great idea to do that on the
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't done RNA seq on the F1 as
well, which would be another way of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of helping us figuring out not the cyst
and the trans of it all, but also which of
[SPEAKER_00]: the responses are dominant from which
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you determine that the change in
architecture is actually adaptive?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you know that this change is the
consequence of stress risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so Jan is asking how are we going to
identify whether change in the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture is an adaptive response?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're assuming that natural variation
and we assume that the maintenance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is something that is adaptive over
the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you've got roots that are
growing, and I think Jose did any
[SPEAKER_00]: published on that, if you've got roots
that are kind of keep on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the stress exposure and they
don't stop and think, they typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the meristem activity is decreasing
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't, we are focusing on the
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focusing on the maintain meristem
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that is allowing us to then
say like, OK, well, if you've got after a
[SPEAKER_00]: week of stress, if you still keep on
growing, it means that, OK, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the stress
concentrations that are as physiologically
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on 75 max 125 millimolar
salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to stay away from osmotic
shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's, I think that's also not
how salt stress is typically occurring in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also one of the reasons that we
want to add that we still, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I have presented is a very
descriptive studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to identify the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we're at the genes, then we can
say, is it adaptive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not adaptive?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely something that we have to
keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that things are changing or
stopping growing, it's not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maintenance of growth, we are assuming
that that's what the plant wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
