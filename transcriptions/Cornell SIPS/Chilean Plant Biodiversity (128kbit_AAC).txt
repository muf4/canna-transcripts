[SPEAKER_08]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: This presentation is actually a student
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Mark Bridgen, and I'm one of
the co-instructors of this class.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Betsy Lamb is the other instructor of
this class.
[SPEAKER_04]: The class began last fall semester with
actual classroom discussions about plant
[SPEAKER_04]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we prepared for a January winter
session break trip to the country of
[SPEAKER_04]: Chile, which we're going to talk to you
about today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this semester, we're finishing up
the class.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a half semester class.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, this is the last final
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more meeting tomorrow,
and then that's it for the class.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to thank our benefactor,
Susan Lynch, who wanted to be here today,
[SPEAKER_04]: but she's going to Europe tomorrow,
and she couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she actually paid for the class to go
to Chile.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had 16 students in the class.
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 were undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two were graduate students.
[SPEAKER_04]: A year ago, about this time, Dr. Lamb and
I interviewed students for the class,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we chose the 16 students who were
going to attend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to pass the mic over to
Hannah, one of the graduate students,
[SPEAKER_04]: and she's going to start us off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming today.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of an exciting day to be able to
share a lot of what we've been learning
[SPEAKER_09]: and talking about and discussing over the
last almost year, I guess, or all of last
[SPEAKER_09]: semester, pretty much, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it feels like a nice way to kind of
wrap up what we've learned.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did want to start today by just kind
of giving a little bit of a background
[SPEAKER_09]: about where we went, which was,
in fact, Chile.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not familiar, Chile is a long
country in southern South America,
[SPEAKER_09]: runs about 6,500 kilometers of coastline
on the western side of South America,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is about 4,000 miles long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And being that long, stretches about 39
different degrees of latitude.
[SPEAKER_09]: In total, its size equals about two sizes
of Montana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Double Montana size or so.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's actually a relatively large
country, just more in its latitude than
[SPEAKER_09]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is now a presidential republic that
gained independence from Spain in 1810.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Spanish would be the primary language
that we encountered.
[SPEAKER_09]: Population is about 17 million,
which would be like two New York cities in
[SPEAKER_09]: total population.
[SPEAKER_09]: 90% of that population is centrally
located around the capital city of
[SPEAKER_09]: Santiago.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, about 9% of the total population
is also represented by Mapuche indigenous
[SPEAKER_09]: inhabitants as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's good to recognize that that's
still a relatively large percentage of the
[SPEAKER_09]: culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is interesting and most
applicable to this discussion would be
[SPEAKER_09]: that Chile is, in fact, a biodiversity
hotspot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we say hotspot, we're referring
to a biologically diverse region,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is represented by many different
species and is also relatively threatened
[SPEAKER_09]: in terms of its species diversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Chile is an interesting place to
not only visit culturally, but interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: to visit from a plant biodiversity
perspective if we are interested in
[SPEAKER_09]: learning how to conserve and preserve
biodiversity worldwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of its biodiversity is shaped by the
diverse ecosystems present within the
[SPEAKER_09]: country.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so on the western side, we have the
coastline and low coastal mountains in the
[SPEAKER_09]: mid ranges.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's central valleys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on the eastern side, it's
bordered by the Andes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of that is combined with an
oceanic Humboldt current, which provides
[SPEAKER_09]: lots of different ecosystems and diversity
across the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the biodiversity is shaped by the
ecosystems as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to give you a little bit of an
example, we had one of our students,
[SPEAKER_09]: Yuki, who is our resident orchid expert,
put together a really wonderful poster
[SPEAKER_09]: outside if you want to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was really interested in learning
about Chilean orchids, of which there are
[SPEAKER_09]: about 72 different orchid species just in
Chile, 32 of which are endemic.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is, they can only be found in Chile.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting to learn that because
they're also relatively poorly studied in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of their ecology and taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so knowing that that diversity exists
is kind of impetuous to learn a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: more.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're very interesting in that
they're geophytes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're propagated by rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're polyploids.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they might have potential for hybrid
production.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're easy to care for and maintain in
terms of their temperature and water
[SPEAKER_09]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also have distinctive floral
traits, which could be very interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: for commercialization or advanced breeding
programs as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when we're thinking about this
diversity, understanding it's important in
[SPEAKER_09]: order to be able to use it in any sort of
a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_09]: But bottom line is we need more taxonomic.
[SPEAKER_09]: and ecological research.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to learn how to educate and reduce
disturbance to these natural habitats in
[SPEAKER_09]: which the orchids grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to promote public awareness and
education, as I said, all in order to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to support any sort of commercial
breeding programs in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to throw that in there
because that was one really big example we
[SPEAKER_09]: kept coming back to and one that
gravitated with one of the students on the
[SPEAKER_09]: trip too.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to give you an overview of where we
went, we like barely scratched the surface
[SPEAKER_09]: of Chile.
[SPEAKER_09]: On this, I think, 14 day trip that we went
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to four major regions across the
country.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started off, flew into Santiago,
spent a couple days going around the
[SPEAKER_09]: region visiting a botanical park,
some companies in their area, and a ski
[SPEAKER_09]: resort that also, at one point,
had a lot of biodiversity in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we headed south down to Talca,
where we visited University of Talca.
[SPEAKER_09]: Went a little bit further south of
Valdivia, where we visited India.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then another university down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ended up, one of our last days,
visiting a national park in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then headed back up to Santiago and
took right off from there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in total, our distance that we traveled
is about 500 miles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I said, this is about 4,000 miles
of a country in its coastline.
[SPEAKER_09]: So barely scratched the surface again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we went, we went with a few
objectives, not just to holistically
[SPEAKER_09]: understand plant biodiversity,
but each student in the class was also
[SPEAKER_09]: assigned a topic area of focus.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so throughout the trip, we were asked
to focus in on a particular topic
[SPEAKER_09]: emphasis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we included cultural sites,
plant breeding, agricultural production,
[SPEAKER_09]: botanical gardens, native plants,
and Chilean biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And used these as lenses through which we
can understand biodiversity and how these
[SPEAKER_09]: different topics impacted biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've really framed this talk to
kind of go through these different topic
[SPEAKER_09]: and focus areas as a way of kind of
explaining plant biodiversity in Chile to
[SPEAKER_09]: you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how we're going to approach these
topics is kind of through our journey
[SPEAKER_09]: lens, or our traveler's lens, I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think typically when we travel,
we might go in to our trip or the place
[SPEAKER_09]: we're visiting with some sort of existing
preconceived notions about what it means,
[SPEAKER_09]: or what it is, or in this case,
what plant biodiversity is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had all these definitions in our
minds, and we had been talking about them
[SPEAKER_09]: this semester before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we thought we had a pretty good
grip on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then you go, and you get totally out
of your element, and you realize,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, shoot, I don't really actually know
that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you did know a lot, you know,
you probably still learned something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you didn't learn anything,
then maybe you just came to appreciate the
[SPEAKER_09]: world more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'm trying to say is that when you
travel, you kind of go from an existing
[SPEAKER_09]: paradigm to something that's a little bit
of a shifted paradigm every time we
[SPEAKER_09]: travel.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we'll be presenting these topics
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the students who took on each topic
will be presenting today, kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: explaining what we thought we knew about
it before going and what we learned from
[SPEAKER_09]: it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, we'll get started with our
first topic, which was cultural sites.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here is Zoe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And previously, we thought that humans
play a fundamental role and can
[SPEAKER_08]: drastically influence an ecosystem's
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether that means going forward and
protecting the sites and doing
[SPEAKER_08]: conservation efforts, or the other way
around, where we're destroying these sites
[SPEAKER_08]: and kind of polluting the areas and not
paying much attention to the biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other hand, cultural sites draw
tourists and traffic to these certain
[SPEAKER_08]: areas, looking specifically at the sites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So different types of parks that we could
have visited.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this could be positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could be whether using sites for
an educational outlet to really teach
[SPEAKER_08]: people about what biodiversity is present
there, or just having heavy traffic and
[SPEAKER_08]: running the areas down and kind of not
paying attention to all the resources that
[SPEAKER_08]: are available in those areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Associated with urban areas, potential for
habitat loss and reduction of
[SPEAKER_08]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And an example, we went to a park that was
specifically for a kind of town hall area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had a huge area that was just
grass, because it was kind of a
[SPEAKER_08]: westernized lens of you need to have a
huge area of grass in order to be a park.
[SPEAKER_08]: But was this really good for the
biodiversity or just good for thought and
[SPEAKER_08]: laying on the grass and enjoying yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we got there, we kind of were a
little bit confused, at least me and my
[SPEAKER_08]: partner were in the beginning,
because we have these great cultural
[SPEAKER_08]: sites, which could be a big park with
Virgin Mary that we got to see and look
[SPEAKER_08]: at.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what really is the connection between
the plants that are there and the cultural
[SPEAKER_08]: awareness and significance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had at the beginning that difficulty
of understanding the immediate connection.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we kind of came to the idea that with
conservation of culture can run
[SPEAKER_08]: simultaneously with the conservation of
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found that appreciation of cultural
heritage could be intertwined with an
[SPEAKER_08]: uplifting of traditionally valued plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So an example of this is the Mapuche,
which are the largest group of native
[SPEAKER_08]: Indians in all of South America.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we got to go to a research area and
learn about Maki, which is one of their
[SPEAKER_08]: native plants, which they use for
medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have a really close connection
between the way that they cultivate plants
[SPEAKER_08]: and an economy that is really based on
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this Maki is really significant to the
way that they heal and that they produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: So learning more about them really,
we found that connection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Between culture and agriculture and
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to pass it off to plant
breeding right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Karl Kunze, and I'm a senior in
plant science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, along with Emma and Blue,
took on the role of understanding how
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding relates to plant
biodiversity in Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant breeding is defined here as the
genetic improvement of plants for human
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can imagine, they can have both
some positive effects and negative effects
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these breeding projects that we saw
in Chile, some of them relied on
[SPEAKER_01]: generation diverse populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the breeding process results in new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of conditions in Chile
itself that made it, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite desirable for plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is their export and their economy is
very reliant on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a result, they're going to need
plant breeding efforts to meet those
[SPEAKER_01]: demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the varied environments that
they have in Chile, which helps promote
[SPEAKER_01]: native plant biodiversity, that also helps
in diversification of crops that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in Chile and can also be exported.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, though, there was a little bit of
a lack of plant breeders or development in
[SPEAKER_01]: Chile, namely because most of the efforts
go towards exporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it comes to huge commodity
crops like maize and soybean, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding efforts are going to go towards
where those crops are grown throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: where the largest market is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, Monsanto had their own
research station there, however,
[SPEAKER_01]: that most we serve to benefit North
American growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are some institutions in
Chile that are working on breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: their crops within Chile and then
exporting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, our apple breeder,
second pictured it down, he was part of an
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative by Chile to help sell and
export their apples market with the
[SPEAKER_01]: counter season that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, throughout most of our efforts,
we generally agreed that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding efforts that are going on in
Chile kind of detracted from the native
[SPEAKER_01]: plant biodiversity mostly by means of
using resources and how much are you going
[SPEAKER_01]: to really put back into the local economy
and sustain it without relying completely
[SPEAKER_01]: on exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are certain programs that
we saw which promoted a little more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: native plant biodiversity than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the potato germplasm in
Valdivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their efforts were to gain different
native cultivars of potatoes throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the country and then breed them for
phytophthora resistance and yield as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to Monsanto which was almost
strictly for American use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple breeding for export markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very much efforts into the local
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pinot Pijo which we visited which also
produces seeds for export markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Alicia Avendross.
[SPEAKER_10]: My topic that I'll be talking to you guys
about today is agricultural production
[SPEAKER_10]: which was of great interest of mine
because I come from an agricultural
[SPEAKER_10]: background and I'm a senior in plant
science so I'll be going very straight
[SPEAKER_10]: back into that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were really fortunate actually to be
able to see a lot of different
[SPEAKER_10]: agricultural sectors in our journey to
Chile.
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw viticulture, fruit, vegetable
production, seed production for vegetable
[SPEAKER_10]: production, large scale agronomy in the
form of Monsanto, dairy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we really got to touch a lot of
different sectors.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually see a picture here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to do a wine tasting at the
university.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we knew going into the trip was
that really Chile utilizes our off season.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was really exemplified over and
over again every time we got to see these
[SPEAKER_10]: different agricultural sectors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just how much they export to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: or to the Northern Hemisphere in general.
[SPEAKER_10]: An example of that is the fruit market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are their third most important
economic sector in Chile.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is actually fruit production.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's after copper production and
something else but copper is first.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they produce almost all of their fruit
that they produce actually goes to the
[SPEAKER_10]: Northern Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we did get to see was that there
was really a wide spread kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: production of a westernized system of
large monoculture and just large scale
[SPEAKER_10]: production.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that they were really trying hard in
Chile to kind of compete on that global
[SPEAKER_10]: scale by producing in a monoculture very
efficient manner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course as we know monoculture is quite
detrimental to biodiversity and plant
[SPEAKER_10]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: But economically Chile is actually quite
sound because of their agricultural
[SPEAKER_10]: production.
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course as you know these westernized
plants are being pushed like corn,
[SPEAKER_10]: large scale corn production.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did see a lot of neglect towards the
native species and some issues surrounding
[SPEAKER_10]: invasive pathogens or invasive plant
species that kind of come as a result of
[SPEAKER_10]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess what we really saw shift in our
time in Chile was just how dependent the
[SPEAKER_10]: agricultural sector is on export.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we kind of knew going in that Chile was
exporting to the Northern Hemisphere in
[SPEAKER_10]: our off season.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we can't produce apples for
example Chile is doing that and exporting
[SPEAKER_10]: to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was just another level to actually
go there and experience and see just how
[SPEAKER_10]: much their markets were all based around
our consumption.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that kind of dependency was really
significant and for example we learned
[SPEAKER_10]: about hazelnuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: The country actually exports I think 90%
of their hazelnuts to Ferrero.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just a really good example of
just how dependent their markets are on
[SPEAKER_10]: one western or Northern Hemisphere
company.
[SPEAKER_10]: And again what was really exemplified was
just how much that devalues their own
[SPEAKER_10]: consumption of native plants or
incorporation of native plants into their
[SPEAKER_10]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah we kind of put our thinking caps
on as a group and talked about maybe some
[SPEAKER_10]: ways that agricultural production could be
changed in Chile or in general to become a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit more biodiverse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of these things are you know
topics that are touched upon again and
[SPEAKER_10]: again in lecture and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: But one thing that came up was maybe doing
some more agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know moving away from the large scale
monoculture and just integrating a more
[SPEAKER_10]: diverse system again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Promoting more local consumption so they
get more of a local consumption or
[SPEAKER_10]: industry based or yeah they should start
being able to consume their own products
[SPEAKER_10]: instead of just being so dependent on the
export to the North.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe just creating some more
protected land and doing more research to
[SPEAKER_10]: use native species in an efficient and
agricultural manner.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah I think agriculture in summary was
a very, very fascinating topic and just
[SPEAKER_10]: reoccurred almost at every single stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was for plant breeding like Carl
just mentioned or even in a cultural sense
[SPEAKER_10]: just to see how much that agricultural
industry had influenced the people there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to hand it off to Patty.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Patty and I'm a junior in plant
sciences and I'm here to discuss botanical
[SPEAKER_06]: gardens which we touched on in two
locations during our trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to start off with what is the purpose
of botanical garden and what are the goals
[SPEAKER_06]: of having them in locations like the ones
that we saw in Chile.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when asked many professionals in
conservation state that as often they're
[SPEAKER_06]: limiting factors are in funding and public
awareness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And having botanical gardens is something
that bridges the gap between the public
[SPEAKER_06]: and plant science to educate them about
the plants that exist and native and
[SPEAKER_06]: endemic species in the area.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition these gardens can also
cultivate these native and endemic and
[SPEAKER_06]: often endangered species which preserves
the germplasm of the plants and in
[SPEAKER_06]: addition preserves the knowledge of how to
cultivate these plants and the techniques
[SPEAKER_06]: such as pollination or germination of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did visit two gardens while we were
here in Chile.
[SPEAKER_06]: We visited Quilapilun by Santiago and we
also saw the garden belong to the
[SPEAKER_06]: University of Talca.
[SPEAKER_06]: The garden of Quilapilun was more centered
on the native plants in Chile and section
[SPEAKER_06]: out all of their plants according to the
area and their proximity to the coast kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of doing a cross section across the
country and then a cross section down the
[SPEAKER_06]: country correlating them to their
environment while the garden at the
[SPEAKER_06]: University of Talca was more centered on a
kind of general garden sense and plants
[SPEAKER_06]: not necessarily native to the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did face some unique challenges.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example Chile in particular is a very
dry country and climate trends are showing
[SPEAKER_06]: that in future years the rainfall amounts
are going to be lower and lower so the
[SPEAKER_06]: gardens are having to accommodate that and
due to that we questioned some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: choices of the more European and northern
hemisphere species for aesthetic purposes
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in parks in the city but also
present in some part in these botanical
[SPEAKER_06]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did mitigate this by using different
types of rocks as ground cover as opposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to grass which reduced their consumption
of water as a valuable resource and
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely promoted the use of native
plants in things like landscaping and we
[SPEAKER_06]: also will touch on that later in our
native plant slides.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to that they needed different
strategies to attract the public to these
[SPEAKER_06]: gardens because plants in general are
sometimes overlooked and we noticed that
[SPEAKER_06]: the garden at the University of Talca had
a lot of free roaming animals such as
[SPEAKER_06]: horses and alpacas and a variety of birds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of like fun things for the kids to
look at and having it be a nice like kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of day in the park atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were also different events that were
hosted at these which we got a glimpse of
[SPEAKER_06]: in the pamphlets and in addition
Quilapilun did display cultural and
[SPEAKER_06]: historic information about the indigenous
people of the area which we found was
[SPEAKER_06]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: In general we did find that they could
have held more maybe events or just kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of activities that had the public interact
with the garden at more of a deeper level
[SPEAKER_06]: than just walking down the paths but they
did seem to achieve a lot of their goals
[SPEAKER_06]: of public awareness and education and I
will pass this back on to Hannah to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we went we obviously kind of went
with this holistic understanding that
[SPEAKER_09]: Chile is very diverse in its plant species
and we also went with this understanding
[SPEAKER_09]: that native plants are really intricately
tied to local and indigenous cultures and
[SPEAKER_09]: so there's a really strong bond there that
does exist and because of that
[SPEAKER_09]: conservation and protection of those
native organisms is really important to
[SPEAKER_09]: preserve both the sanctity of the natural
ecosystem but also preserve any of the
[SPEAKER_09]: aesthetic or cultural or economic value
that accompanies native plants within a
[SPEAKER_09]: region too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we had kind of this holistic
understanding however when we went we
[SPEAKER_09]: actually learned a lot about the role of
native plants in Chile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps the most depressing of which was
that they're being lost due to human
[SPEAKER_09]: activity and whether that is construction
or mining or tourism or just increased
[SPEAKER_09]: foot traffic we did see detrimental
impacts to the native plant populations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We visited Laguna de Mall which was kind
of on the border of Argentina and we were
[SPEAKER_09]: with a tour guide who was trying to find
this very specific plant and we got out
[SPEAKER_09]: there and she said oops it's not here
anymore and so that entire population was
[SPEAKER_09]: completely lost and unfortunately we
weren't able to see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the more positive note we did see
some good examples of preserving native
[SPEAKER_09]: plant species such as the Maki breeding
program which was as we mentioned a berry
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding program of a native plant Maki
which is important to the Mapuche culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this program went around the country
collected lots of different clones of the
[SPEAKER_09]: Maki species and is now performing in situ
preservation and selection of different
[SPEAKER_09]: clones for potential commercialization of
the Maki berry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in doing so also brought up a lot of
questions and considerations regarding the
[SPEAKER_09]: ethics behind breeding and
commercialization of these native plants
[SPEAKER_09]: and that who exactly is benefiting from
the use of native plants and their
[SPEAKER_09]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally we also noted a really
large trend to utilize and incorporate
[SPEAKER_09]: these native plants into landscaping
materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was we saw several different examples
but I think we all had a really good
[SPEAKER_09]: experience when we were able to visit an
entire plant nursery focused on native
[SPEAKER_09]: plant sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: The owner had set it up so that it was
very easy for any customers to understand
[SPEAKER_09]: where the native plants might be best
incorporated into the landscape and then
[SPEAKER_09]: had lots of educational materials about
the native species as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was in some sense a mixture of a
business and a botanic garden too in the
[SPEAKER_09]: role it was playing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless we walked away knowing that
native plants are very important.
[SPEAKER_09]: We still need to have work to preserve
them however they're becoming a bit more
[SPEAKER_09]: popularized and understood too which was
good to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally our last topic will end us on
the whole Chilean biodiversity scope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while Chilean biodiversity was not my
topic that I focused on during this trip I
[SPEAKER_07]: am more than happy to present it on behalf
of the students that could not be here
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we began our journey for this trip
and in the pre-class that we had we did a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of background research on just the
biodiversity of Chile and the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: species that existed there in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we found that Chile's unique
landscape had led to a very high diversity
[SPEAKER_07]: of plant species and with that there's
over 5,100 species of flora and fauna and
[SPEAKER_07]: with that half of those are endemic
meaning that they're found only within
[SPEAKER_07]: Chile.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's obvious to see how important those
species are to Chile as a whole and the
[SPEAKER_07]: ecosystems that exist there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the high plant biodiversity is mostly
found in national parks and underdeveloped
[SPEAKER_07]: regions which you could probably blame
maybe on human interactions in the other
[SPEAKER_07]: areas so when we don't have humans there's
probably a higher chance that the species
[SPEAKER_07]: will be able to exist there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So during our trip in seeing all the
national parks and the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_07]: facilities and all the places that we were
able to visit we saw that the efforts to
[SPEAKER_07]: educate the public and preserve
biodiversity sites should be continued
[SPEAKER_07]: because there were was a bit of a gap
between what we had researched and what we
[SPEAKER_07]: saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we found that there's a need to
initiate plant programs to preserve
[SPEAKER_07]: biodiversity within the food systems and
that was just again with like the mocky
[SPEAKER_07]: berries and seeing how important those
were to the cultures and so you could
[SPEAKER_07]: again tie in biodiversity as a whole to
both cultural sites and it's all relative
[SPEAKER_07]: and interconnected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we also when we got back we put
together a lot of comments so one student
[SPEAKER_07]: said that ultimately Chile's biodiversity
is a wonder that must be conserved.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wealth of plant exists nowhere else in
the world and it seems that many people
[SPEAKER_07]: are not fully aware of this wealth or the
importance that it has both culturally and
[SPEAKER_07]: ecologically.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that just when we went to Chile to
look at biodiversity we found that yes it
[SPEAKER_07]: was important that there was issues with
preserving it and keeping it the way that
[SPEAKER_07]: it was so it's just very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hand it back to Hannah for
our closing remarks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So while we did go with educational
purposes and we did learn a lot I just
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of wanted to mention that we had fun
too on the trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: We learned a lot about each other
traveling with 16 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be challenging but we actually had
a really cohesive group that I think
[SPEAKER_09]: supported each other really well and the
dynamics worked.
[SPEAKER_09]: We learned that everyone's very good at
sleeping on the bus.
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of came to the consensus of peace
coast showers are really good so if you
[SPEAKER_09]: ever get the chance to go down there do
try them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a couple which maybe that helped
why we were so good at sleeping on the
[SPEAKER_09]: bus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless we had a good bus driver
and he was super good at ping pong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark and Betsy maybe illegally hopped a
fence into a national forest and then
[SPEAKER_09]: convinced all of us to go along.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not our fault if we get in trouble
later.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we all came back and I think we
kind of came to a consensus that our
[SPEAKER_09]: favorite part of the entire trip was a
lunch we had at a native plant nursery.
[SPEAKER_09]: In which we had just walked around the
owner's business and learned all about
[SPEAKER_09]: native plants and her philosophies on how
they can be integrated into Chilean
[SPEAKER_09]: culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we had a beautiful home cooked
meal and it was one of the best dates of
[SPEAKER_09]: my life and I think everyone else's.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to mention that we did in
fact have fun and learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: In summary I think what we walked away
knowing and learning is that the solutions
[SPEAKER_09]: to conserving and preserving biodiversity
are really complex and that we do need to
[SPEAKER_09]: approach it in a multifaceted mindset and
requires systems thinking as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless education and continued
exposure through multiple outlets is going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be critical in order to do so.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think as I mentioned we used that
existing paradigm shifted paradigm means
[SPEAKER_09]: of exploring our different topics but we
really went from abstract kind of textbook
[SPEAKER_09]: definitions of some of these topics to
something that's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_09]: tangible and experiential.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really is I think the purpose of
traveling and is to have these personal
[SPEAKER_09]: experiences that impact you and impact
your future actions and behaviors very
[SPEAKER_09]: profoundly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if given the opportunity to travel
in this educational setting I encourage
[SPEAKER_09]: all of you to I know I benefited
tremendously and learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that we have many people to
thank.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had constant translators and tour
guides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with us and met up with many
knowledgeable plant specialists while we
[SPEAKER_09]: were there too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're very very lucky and then I guess
we'd also like to thank Susan Lynch our
[SPEAKER_09]: benefactor first and foremost for being
able to go but then also thank Mark and
[SPEAKER_09]: Betsy for taking us along too on the trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: With that if you have any questions I
think we're here and we're happy to answer
[SPEAKER_09]: any we can.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Chile this past January but I
went to the Alicama Desert and I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: wondering if there are any plant
specialists here who have any experience
[SPEAKER_12]: with the desert plants there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark's been 21 times to Chile so he passes
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to go to the Alicama
Desert January is not the time to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: January between September 15th and October
15th is when the desert is in bloom if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it may not rain for five or six years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well it was raining when I was there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was raining early.
[SPEAKER_12]: In January?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was there for two torrential downpours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well you know that's interesting because
last year they had that same situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually rained I think it was April or
May.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't usually rain before July and
they had a very early bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe climate change is real.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went with the academic schedule though.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that plant that looks like?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very very dense slow growing plant
that some people burn in high altitudes
[SPEAKER_05]: for warmth because it is so high in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the size of a sofa can be and
it's dense enough that you can lie on it
[SPEAKER_05]: like a sofa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really really tiny little leaf so
it looks from afar like green goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see any green goo?
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not see any green goo.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did see a lot of rica rica and
chichicatilla which is pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I saw actually in the hot springs
there were these beautiful giant grasses
[SPEAKER_12]: that didn't exist anywhere else in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these amazing beautiful golden grassy
tufts that just like would cover a
[SPEAKER_12]: hillside.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should talk maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well if it was raining in January it
should be April which is their fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be time to go back if you're looking
for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also along the coast of Chile
sometimes there's an area called Frey
[SPEAKER_04]: Jorge up in the desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the southern part of the desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of an interesting ecological
system because it's on a very steep cliff
[SPEAKER_04]: right next to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every day as the fog comes in off
the ocean it will raise because it hits
[SPEAKER_04]: the cliff and then it condenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it actually gets enough moisture
that that will fly almost every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ever want to go back to Frey
Jorge it's a good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it doesn't rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were mentioning that so much of the
crops that are produced there are imported
[SPEAKER_05]: to North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do people there eat the food that
they're growing for export or do they eat
[SPEAKER_05]: like warmer?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we learned was that...
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess my answer to that would be
that there's a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_10]: agriculture and a lot of different types
or a lot of different ways that the food
[SPEAKER_10]: is moving around the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one large scale producer that I spoke
to personally who produces apples said
[SPEAKER_10]: that they at the sorting table will
basically send a lot of their just like
[SPEAKER_10]: things that aren't really qualified for
our markets to their local markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they just get sold really cheaply
at like local markets.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's that type of thing happening
where there's a value in the kind of waste
[SPEAKER_10]: products for large scale producers.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then there's also I think kind of a
smaller scale type farming that also
[SPEAKER_10]: exists where there's still small farms
that are supplying again kind of your
[SPEAKER_10]: local communities.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see a lot of those kind of roadside
stands for watermelons and things and the
[SPEAKER_10]: income is very low there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean they're not making as much money as
the people owning the farm or the people
[SPEAKER_10]: are as we do here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they couldn't even purchase a lot of
the things sometimes in like the fancier
[SPEAKER_10]: supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's kind of a discrepancy there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that I guess is my answer.
[SPEAKER_10]: The large scale producers to a degree are
supplying the local markets with their
[SPEAKER_10]: waste products and otherwise it's just
kind of self-sufficient like a subset of
[SPEAKER_10]: that agriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any invasive species particular
to Chile that are threatening producers
[SPEAKER_02]: right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Producers?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry the question was is there any
invasive species that are threatening
[SPEAKER_09]: producers in the agricultural setting or
just in general?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, very many.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Danielines, we saw lots of
Brassica, wild Brassica species.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah that's been trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I took the weed science class here at
Cornell and was a TA in it and when I went
[SPEAKER_10]: to Chile I was surprised to see how many
times I saw species that I learned here in
[SPEAKER_10]: the Northeast and like saw them there and
how many times it was repeated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like that to me is the sign that
there's the same invasive all across the
country.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh we have a question from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in December, January there was a
series of wildfires throughout the area
[SPEAKER_00]: south of Santiago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that impact either your trip or more
plant biodiversity in that area?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sorry the question was with regard
to the wildfires that took relatively
[SPEAKER_09]: large tracts of land out in Chile recently
and it did not affect our trip at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was slightly after our trip that they
occurred and not in the same area that we
[SPEAKER_09]: were planning to visit as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: However there was an article just
circulated on the effect of the wildfires
[SPEAKER_09]: on biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can try to find it again, I'm sorry I
just noted the title of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean it obviously is a major
disturbance to some of these native
[SPEAKER_09]: habitats so you would expect that the
native plants who are also impacted in the
[SPEAKER_09]: biodiversity is impacted as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: However I don't have any estimates on how
or what percentage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how frequently it burns and
whether or not that's sort of a consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: renewal of some things together actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry Geneva if you didn't hear that it
was said that these wildfires are a
[SPEAKER_09]: relatively new occurrence in Chile and so
it is likely to have greater impacts than
[SPEAKER_09]: we might be expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you encounter any species that are
holdovers from Gondwanaland days which now
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd expect to find in Australia?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Proteas, yeah I have a picture of a
protea.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond that, I don't know.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah anything else?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool check out the posters outside and
thank you very much for coming today.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: you you you
