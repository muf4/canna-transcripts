[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so my training is as a plant
systematist and I'm speaking on
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotany and I guess I will just
preface this talk saying I have some
[SPEAKER_05]: credentials in the ethno part of this
since I have an undergraduate degree in
[SPEAKER_05]: anthropology and I crossed over and
through ethnobotany into botany became
[SPEAKER_05]: totally confused by all the plant names
and made a career out of it and later in
[SPEAKER_05]: my career I had some opportunities being
in Oklahoma and collaborating with
[SPEAKER_05]: paleoethnobotanists and other
ethnobotanists to do some research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of serendipity in
research and I really like this project
[SPEAKER_05]: that was very different than other things
I've done and I think it has some merit
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can be the judge of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really focusing on three tribes
which I'll make a case for as being a good
[SPEAKER_05]: window to look at an overall view of
ethnobotany of the southern plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to reconstruct in many
respects traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a difficult task and with each
generation more and more information gets
[SPEAKER_05]: lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very challenging in many respects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just to start off at a general
level, ethnobotany defined is just
[SPEAKER_05]: interactions between cultures and people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants and people, however you want to
define it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Richard Schultes, a lot of you should
be familiar with that name, is often
[SPEAKER_05]: called the father of modern ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is an Oklahoma connection if
you're familiar with Schultes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and this is my shout out to undergrads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Schultes on the end if I can't see
where this thing is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he's on your left.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end of his junior year going
into his senior year at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a three-month senior thesis
research with an anthropologist in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma where he spent time with the
Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time nobody had made any kind
of inventory of plants used by the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they were buffalo hunters.
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot more complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then obviously that led into an
incredible career as somebody who
[SPEAKER_05]: basically defined the field of
ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_05]: He spent 12 years in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're more interested in following up
on this, the classic book by Wade Davis,
[SPEAKER_05]: One River, is a good depiction of that
time spent based on his journals.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of his photographs are in the book
called The Lost Amazon, also put together
[SPEAKER_05]: by Wade Davis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a movie, just the only
cinematic portrayal of Schultes that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: aware of, Embracing a Serpent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a film from Columbia nominated for
Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a very interesting individual and
really significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's get back into the Southern
Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not in the Southern Plains here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's click my heels together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, eco-geographical setting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shaded area from an eco-region
perspective is the South Central semi-arid
[SPEAKER_05]: prairie ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geographers often have a cutoff of the
Central Great Plains and the Southern
[SPEAKER_05]: Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm mostly concerned with the Southern
Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see basically where the
Plains, Apache, the Kiowa, and the
[SPEAKER_05]: Comanche fit in that geographic and
eco-geographical scheme.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's gonna be particularly significant,
unlike many of the tribes represented in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma, the KCA, as they are often
referred to, Kiowa, Comanche, Apache,
[SPEAKER_05]: this was their native territory.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they swamped their territory and other
major changes happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they weren't transported in here like
the Cherokee and other Southeastern
[SPEAKER_05]: tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's look at the cultural
landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we have in here is a little map.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the tribes in red were basically
nomadic hunting and gathering tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they hunted bison, but they did more
than hunt bison.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gathered plant materials and other
natural resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: The agrarian hunting economies are in
blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really in the Southern Plains,
it was really the Kiowa, the Comanche,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see a hatched area taking in
the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas was
[SPEAKER_05]: their original reservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's much too large.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two years later, they shrunk the rez.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you had the small area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 1901, they basically eliminated
the reservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our early images are by George
Catlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see an image of Comanche bison
hunting there, as well as a Kiowa
[SPEAKER_05]: encampment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I maintain, and that's my thesis,
that the KCA are an ideal group to study
[SPEAKER_05]: the Southern Plains ethnobotany for
several years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been geographically contiguous,
really, for a couple hundred years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a similar economic base,
which was basically hunting and gathering.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a close association since
Euro-American contact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actually confederated politically
under the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a cultural, eco-geographic,
and economic strategies, they were very
[SPEAKER_05]: similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was much intermarriage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, these were very disparate tribes
linguistically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to put these in a linguistic context,
each of those tribes, their language is in
[SPEAKER_05]: a different language family.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did they communicate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, many people living in different
parts of the world learn multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: languages, unlike Americans.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of their growing up,
because they have to interact with people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also use sign language quite a bit,
which came in very useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember going on one of my field trips
when I was with a 96-year-old Apache elder
[SPEAKER_05]: who had no hearing, and his son
communicated by sign language.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have a shared cultural heritage.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1700, the Plains Apache were closely
allied with the Kiowa, which they've kept
[SPEAKER_05]: up all these years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a lot of the intermarriages,
particularly between the Kiowa and Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, for decades, the Apache weren't
even known about.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just assumed to be some group of
Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they called them the Kiowa
Apache, and more correctly referred to as
[SPEAKER_05]: the Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a dialect different from some of the
other Apache groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1806, the Kiowa and Comanche made peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1885, they were actually forced to settle.
[SPEAKER_05]: A familiar story in American Indian
history.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1867, they became confederated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like, there's another
tribe in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it became the KCA, reservation in
Canada, the KC.
[SPEAKER_05]: By 1886, the American bison was
functionally extirpated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is significant, because by being
restricted and being basically forced to
[SPEAKER_05]: become ranchers or farmers, which they
were not, their economic base evaporated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one way to destroy a culture is
to destroy its economy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dawes Act was enacted later,
which eliminated a lot of communal lands,
[SPEAKER_05]: which means families were given individual
plots, which left a lot of leftover land,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was then open for settlement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reservation dissolved in 1901.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are very, very significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, if you talk to any of these
groups, I'm not doing it justice and just
[SPEAKER_05]: going over it in such a short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's look at the reservation
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's in red, the outline of the
reservation, which they were in until
[SPEAKER_05]: 1901.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where most of the tribal
peoples that haven't relocated actually
[SPEAKER_05]: are today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where tribal headquarters are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were forced to settle on the
reservation, home territory restricted.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were restricted to family allotments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a dramatic change, particularly when
they weren't farmers or ranchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no bison, and it's a very sad
point in their history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very proud people have to fight for scraps
thrown off the back of a wagon,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And traditional knowledge, of course,
lost in every generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: A familiar, familiar story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at the objectives of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really more of a meta-analysis
where I've taken data and then tried to
[SPEAKER_05]: assemble it and then do different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different analyses with the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, the raw data are plantless
use of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to reconstruct their floristic
and ethnobotanical resources to get that
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of baseline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at their use patterns in a floristic
context and in an ethnobotanical context.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how many plants did they use?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what percentage of the floor?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this compare to other groups,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_05]: And test the hypotheses on recorded versus
potential, economic plant resources,
[SPEAKER_05]: underreporting of economic plant use,
and loss of traditional knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are difficult things to get at,
but it's something that anthropologists,
[SPEAKER_05]: social sciences, and ethnobotanists have
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, in some respects, we're
reconstructing things in scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to get data, and then we try and
make inferences that are consistent with
[SPEAKER_05]: that data and propose hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, the methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Compiling the economic plant data from the
few surveys that are out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: from some direct communication with some
of the tribal members, and other scattered
[SPEAKER_05]: sources in the literature, sometimes
almost anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the trouble with any
meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have different kinds of data,
and you kind of have to standardize it and
[SPEAKER_05]: bring it in and try and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reconstruct floors for the south central
prairie ecoregion, as well as for their
[SPEAKER_05]: reservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of this relied very heavily on
the databases listed at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't underestimate the value of
some of these databases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's invaluable if I could not do this
kind of work otherwise, as most people who
[SPEAKER_05]: use databases and those resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Native American ethnobotany database,
in particular, was very useful for looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at tribal and plant resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, now I was fortunate, and this also
kind of initiated the study, in that there
[SPEAKER_05]: were three important surveys of this
group.
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, the Plains Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll notice Judy Jordan published a book
in 2008.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was instrumental in working with
her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had done her work in the early 1960s,
three summers of intensive field work,
[SPEAKER_05]: and was granted a master's degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her master's thesis was signed out by
people all over the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why this woman did not get a PhD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is a sad story.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, and she lived less than a mile
from where I lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I looked her up.
[SPEAKER_05]: She got her notes together and she
published it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was very pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's Schulte's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So three months going into his senior year
ended up with a critical publication and
[SPEAKER_05]: really the best summary of the plants used
by the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Comanche, a group out of Michigan,
they had a Michigan archaeological summer
[SPEAKER_05]: station there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Volney Jones was the botanist,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those vouchers are at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Schulte's ones are at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Judy Jordan's are at Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into some of the summary of
the data.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was able to pull these data and
quantify it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we look at the Kiowa, we can verify
about 88 species were recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Comanche is much less, 68.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I spent more time looking through
the Michigan vouchers, which were actually
[SPEAKER_05]: not in the Michigan herbarium,
but were in the anthropological
[SPEAKER_05]: collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: And luckily, I was able to identify some
of the vouchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of the vouchers were fragments of
wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did not identify some of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Plains Apache, which actually took
place over three years, had a much greater
[SPEAKER_05]: number.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some lessons there in terms of
field work, in terms of informants,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Judy had multiple informants,
male and female, over multiple summers
[SPEAKER_05]: from different family groups, as opposed
to one or two male informants during a
[SPEAKER_05]: three-month period.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at the totals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was able to look at the species present
in at least one tribe, about 175.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the species recorded for use among all
tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have three ethnobotanical surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 17 of those are reported in all three
tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of these data only appear in one
survey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these are native to the Southern
Plains, 94%, 164.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five were native to North America,
but are found outside the region and are
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly through trading.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were significant plants from the
South.
[SPEAKER_05]: South or West mostly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were also some exotic species,
not native, six species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like this graphic, and other
individuals have as well, because I think
[SPEAKER_05]: it visually portrays the effect of an
obviously related group that shared a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of the same knowledge of their resources
and how little overlap there was from
[SPEAKER_05]: independent research.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of researchers doing
these surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the number of species for the
Kiowa, the Apache, and Comanche.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the 17 that were shared.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can see some are shared
between the Apache and the Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are in surveys in the Comanche and
Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 35 between the Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by portraying it this way, you realize
that a lot of the information really just
[SPEAKER_05]: surfaced in one ethnobotanical survey,
which means a lot of that information,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was probably there, was forgotten by
some of the informants or was not recorded
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's proprietary in the case of
healing plants, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look by category.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lots of things you can do once
you get these kind of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are species used in at least one
tribe out of the 100 in 1975.
[SPEAKER_05]: A large portion of that are edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the major supplement to the
protein source being primarily bison meat,
[SPEAKER_05]: not exclusively.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ritual or medicinal plants, also a major,
major category.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is true in most ethnobotanical
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: A large number, again, used for material
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is quite important as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal care and adornment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It drops off quite a bit, as you might
suspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the many plants had multiple
uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could be edible.
[SPEAKER_05]: A component or a different plant part
could be used medicinally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it could be used materially.
[SPEAKER_05]: So edible plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this category, I'm keeping it with
broad strokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have foodstuffs, beverages,
masticatories, additives, 91 species.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these have underground parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another major proportion, more than half,
used reproductive parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruits, seeds, and 20 species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Staps, stems, leaves, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two common ones, which you're familiar
with as well here, would be Rusclaebra,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is widespread, and Nufar Lutea as
well, which is widespread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Material culture is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't think it is, see how well
you survive out there without not just
[SPEAKER_05]: your iPhone, everything else that we
purchase.
[SPEAKER_05]: Construction materials, dyes, fibers,
resins, miscellaneous products.
[SPEAKER_05]: A major, major category.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fibers, yucca glauca, which is also
multiple use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of that was edible as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The young stems, which are kind of like
asparagus, as well as the blossoms are
[SPEAKER_05]: edible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And roughly dogwood, which is common in
that region, which often produces a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: stems from a crown that are equal
diameter, so they make good adhesives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ritual medicinal plants, many of these
are quite well-known, used such as
[SPEAKER_05]: Echinacea, widely, widely used,
not just in this region.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peyote.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peyote's been in use for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember, the Comanche were part of
the KCA, and they were really widespread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Kiowa, too, but the Comanche
roamed all over from Mexico up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of what they did is take bow
wood and other things, and they would
[SPEAKER_05]: trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they got exposed to Peyote,
introduced it in Oklahoma, so the
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma-based tribes to KCA, as well as
the Cheyenne and Arapaho, were very
[SPEAKER_05]: critical in introducing Peyote and in
development of the Native American Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: White sagebrush, which is also well-known
here, is widely used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal adornment, personal care,
not so many species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Monartifistulosa, this is a mint,
remember, the Lamiaceae, commonly used as
[SPEAKER_05]: a perfume in those hot southern plains
summers, a perfume could be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you walk through this, it's very,
very aromatic with lots of volatile
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Escalbene, this is actually a psychoactive
plant, but a particularly dangerous plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a legume.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a low mint there, like a
peanut.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are very toxic, and it's very
difficult to modulate the amount taken
[SPEAKER_05]: without it being catastrophic,
kind of like gypsum weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cytodes grama budalua, very
interesting in the sense that the secund
[SPEAKER_05]: or the inflorescences on one side of the
stem look very similar to warlands,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was very common as an ornament,
particularly in ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of these had multiple uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of the most common ones would be the
cacti, opuntia, which are abundant in this
[SPEAKER_05]: region.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edible material culture, ritual medicinal,
as well as black walnut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty of black walnuts here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another species of walnut,
too, a small-fruited walnut, microcarpa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edible material culture, ritual medicinal,
multiple uses for these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to go through a couple
plants, and then we'll look at the data
[SPEAKER_05]: from a couple different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the representative plants,
the junipers, and junipers virginiana,
[SPEAKER_05]: people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the structural material for a lot
of teepees and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get away from the rockies,
you don't have lodgepole pine,
[SPEAKER_05]: hence the name lodgepole, but you can use
the cedars.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a western cedar, a limestone,
that pops up, and I'm particularly pleased
[SPEAKER_05]: with this one because I found this out by
really talking to a couple of the elders
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Apache.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they took me to a spot where they had
a different cedar with a different smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously a different terpenoid
composition, and a different colored
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit, the cones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went there, and as soon as I saw it,
I knew it was panchotii, so we were able
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually add that to the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was on a sacred mountain,
so I felt very privileged.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there with the 96-year-old ex-chair
of the tribal council, who couldn't climb
[SPEAKER_05]: the hill, but he wanted to see it one last
time, because he only lived three months
[SPEAKER_05]: after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was the last native speaker for
that dialect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the museum at the University of
Oklahoma has a very active program of
[SPEAKER_05]: recording languages and stories by native
speakers, and so there's quite an audio
[SPEAKER_05]: library for that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a great library because it's a
very strong voice of the champion in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Maine's Apache dialect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because his son, who I knew, knew songs
and knew some plants, but had no idea what
[SPEAKER_05]: the songs meant or what the plants were
used for, so that's a good example of just
[SPEAKER_05]: one generation loss of traditional
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowdark, or if you're from Texas,
bowdark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Osage orange, this is a member of the
Moreci, the Mulberry family.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the preferred wood for bows,
particularly a mixture of the heartwood
[SPEAKER_05]: with the sapwood, that interface.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you split the wood radially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was the preferred bowwood
throughout the Plains region.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walnuts, little one black, the microcarpa
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And very widely used.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they appreciated its beauty as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is arguably one of the most beautiful
native North American woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the Kiowa cradle board.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite spectacular as well as being
functional.
[SPEAKER_05]: White sagebrush, very, very well known,
including in this region.
[SPEAKER_05]: Artemisia ludoviciana.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Plants database map.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you don't have it if you're up in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, widely, widely used.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess Alabama people are missing out
on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't comment on that further.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, Indian breadroot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the last of these I'll show.
[SPEAKER_05]: A very, very critical plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still fairly abundant in the Northern
Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of the Sioux have these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And include them in their ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's getting much more difficult to
find in the Southern Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very important edible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are six plants not native to
North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wormwood, dandelion, watercress,
sweet clover, Johnson grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet they were used quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when plants became introduced and the
native peoples found them, if they knew of
[SPEAKER_05]: a use, that knowledge spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they incorporated into their
repertoire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these have been around a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of these plants used by the KCA were
also used outside of the Southern Plains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, it depends on the natural
distribution of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the KCA plants are going to be
plants found in the North American prairie
[SPEAKER_05]: and the southwestern or Sonoran floristic
provinces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yucca glauca, as you can see,
which is mostly mid-continent,
[SPEAKER_05]: has a mid-continent tribal use pattern.
[SPEAKER_05]: Western soapberry, much more southwestern.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick up the Papyo, as well as the KCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mousse glaver is used by a multitude of
tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reflecting its distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we look in the archaeological
record, and a lot of these records are
[SPEAKER_05]: come from the flotation method,
a lot of these are charcoalified.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have 75 plants from the Great Plains
in the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those who may not be familiar,
it's generally divided into the
[SPEAKER_05]: Paleoindian, basically 10,000 years and
older, the Archaic period to about 1,000
[SPEAKER_05]: BCE, woodland, and then the Plains village
merging into the modern.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's your scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at some of the KCA species
that are in the archaeological record,
[SPEAKER_05]: most of these data are by genus only.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very difficult to identify a lot of
species that are charcoalified.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 47 appear in the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we go back in time, Plains village,
woodland, Archaic Paleo, you can see you
[SPEAKER_05]: drop off the number of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's five plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still used that have been in use for much
greater than 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that's interesting is
there's several species in the record that
[SPEAKER_05]: don't show up in the KCA record.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we look at goosefoot, Kena podium,
that is a KCA plant, carbonized.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sumpweed in the sunflower family,
Iva annua, very widespread throughout its
[SPEAKER_05]: range.
[SPEAKER_05]: Historically, in the Paleoethnobotanical
record, no record for the KCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's true for many cultures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that once corn came in,
they dropped a lot of these grains that
[SPEAKER_05]: were more like famine food.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the five plants that have a
greater than 10,000 year record,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I find pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goosefoot, chokecherry, soralsia,
which you may not be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_05]: member of the mallow family, sunflower,
as well as the pointilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we summarize the botany in an
ethnographic context, we'll see that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a wide variety of plants used.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot more than just bison,
monolithic bison hunters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the plants used are used by
other tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a lot of communication,
shared knowledge, which has good survival
[SPEAKER_05]: value in different ways and makes perfect
sociological sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a long history of usage for many
of these plants, thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the region, even with the ebb and flow
of different cultural groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm proposing that the combined data,
particularly given the nature of
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotanical surveys, resulted in a much
more complete view of the plants used by
[SPEAKER_05]: the individual tribes, and probably is a
more accurate reflection of their
[SPEAKER_05]: collective knowledge base of plant
resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course, once you get this,
there's a lot of other questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many plants did they use?
[SPEAKER_05]: How thorough are some of these surveys?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kind of partially answered that
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the real tricky one, how can we
estimate loss of traditional knowledge,
[SPEAKER_05]: other than saying traditional knowledge is
lost in each generation, which it
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously is, but it's difficult to kind
of quantify some of these or get a more
[SPEAKER_05]: robust hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I reconstructed the floor of the KCA
Res.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where the databases come in and
came up with 1,289 species for this
[SPEAKER_05]: seven-county region in southwestern
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mostly concerned with the natives,
so that's a fair number.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also went in, which was a lot more
challenging, and tried to reconstruct the
[SPEAKER_05]: native floor of the southern,
south-central Great Plains ecoregion.
[SPEAKER_05]: The floor of the Great Plains was of
limited use because of the region that it
[SPEAKER_05]: covers and incorporates the northern
plains as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I came up with 28 and 39 native species
there, 1,289 native species for the Res.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then looking at those reservation
plants with economic uses elsewhere in
[SPEAKER_05]: North America, 508 are recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So almost two out of five plants on that
reservation had some documented history of
[SPEAKER_05]: use by Native Americans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two out of five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there's a lot of grass species in
there, a lot of legume species,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of asteracea species, but two out of
five were useful, and that's pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, not all of those were used,
but that's the potential resource.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the south-central plains,
you see a much smaller percentage,
[SPEAKER_05]: about 6%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure the numbers were much larger,
but with their range restriction,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of that extra reservation floor was
probably forgotten.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they used 164 native plants that I can
document out of 1,289, and that's 12.7%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that's the figure that's actually
very similar to well-documented
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotanical surveys elsewhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard to get that kind of data
because of the tribal, whatever group
[SPEAKER_05]: you're studying is part of a larger
region, and they don't just have a floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest example would be a Pacific
island, where you have a discrete floor
[SPEAKER_05]: and a discrete culture, and you can look
at a percentage of that floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're getting pretty close to what
other people have recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, there's only one-third of the
plants, 164 out of 508, that are actually
[SPEAKER_05]: used or at least recorded for use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, potential economic species,
almost 40%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actual, if we combine the data from KCA,
you see we get at 12.7%, which actually
[SPEAKER_05]: most ethnobotanists feel comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we just looked at individual
surveys, you can see the numbers,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're much reduced, 6.4, 4.7,
7.8.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the close ties, again,
going back to my original argument,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're getting closer to having an
accurate reconstruction of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotanical base.
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting to the summaries, key points of
the use patterns, about 12.7%,
[SPEAKER_05]: almost 13%.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually very similar to the floor
of South Africa totals, where they've
[SPEAKER_05]: looked at how many plants were used based
on the floor as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, there's many, many
different regions in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the RSA.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have, people have, they sound like
Donald Trump up here, talking to
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotanists who have done field work,
somewhere around 10% is often a number.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the number that they come up with,
in terms of a ballpark percentage of the
[SPEAKER_05]: floor that's actually used.
[SPEAKER_05]: But only one third of the negative plants,
or potential useful plants, are actually
[SPEAKER_05]: used.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 40% of those have been used by some
groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting to the conclusions,
what kind of evidence do we have for loss
[SPEAKER_05]: of traditional knowledge?
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we do the best we can with
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Low usage of economic plants within the
floor of their historic range.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other factors complicating
these, but that's certainly a contributing
[SPEAKER_05]: factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 30% of the species recorded for use
of potential plants are actually used.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's most undoubtedly an underestimate
what we're coming up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, like in any culture,
transcultural dispersal of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_05]: resource use is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at the spread of corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need an example, 30% of the exotic
floor is used economically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then many KCA plants were widely used
among other tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was obviously much communication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Melalotis, a widely used exotic yellow
sweet clover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second conclusion slide, evidence for
underreporting of ethnobotanical data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this may be some of the more
significant results of interest
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotanies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get very low numbers on these
individual surveys compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: comparators.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we pull it, we actually get a
much more reasonable number.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's definite underreporting
in some of these surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited overlap among tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This gets into ethnographic sampling
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't go in and talk to one
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine if you were interviewed and say,
tell me everything about America.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a very biased and
minimalist subset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, many regional economic species
listed are not recorded, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of almost end here with this
picture of Schultes again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Undergrads, you never know where your
undergraduate projects are going to take
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Schultes signed up for a summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can write my senior thesis on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: His entire career, and it really changed
the landscape of science in several
[SPEAKER_05]: disciplines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there he was, probably 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the morning after a peyote ritual.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll notice he still has his tie on.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been described as patrician.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he didn't wear a tie on the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: For acknowledgments, certainly I want to
acknowledge the KCA tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their knowledge and the interactions
I've had with them and some of their
[SPEAKER_05]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been very happy to see this data.
[SPEAKER_05]: It resurrected Judy Jordan, who wrote that
book.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually been given an honorific
title within the Plains Apache tribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she brought plants to their attention
that they forgot about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way back there in the cultural
knowledge somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will McClatchy used to be in Hawaii,
then Brit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's independent in the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Helped quite a bit with some of my
floristic ethnobotanical analyses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some colleagues at Oklahoma, Paul Minnis,
a paleoethnobotanist that only likes his
[SPEAKER_05]: plants charcolified.
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume that's not true for the Hort
department and a couple of grad students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Moorman, who put together that
incredible database and has been very
[SPEAKER_05]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's retired now, but he still keeps the
database active.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint Flannery, who oversees the anthro
collections at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these people were very helpful in
putting this together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd be happy to answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any of these tribes cultivating
any of these plants as opposed to simply
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering them from the wild?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question was about, were any of
these wild plants actually cultivated?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were immobile people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, and so they really
took careful stock of their resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes they almost followed a
route.
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of knew where some of the plants
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very possible they did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, if we look at some examples,
it's very common in some cultures for
[SPEAKER_05]: people, particularly like Coolander's or
whatever, to transplant plants into a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that may have happened,
particularly if there was a route in their
[SPEAKER_05]: cyclic mobility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they could come back and do where
certain plants were.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's likely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have no direct evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a real issue with something
like sumpweed, which is really widespread
[SPEAKER_05]: in the archaeological record.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not reported among many extant
tribes at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they just dropped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet it appears in such numbers,
an archaeological record, to make it seem
[SPEAKER_05]: like they were actually, it was like an
incipient cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, individuals are actually trying
to redevelop sumpweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not eaten it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't have any direct evidence of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to ethnobotanical surveys,
did any of the researchers, including
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, look at cultural works,
such as creation stories, for mentions of
[SPEAKER_00]: significance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is about whether
researchers have also looked into creation
[SPEAKER_05]: stories, or that would incorporate some of
these significant plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have not directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are several good ethnographic books
and investigations of the KCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have not come across that in some of
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to peruse a lot of that
literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these, even if they're
referenced in the native language,
[SPEAKER_05]: that language has at least an English
equivalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd have to ask some of my
anthropological colleagues for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a member of the Kiowa
tribe on the OU anthropology faculty,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: They teach Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can do your language
requirement learning Kiowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm not aware of any.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wayne, if you look across the range from
the plants that are best known to show up
[SPEAKER_02]: the most,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that axis about the commonality of the
plants, or are certain types of uses more
[SPEAKER_02]: likely to be showing up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, OK, so the question was plants that
are commonly recurring, whether it
[SPEAKER_05]: reflects more that they're very common,
or they have a culturally significant use.
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer seems to be more towards the
significance and component, if something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of plants that may
be part of the knowledge base,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they may be less desirable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like food.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always going to be preferred food,
less preferred food, and then famine food.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nevertheless, the plants that really,
I mean, there's like a dirty dozen many
[SPEAKER_05]: times, that just keep appearing in all
these surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because they are so critically
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And corcus is one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in the peyote ceremony,
they use corcus leaves, the smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: so the question is about some of the
naming used by the different tribes,
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly given the fact that they
speak languages in three different
[SPEAKER_05]: families.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I have not really looked into
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the way I approach this topic,
as you might guess, is as a botanist doing
[SPEAKER_05]: ethnobotany, as opposed to an ethnographer
doing ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have not looked into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have the names, and there are
experts and even tribal members that are
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar with the language that one could
test that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be very interesting to look
at.
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, I have not pursued that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take me a time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Geneva have questions?
Bill?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how many families are there
represented among these plants that they
[SPEAKER_03]: commonly not only come?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't include that kind of
information, not on this talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to go into my data archive in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's quite a large number in my primary
database.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all organized taxonomically by
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's at least 65 families, and that may
be an underestimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, things like roseaceae are very
common, and things like fabaceae are very
[SPEAKER_05]: common.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are no seeds, legume seeds,
that were used.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there weren't any grass seeds that I
recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: I expected drop seed, sporopolis or
something like that to pop up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they've appeared in other surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think those are areas where some
knowledge has been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at genera, would there be more
sharing of genera among the three tribes
[SPEAKER_03]: than of species?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of my numbers are going down to
the species level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes, it depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because different species are often
referred to as a cousin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a cousin of another prunus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some information that there's
a little bit of error in that data,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the sense that they often did not
discriminate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the genus, and that's an interesting
point that you alluded to or directly
[SPEAKER_05]: alluded to.
[SPEAKER_05]: The genus is actually a very, very
critical element.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of non-Western taxonomies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But depending on the plant, this species
can be important as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank Professor Ellison for a
fascinating presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
