[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me welcome you to the Plant Biology
section seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my great pleasure to introduce this
morning's speaker, Professor Keith Dunker,
[SPEAKER_03]: who has a remarkably distinguished
academic background.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got his undergraduate degree in
chemistry from the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: California, Berkeley, and he received his
master's and PhD in physics and biophysics
[SPEAKER_03]: from the University of Wisconsin,
Madison.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also did a postdoctoral period at Yale
University in structural biology and
[SPEAKER_03]: molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keith is currently professor of
biochemistry and molecular biology in the
[SPEAKER_03]: School of Medicine in Indiana University,
and he also is the leader of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioinformatics Group in the School of
Informatics and Computing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amongst his many academic accolades,
he is a highly cited researcher,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to the Thomson-Retger Survey in
biology and biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: To date, he has over 32,000 citations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good record.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a personal note, I will say that Keith
and I met on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an email from Keith asking me about
the evolution of multicellularity,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we got engaged in a conversation about
intrinsically disordered proteins and
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative splicing, and lo and behold,
the lights turned on, and we got into a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation about evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has continued over, I'm very pleased
to say, a warm and deep friendship.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've even published a few papers
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, let me introduce
Professor Dunker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I want to thank Carl for
inviting me here, and I want to thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys for showing up, and I won't be upset
if you leave halfway through, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have other better things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got started on this study of
disordered proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we did really was to build
a predictor of disordered proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was done in collaboration with
Zoran Obradovich, a professor of computer
[SPEAKER_00]: science, and Pedro Romero, his student at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just standard method for
developing a predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You collect some structured data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use order and structure
interchangeably, and some disordered
[SPEAKER_00]: protein data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You figure out what's different between
what features in the sequence are
[SPEAKER_00]: different between structure and disorder,
and four of the major ones we found were
[SPEAKER_00]: the very different content of aromatic
amino acids, a very different hydropathy
[SPEAKER_00]: Structured proteins are much more
hydrophobic than disordered proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that disordered proteins tended
to have a net charge, and if you have too
[SPEAKER_00]: much of one charge, you'll get charge
repulsion as the protein tends to fold,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there'll be a resistance to folding by
having a net charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, sequence complexity,
which is one measure is just simply the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different amino acids in a
window another measure is Shannon's
[SPEAKER_00]: entropy over some window, and structured
proteins tend to have a greater variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids, and they therefore have a
higher sequence complexity, a higher value
[SPEAKER_00]: for Shannon's entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these and other attributes can be used
then to predict whether a region of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein is structured or disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, of course, you separate the
training and testing sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You train the predictor, and we've done a
whole bunch of different models,
[SPEAKER_00]: neural networks, support vector machines,
logistic regression, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction models we've used through the
expertise of my collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoran Abradovich and his student,
Pedro Romero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you train the predictor,
and then you validate how well the
[SPEAKER_00]: predictor does on sample that was on data
that was not used for training,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you carry out testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prediction on various biological
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a balanced accuracy that is
accuracy of prediction on structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder averaged of about 70 to 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strongly depends on the data set
you're using, both to train the predictor
[SPEAKER_00]: and to see how well you're doing with the
predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's something called an area
under the curve and somewhere around .85,
[SPEAKER_00]: .86.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tells you about this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plot the true positive prediction
rate versus the false positive prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, you can get an estimate of how good
your predictor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very strong, but anyway,
a perfect predictor would go up here to
[SPEAKER_00]: one and go over there, and you would have
an area under the curve of one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a random predictor would go from one
corner to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would do a diagonal, and that would
give you an area under the curve of about
[SPEAKER_00]: .5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a predictor of this one is not
ours, but it was a very good one at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of about .89.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours tend to be around .8786, somewhere in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by balanced accuracy, we mean percent
correct on structure, percent correct on
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, divide them by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for using balanced accuracy
is that most of the data sets that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: using would have 80% of their residues
would be in structure and 20% would be in
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just use straight accuracy,
you could predict structure all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and be 80% accurate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to balance it out because of
the imbalanced data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so anyway, this is what we did to
start our work on these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea of what the
results look like, here's a protein P53,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very famous as a tumor
suppressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a transcription factor, and we see up
is predicted to be disordered,
[SPEAKER_00]: down is predicted to be structured,
and .5 is the boundary line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this protein, what we see is a
long prediction of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go to the protein data bank,
we in fact can find this protein
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's bound to DNA, and this is in
fact the DNA binding domain of P53.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's bound to four different
protein partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure remains basically the same
when it's bound to all four partners,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different partners accommodate
different regions of this structured
[SPEAKER_00]: protein to which they bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and this is a common story that we
can repeat for hundreds of proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we predict a long region of
structure, and in the protein data bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find a globular protein or domain
that fits our prediction of disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get it perfectly right at the
ends, but it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we predict disorder,
and what we often find in the protein data
[SPEAKER_00]: bank is correlated with our prediction of
disorder are segments that become
[SPEAKER_00]: structured when they bind to different
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at this same region of disorder
prediction, and incidentally this disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction has been verified by NMR and
other methods as being actually disordered
[SPEAKER_00]: in this protein, but our predictions of
disorder, we see that the same segment can
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to different protein partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and we'll come back to this in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of you have seen these high
throughput studies of protein-protein
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction networks, where there'll be
some proteins that are called hubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these hub proteins will bind to many,
many, many different protein partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've investigated a bunch of these hubs,
and they're using disorder and its
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility to be able to bind to the
multiple protein partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hub proteins are almost universally
using disorder to be able to bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple partners, and they do that using
their flexibility, and we will come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that point again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what got me started on all of the study
of disorder proteins was a seminar that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna tell you about, and the seminar
dealt with the signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is in fact, think of this as
being from a T cell, an immune cell in
[SPEAKER_00]: mammals and others, and you get some
stimulation of a receptor on the T cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what happens is calcium levels go up,
calcium binds to a protein called
[SPEAKER_00]: calmodulin over here, and calmodulin then
interacts with a protein called
[SPEAKER_00]: calcineurin, and that interaction
activates calcineurin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcineurin, it turns out, is a serine
threonine phosphatase, so it clips a
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate off of another protein called
N-fat, and N-fat stands for nuclear factor
[SPEAKER_00]: of activated T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the phosphate gets clipped off,
N-fat, the dephosphorylated form,
[SPEAKER_00]: then goes into the nucleus, and it turns
out that, we'll see in a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: that N-fat doesn't have one phosphate
sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has multiple phosphates in a
long IDP tail, intrinsically disordered
[SPEAKER_00]: protein tail, and it actually cleaves off
multiple phosphates, then N-fat can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the nucleus, and there it turns on
multiple genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-fat itself, turns out, is a
transcription factor, and the T cells
[SPEAKER_00]: become activated, and then this protein is
important medically because it leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: things like transplant rejection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a transplanted heart or a
transplanted kidney, it gets rejected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the recognition by these T cells that it's
a foreign tissue, and over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it points out that either cyclosporin A or
FK506, they actually interact with their
[SPEAKER_00]: binding proteins, and then they can
interact with calcineurin and block its
[SPEAKER_00]: activity that blocks this activity,
that blocks the turning on of the various
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that activate the T cell and then
lead to tissue rejection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure was being presented by
Kissinger, who was the presenter of this
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incidentally, I'm going to leave this talk
here with my host, Karl Nicklaus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and anybody who wants copies of this talk
can contact him, and maybe it'll even be
[SPEAKER_00]: put up on a website locally, and so if you
want to pull references off of this talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is full of references, feel free to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Kissinger was telling us about
this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the crystal structure that he
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it has what's called an
autoinhibitory domain, and what happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: that what you don't see in the crystal
structure is about a 95 residue region of
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, so-called by the
crystallographers, when a region of a
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal structure, when a region of the
protein sequence is missing, and so this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a region of missing electron density,
and here indicates that in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: containing this autoinhibitory peptide or
domain within the disordered region,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a second region, which is bound by
calmodulin, and this calmodulin binding
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow causes this autoinhibitory peptide
to come off, and then the phosphatase
[SPEAKER_00]: active site is turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our disorder prediction applied
to the NFAT, and these are two different
[SPEAKER_00]: predictors, and they give a lot of
variation in their output, but they agree
[SPEAKER_00]: generally that this region is structured,
and in fact, like what we've already seen
[SPEAKER_00]: for P53, this turns out to be a structured
domain here, this turns out to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: disordered connector, and this turns out
to be a second structured domain here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these two both bind to the particular
recognition sites on DNA, and then this
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder tail and this disorder tail bind
to a variety of protein partners to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate this thing, so we see this is a
DNA binding domain, a transactivation
[SPEAKER_00]: domain, another transactivation domain
here, and then here's the nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: localization signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue site, the blue residues are
arginines and lysines, and they are the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal that is recognized by the kaotropin
that carries it across the nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane to get it into the nucleus,
and then these red serines become
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated, and so you have the
positively charged nuclear localization
[SPEAKER_00]: signal and that's inactivated by adding
the phosphates to these serines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that blocks the nuclear localization
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to summarize what we're finding
here is that here are these two proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcineurin and NFAT.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two key proteins in the T cell
regulatory pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both use IDP regions for signal
transductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IDP regions in both calcineurin and
NFAT contain short signaling segments,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nuclear localization signal in NFAT and
an autoinhibitory domain and a calmodulin
[SPEAKER_00]: binding site region in the calcineurin's
region, and the NFAT's nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: localization signal is turned off by
phosphorylation and is turned on by
[SPEAKER_00]: dephosphorylation, so phosphorylation
regulates the NFAT signaling, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the NFAT's 140 residue IDP region,
region of missing electron density,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a folded domain that is
connected by a flexible link or so it
[SPEAKER_00]: wobbles, and so that's why you don't see
it in the X-ray diffraction analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you, X-ray diffraction depends
on having identical structures replicated
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting the diffraction from those
identical structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wobbling or moving around,
then the spacing changes and then it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the final structure that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could, the missing electron density
could either be a wobbly domain or it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a long disordered region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, calcium calmodulin surrounds a
significant part, as we showed earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that suggests it's a localized
region that's moving around rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: large domain that's a structured domain
and wobbling or moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcineurin molecule, if you add a
little bit of trypsin, it gets rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: digested at multiple locations and that
rapid digestion is inhibited or prevented
[SPEAKER_00]: by binding calcium calmodulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that suggests that the calcium
calmodulin binding site is in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting it from digestion, which is
further evidence that this is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: long disordered region, not a wobbly
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finally, the key points about this,
again, is that the IDP functions as an
[SPEAKER_00]: on-off switch for calcineurin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's activated by calcium calmodulin and
such activation is a well-known mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least 40 different eukaryotic
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryotic proteins are regulated by this
calcium calmodulin activation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcineurin is a phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorylation, dephosphorylation is
one of the most widely used signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been estimated that something like
70% of eukaryotic proteins are regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: by phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have this calcineurin's IDP
region that sits at the nexus or at the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection of two very, very important
signaling pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I attended this seminar where all
of this was presented, it just seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and in my own research, I encountered
intrinsically disordered protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just seemed to me that this was an
extremely important protein mechanism for
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling and regulation, just because of
these two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcineurin, calmodulin was important,
and then the NFAT, the disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after the seminar, this was on
November 15th, 1995, we asked three
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they fold?
[SPEAKER_00]: How common are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the functions of IDPs and IDP
regions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from 97 to present, we published on
the order of 200 papers that provide
[SPEAKER_00]: answers to these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna go through all three of
them, but I'm gonna focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional aspects of IDPs and IDP
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about 10 years after this seminar
by Kissinger, we collected, we wanted to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we studied a large number of individual
examples of IDPs and how they regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: protein function, and what we show you for
calcineurin and what we show you for NFAT
[SPEAKER_00]: are examples of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to do something more global,
so we collected the proteins from Swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of thousands,
I think right now Swiss protein is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: several hundred thousand proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each protein in the Swiss protein
database has functional information about
[SPEAKER_00]: that protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about the Swiss proteins
is that they've actually been isolated and
[SPEAKER_00]: studied in laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not guessed proteins from sequence
analysis or from genetic analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've actually been isolated and
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we collected function-specific
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could collect all the proteins
that have been identified as kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could collect all the proteins that
have been identified as being involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could collect all the proteins
involved in some other functional
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have function-specific sequences,
and then for a function-specific set,
[SPEAKER_00]: we collected a thousand matching but
random function sets of sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by matching, we mean that for the
function-specific set, this random
[SPEAKER_00]: function set matches in terms of the size
of the proteins and the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: chains in this matching random function
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we predict disorder for each
function-specific set and for the thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: random function sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it turned out the random function set,
if we use a measure like total predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder per chain, then we could compare
the random function sets over the thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: random function sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variation really approximates a
Gaussian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so given that, we can use the z-score
in the function-specific sets to rank them
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the amount of predicted
disorder, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you use the standard z-score,
the value of the set minus the average
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by the standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we centered these Gaussians on
zero, and negative values indicates more
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, and positive values indicates
more disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's look first at the high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high level functions assume associated
with less prediction of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for p-values, I'll get to that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall data at the time we did
this gave us, for low prediction of
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, for p-values in .05,
there were 302 such examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intermediate values minus .05 to .95,
there were 170.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for high prediction of disorder,
where the p-values were greater than .95,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not like a Gaussian, these
individual areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're bimodal, with lots of them
predicted to be structured, lots of them
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted to be disordered, and very few
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relatively few in the middle,
for a total of 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's the references for these
papers if you want to go read the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at the proteins with a
low prediction of disorder, if we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the high level biological processes most
strongly associated with low prediction of
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder, then it's what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthesis, biosynthesis, transport,
transport, biosynthesis, catabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: glycolysis, biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, these are either transmembrane
proteins for electron transport or
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane transport, or these are proteins
associated with biosynthesis or
[SPEAKER_00]: catabolism, or glycolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all processes that are dominated
by enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know enzymes are structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crystallize them, we get their
three-dimensional structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that catalysts, for example,
have to have a site that can stabilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition state of a chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are theoretical arguments that these
sites have to be structured to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the transition state,
and all of that has to be very precise,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you need structure to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at these z-scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really pretty astoundingly large
z-scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if you look at the
processes most strongly associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the high prediction of disorder,
what are these biological processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are processes dominated by signaling
and regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Differentiation, transcription,
transcription regulation, spermatogenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA condensation, cell cycle regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of biological
processes that have associated proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: that are extremely rich in predicted
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our current biochemistry training
of our students focuses on the structured
[SPEAKER_00]: protein set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it focuses on catalysis, it focuses on
membrane transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you go farther down the list,
you get to proteins that bind to small
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like myoglobin, hemoglobin,
these kinds of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really makes up the predominance
of what we teach our students about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I meet people today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meet many people today that still have
never heard of disordered proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never encountered disordered
proteins because they're studying the
[SPEAKER_00]: structured side of the protein universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, these disordered
proteins, you have sequence to IDP
[SPEAKER_00]: ensemble, intrinsically disordered protein
ensemble, to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're involved in signaling and
regulation recognition control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example I started with, calcineurin,
had a piece in a disordered region that
[SPEAKER_00]: bound to the active site of the protein
and shut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regulating the enzymatic function of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we, for example, take an enzyme that
exists in prokaryotes and an enzyme that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that same enzyme that has evolved and now
in eukaryotes, what we typically find,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're in the process of looking at
across whole genomes to study what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell you now, but we found
specific examples where the prokaryotic
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme is an enzyme and it's there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does its enzymatic function.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the same enzyme and
eukaryotic eukaryotes, it will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sequence will be longer and it will
have extra disordered regions that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been added that are regulating that
enzymatic function when you get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that story multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to study differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out at the top of our list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a biological function associated with
proteins that have a lot of predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder or much more predicted disorder
than the proteins on the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: list that have much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we selected some proteins that are
specifically involved with cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One collection contains sites for binding
to DNA and for regulating DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcription these so-called
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found proteins that bind to other
proteins and that are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating partner function.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be proteins involved in
pathways that are used for cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation pathways, such as the wind
pathway, such as the notch pathway and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: IDPs contain sites for post-translation or
modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these often regulate one in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, many proteins contain,
especially from the multicellular
[SPEAKER_00]: organism, they contain insertions and
deletions or indels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these insertions and deletions arise
from alternative splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are commonly involved in
modulating both one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either DNA or protein things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can add or subtract segments
that are involved in one, two,
[SPEAKER_00]: or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk very briefly about
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few eukaryotic transcription factors
have been known since the 1980s to contain
[SPEAKER_00]: IDP regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bioinformatics studies, too,
came out in 2006 showing that nearly all
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic transcription factors are
really rich in disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: A typical eukaryotic transcription factor
will have 70 percent of its amino acids in
[SPEAKER_00]: disordered regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, we're going to talk for
a minute about hox transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are found from jellyfish to
mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they regulate gene expression for body
plan development.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the one I'll talk about has been
studied by one of my collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah Bondos, who's at Texas A&M
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she studies a particular one called
ultrabithorax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fruit fly transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it regulates this central region of
the fruit fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has been long known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know most of the known direct gene
targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regulates different genes in different
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can activate or repress the same gene
in different tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: UBX actually collaborates with another hox
protein called extradonical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they collaborate to turn on certain
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UBX and extradonical have counterparts
in human, whose names I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this crystal structure was presented
in this paper in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is you have helix in
extradonical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a similar helix in UBX that bind,
here you have a better view of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that bind into a major groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, beyond this helix, it has a chain
which is disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this YPWM motif that brings a
linkage between the extradonical and the
[SPEAKER_00]: UBX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And links them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this IDP linker enables a
collaboration for the gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it turns out that this IDP region
actually becomes structured at least over
[SPEAKER_00]: part of its length when it binds into the
minor groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been observed over and over
for gene regulatory transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they'll have a binding site that
will have a helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The helix will bind to the major groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also have a piece of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the piece of disorder will bind into
the minor groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really commonly observed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's interesting that the YPWM motif
can actually self-bind back onto UBX when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not bound to extradonical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it does that, the IDP loop is
masking this binding helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually greatly reduces the UBX
binding affinity for DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IDP region, and this is a work by
Sarah Bondos, acts as a regulator of DNA
binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA binding of UBX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we've taken the UBX sequence,
predicted disorder, and color coded that
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder as red for disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see these large red spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prediction of structure is not
very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so blue and white is sort of
intermediate between order and disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue is indicating prediction of
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this YPMW motif is one of the most
strongly structured predicted regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: structure in this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the prediction for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't go into this much further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the common eukaryotic transcription
factor will have a region predicted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: modestly structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be DNA binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have other regions that are
predicted to be disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will regulate the binding to the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's not a bad summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about protein-protein
interactions for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I presented this as an example of
what you get when you're when you predict
[SPEAKER_00]: on a protein and you predict regions of
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here I want to go into more detail
about this little segment of disorder that
[SPEAKER_00]: binds to four different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the sequence blown up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it binds to this particular protein
partner, sirtuin, it becomes a beta sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it binds to this region, when it
binds to this other protein here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes an alpha helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it binds to this protein,
it becomes a random coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it binds to this protein,
it becomes a random coil with a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet all of these map back to the same
region of sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this emphasizes one of the strengths
of disordered region in terms of signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same disordered region can
adopt a different structure and thereby
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to a different protein partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can change its shape to fit onto the
surface of different structured protein
[SPEAKER_00]: partners.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we look in more detail at these
interactions, we can look at the buried
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area residue by residue in this
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at this overall pattern of
burial, you see the pattern is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see kind of a helical
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see up and down, up and down as it
as it goes around in the helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain residues become more buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other residues are not buried at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're projecting out into the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out into the solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see different burial patterns
of when it's a helix, when it's a sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's a random coil, when it's a
random coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these two particular residues in this
partner and this partner show abnormally
[SPEAKER_00]: large buried surface areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This turns out to be a lysine in these two
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lysine, you know, has very little
burial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much burial here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a large change in burial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this lysine becomes acetylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you remove the positive charge and
that lysine becomes deeply buried in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity on these two surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we go through the protein data bank
and we look for the same piece of disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: being bound to different partners,
we often find that that's modulated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: PTM switch with binding to one partner
with a protein post-translational
[SPEAKER_00]: modification binding to a different
partner without that post-translational
[SPEAKER_00]: modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often know that post-translational
modifications occur in disordered regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that post-translational
modifications can regulate which partner a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein binds to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that coupling of disorder and PTMs
can act as a switch of binding to one
[SPEAKER_00]: protein partner versus binding to another
protein partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know DNA binding can be affected,
DNA binding by IDPs where you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: region of disorder that binds to minor
groove that's also often modulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: PTMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't show data, but there are some
beautiful papers showing that as you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the amount of phosphorylation,
the affinity almost acts as a real stat
[SPEAKER_00]: from tight binding with no phosphorylation
to the tight binding to DNA with no
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation to no binding at all with
high phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can adjust that by the number of
phosphorylations that you introduce into
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is more about the phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect eukaryotic proteins with known
sites of serine or threonine or
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation P sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect the nonphosphorylated or NP sites
from the same proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the context of the P sites versus
the NP sites for the nonphosphorylated
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that phosphocytes
really look like, those regions really
[SPEAKER_00]: look like IDP regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that are not phosphorylated
look like, much more often like structured
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we published this paper in 04.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got together with some computer
scientists and did a followup site where
[SPEAKER_00]: we made a much more complicated predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that if we look at homo
sapiens, the sites that get phosphorylated
[SPEAKER_00]: are strongly, are much more predicted to
be disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's around 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few phosphorylation sites in regions
predicted to be structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, prediction value is less than
0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the phosphorylation sites are
in regions predicted to be structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the nonphosphorylated sites,
they have disorder predictions all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much of them are in the structure
predicted range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for homo sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a very, very similar result for
thaliana, for arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same sort of pattern and so on,
and a similar but more complicated pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: for phosphorylation sites on tyrosine in
homo sapiens for nonphosphorylated versus
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not quite as dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it turns out that many proteins,
how am I doing for time?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time am I supposed to end?
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.15?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably go over a few minutes,
but too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to leave, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many proteins have clusters of PTMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting about these
clusters of post-translational
[SPEAKER_00]: modification is that different patterns of
post-translational modification will give
[SPEAKER_00]: different downstream signaling
consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so David Alice has called this a
histone code because the histone tails
[SPEAKER_00]: have different sets of PTMs leading to
different downstream consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yang from McGill has called this a
molecular barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: These folks have called it a PTM code.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys called it combinatorial PTMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that this has been
observed for lots of different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, meaning Petr Rejovich and his
student, Vikas Peshavar, studied these PTM
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters in large numbers of proteins,
and they did bioinformatics extensions
[SPEAKER_00]: that suggest that PTMs and PTM clusters in
IDP regions are really common over
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that PTM codes are almost certainly
very widely used for modulating cell
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these PTMs, these multiple PTMs,
very high fraction of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: occur in IDP regions, and they're used
broadly for signaling for regular
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now the third leg of this whole
access is that alternative splicing of
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-messenger RNA will give you two
different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: One with extra piece of protein that came
about from alternatively spliced messenger
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pieces of protein that are
actually added or taken away by means of
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative splicing, they're mostly
regions of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's data supporting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had experimentally determined 46
proteins with 75 alternatively spliced
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then these are the alternatively
spliced data sets and then here is our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions on this data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is experiment in terms of zero to
20% predicted disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the frequency of occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the prediction, data prediction,
20 to 40, data prediction, 40 to 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: data prediction, 60 to 80, data
prediction, 80 to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's only 46 proteins,
75 alternatively spliced regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we collected data from Swiss protein,
558 proteins, 1,200 alternatively spliced
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's prediction, prediction,
prediction, prediction, prediction,
[SPEAKER_00]: very much like a prediction on the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here is this was in the published
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later we went back and got 15,000
with Swiss protein became enlarged,
[SPEAKER_00]: 32,000 alternatively spliced regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our predictions for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These data suggest and the statistics
indicate that we can reject the null
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis with certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The null hypothesis being that it's
equally likely for an alternative spliced
[SPEAKER_00]: region to code for structure and disorder
and we can strongly reject that null
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these data strongly suggest that
alternatively spliced regions of messenger
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA are strongly coding for disordered
regions of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now what's the implication of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take a protein like BRCA1,
it has a structured domain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A structured domain is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's color coded prediction of disorder,
prediction of structure, prediction of
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pull down experimental experiments
show that this disordered region binds to
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have BRCA1 at the center of all
of these interactions including DNA in
[SPEAKER_00]: here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's, oh, DNA is yellow so there's a DNA
binding, DNA binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the DNA and proteins, here's what the
network, so it's obviously a hub with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a small sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds to hundreds of more proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we have alternative splicing,
it splices out this segment, the network
[SPEAKER_00]: gets changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another splice variant that is
known to exist in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people in this area suggest that
alternative splicing leads to a rewiring
[SPEAKER_00]: of protein interaction networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads to a rewiring of protein DNA
interaction networks, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads us to the concept that IDP
signaling and regulation is tuned or
[SPEAKER_00]: altered by both alternative splicing and
by post-translational modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PTMs and especially PTM clusters
are typically located in IDP regions and
[SPEAKER_00]: that IDPs, alternative splicing,
and PTMs work together to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially true in proteins
associated with differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at this on a high level,
we can take complex multicellular
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms who require cell adhesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some proteins involved in cell
adhesion in metazoans, communication
[SPEAKER_00]: between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some nuclear hormone receptors are
involved in this communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developmental programs went a notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulation of development programs,
say the Hawke's transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting cell-specific
biochemistry physiology, BRCA1 would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we, and it turns out that all of
these proteins have been shown to use
[SPEAKER_00]: IDPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the question is, what about
alternative splicing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they, adding complexity to these guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do a simple search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on PubMed, and so here's cadherin,
we get 28,000 hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's cadherin plus PTMs, 3,000 hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cadherin plus alternative splicing,
177 hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And virtually all of these are happening
in the disordered regions of cadherin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 22 contain alternative splicing
plus PTMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On cadherin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you go down the list for these
developmentally important proteins or
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, and we get a similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for proteins that are involved in
differentiation, they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of disorder,
post-translational modification,
[SPEAKER_00]: and alternative splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IDPs play a key role in the functions
important for evolution of multicellular
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms, namely adhesion, communication,
development, regulation of development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cell-specific biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we need to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bits and pieces of this toolkit
have been shown to be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific regulatory and development
proteins at specific points in space and
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this field needs, I think,
is comprehensive study of many
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental and or regulatory proteins
to determine the extent to which IDPs and
[SPEAKER_00]: IDP regions, post-translational
modifications, and alternative splicing
[SPEAKER_00]: work together to specifically affect
phenotype and or developmental steps to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how common such collaborations
are among these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Carl and I have some papers on
specific proteins showing that all three
[SPEAKER_00]: of these three things are active in how
these proteins carry out their regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: functions related to differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are additional proteins,
like we did when we began the lecture by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about NFAT, and we showed how an
IDP region in NFAT contains a short
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling segment, namely a nuclear
localization signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed how this nuclear localization
signal is turned off by phosphorylation
[SPEAKER_00]: and turned on by dephosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's regulated by PTMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no information about alternative
splicing, so we did a simple search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We searched PubMed for NFAT and
alternative splicing, and many papers were
[SPEAKER_00]: found showing that different alternative
splicing isoforms led to differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: modulation of which genes got turned on
and off in which tissues, and that these
[SPEAKER_00]: play also a role in development,
not just in T-cell regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus, NFAT utilizes the IDP
alternative splicing PTM toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm suggesting is that we need
to look at this for many, many proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: that are associated with signaling,
regulation, development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prediction is we'll be finding
this combined use all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't shown this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm putting my email up here for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to do any of these searches
or if you want help with your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where you think this is certainly
not true, let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be great if we disproved it
for some systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we looked into it, we might find
it's where you guys hadn't thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, where you guys don't expect it,
where you guys don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would especially like to look at
some of those systems where you guys don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to sit down because I have
knees that don't like to keep me up on
[SPEAKER_00]: hard floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, don't pull it out from under me,
please.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a question right over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the description of how these
unstructured regions interact in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorylation and alternative splicing
makes an awful lot of sense from sort of a
[SPEAKER_04]: structural bias.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first group that you talked about
where it seemed that there were disordered
[SPEAKER_04]: regions that weren't involved in
phosphorylation or alternative splicing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the last bit you said there sort of makes
me think, well, maybe we're not those
[SPEAKER_04]: really are phosphorylated or alternative
splicing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they're not, it raises a really
interesting problem from a biological
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we have transcription factors
where there's a common structure of the
[SPEAKER_04]: transcription factor that binds to the
same sequences of DNA to regulate several
[SPEAKER_04]: proteins, or you have one protein that's
got disordered regions that binds to a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole bunch of different sequences in
order to regulate those same proteins,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have two very different evolutionary
motivations for, have you thought about
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or have you looked at the relative
frequency of those two different
[SPEAKER_04]: approaches to transcription factor
binding?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done any kind of comparative
work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are really important
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of us are limited by time and
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's so many questions we
haven't that have occurred to us that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just do the ones we can with
what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this last example with this
n-fat protein, we've had this,
[SPEAKER_00]: to our knowledge, that this n-fat protein
is very important in this immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's four different relatives
of n-fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't looked into the four genes
in detail and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just chosen one that's clearly
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the various diagrams you see,
it's got n-fat as this little structured
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA binding parts bound to DNA have
been crystallized and you can see their
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a domain, here's a domain,
here's a long linker between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost certainly unstructured when
it's not bound to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes structured when it binds to
DNA in the minor groove, just like these
[SPEAKER_00]: single chain things usually look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got all this disorder stuff
hanging out on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that it has this little
binding region to calcineurin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got like 12 or 13 sites of
phosphorylation, a few of which were shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that blocked the nuclear localization
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when this one piece binds to
calcineurin, how does this one enzyme with
[SPEAKER_00]: one little piece bind take off 12
different phosphates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's in a disordered region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine it's flopping around,
hits one, hits another, hits another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think anybody's ever proposed
that, but it's obvious when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the disorder prediction of what might be
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea that it also had an
alternative splicing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we asked that question, and yeah,
sure it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has it in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this simple idea can take
various experimentalists a little ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out new experiments to try in
their respective systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm hoping will happen
even if you want to disprove it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you want to show that we're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's the way science
progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear about something and you say,
oh, this certainly can't be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find out if it's not true in
your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we might find that it is true in some
of your systems that you're studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would please me greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I even heard a story today where
I gave a lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody responded to my lecture,
and they tried something, and they said it
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped them with their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very pleased to hear stories like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard stories the other way,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if your protein that
determines how much disorder there is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is sensitive to tell if it's a pH or a
calcium on the amount of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, tau, we predict it to be mostly
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about the tau protein
itself, or which protein?
[SPEAKER_02]: The program that you use to determine
disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we understand this can be
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are pH-sensing proteins that may
change their structure in response to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't played with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you pick what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's an important question.
Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a disorder domain in the
protein that's interacting with another
[SPEAKER_01]: protein, does that interaction site in
that other protein often assume a
[SPEAKER_01]: disordered state, or is it often ordered?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have any statistical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know of many examples where two
disordered regions get together and form
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a common well-known example are
leucine zippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each leucine zipper prior to their
interaction is disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a disordered region that you
think is interacting or might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with another disordered
region, there's a program called coils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which predicts local regions that can form
leucine zippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that you use that program
to see if your disordered region might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with another disordered region
to form a coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Wright has found two disordered
regions that are very long that interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them he studied by NMR
experimentally is a molten globule,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means basically a collapsed region of
disorder with secondary structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he found another long disordered
region that he studied by NMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely unfolded, completely
random coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these two guys got together,
it formed a six helix bundle that became a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully structured six helix bundle
with three helices from one region of
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder and three helices from another
region of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a structured protein that
was just built by two other pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a paper a very long time ago by a
woman named Maria Taseko where she took a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and I think it was, gee,
I can't remember the protein right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a well studied structured protein
that you could clip it in one place with
[SPEAKER_00]: one proteolytic enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could clip it in another place with
another proteolytic enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took these two pieces apart once
they were clipped, if you predicted on
[SPEAKER_00]: this protein both of these things,
in fact we did that later, and both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are predicted to be structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from a well structured protein,
but the individual halves, roughly halves,
[SPEAKER_00]: were by NMR unstructured proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them back together and they
refolded into a structured protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our predictors aren't going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a structured protein to form structure
it has to have the fitting of the various
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take out a piece of structure from
a structured protein and it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: its complement it may end up to be
disordered even though prediction would
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's well structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, did I get close to answering
your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of things happen when you
combine disorder with other disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do you see IEPs being conserved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Being conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll give you a different answer to
your question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this database called PFAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about PFAM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so PFAM was found, was developed by
finding sequences where you had high
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a sequence alignment
that's conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this PFAM domain, you can find the
same PFAM in different contexts,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would think of this as a structured
domain that gets used in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we applied our disorder
predictor to PFAM, some PFAMs were
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted to be entirely disordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be example of a conserved
sequence which you can find in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another group in Toronto,
a guy named Philip Kim and his
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators, and there's a woman there,
Julie Foreman Kay, who's been studying
[SPEAKER_00]: this disorder proteins for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really one of the leaders in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Philip Kim did a proteome-wide study
to determine to try to find conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called it constrained disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regions of disorder where the sequences
were conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our initial study of whether sequences
were conserved in disordered proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: we took a bunch of structured proteins
that had disordered tails or disordered
[SPEAKER_00]: loops and built the families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, the regions of disorder
had much less sequence conservation than
[SPEAKER_00]: the structured parts of the same proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found a couple examples where the
disordered regions had as much sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation as the structured regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can go that way, although that seems
to be more rare, rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the interest of Keith's need
and in the interest of his voice and in
[SPEAKER_03]: the interest of our schedule for lunch,
I'd like to ask you to thank him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
