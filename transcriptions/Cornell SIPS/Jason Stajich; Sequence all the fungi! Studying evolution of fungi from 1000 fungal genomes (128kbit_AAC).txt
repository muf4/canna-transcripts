[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real honor to be here and speak and
the chance to tell you about our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will jump in so I don't run over
time and give you an overview on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the really interesting questions you've
been able to ask in fungal evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to also pay tribute to the
beauty of the different organisms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to work on in fungal biology and in
mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of just a couple of
plates from a recent paper book chapter
[SPEAKER_00]: that we put out that is part of this new
book called The Fungal Kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a lot of really great
chapters about different aspects of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, but it includes some paying
homage to some of these beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I want to emphasize is
that if you don't work on fungi is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are, of course, many different cell
types and shapes and sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And colors that we see and trophic
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to understand the evolution
of these groups of organisms, how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: related to each other, and how some of
these different forms came about is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the driving questions that we've been
doing in my lab and across the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the driving questions is,
what are the evolutionary relationships of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I minimize this, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the evolutionary relationships
among fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this has been a driving part of
fungal systematics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, we use morphological
characteristics, sometimes ecologies to
[SPEAKER_00]: group things, then with the ability to use
molecular systematics to resolve the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was driven in part by the ability to
use PCR to sequence the ribosomal locus
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the landmark papers in
2006 as part of the tree of life work was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use a six gene phylogeny to
resolve the major lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, OK, we've got a good map
of how these organisms are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, as we start to look carefully
at those trees, we realize there are
[SPEAKER_00]: places that we don't really fully
understand the resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need additional sampling of both
markers and lineages to get at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the places that I'm going to
emphasize where we don't know the AMC
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, and we maybe still have questions,
relate to some of what we might call early
[SPEAKER_00]: branches, or at least what are the less
appreciated lineages in the past,
perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like zygomycete fungi and the
flagellated chytrid fungi, where some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the order of the branchings have been
unresolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that even within groups of things that
are well studied, like the basidiomycetes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include mushrooms, but also smuts
and rust, some of those relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: unresolved, even with sort of large
sampling and gene sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one approach to try to solve this
problem is to sequence more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one question that we'd like to
understand is how they're related,
[SPEAKER_00]: but why do we care about the tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to have a tree of how
they're related to each other allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at when characters evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did ecological associations arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they arise multiple times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plant pathogens come from a single
origin, so timing when those changes
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, when we look at more broader
context, the rise of diversity of fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: could be correlated with rise in diversity
of plants, or rise in diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding better the timing is
what the phylogenetic work allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: present, and then to correlate that with
other kinds of characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, we also can see things
like interesting morphological origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, on the top left here,
I will only briefly talk about this fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: called endogony, which looks like a
truffle, but is part of the zygomycete
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, which are typically, we look at
them as filamentous molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have examples of things that
have really complex morphology embedded
[SPEAKER_00]: within a group of organisms that don't
share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding how many times those
kinds of complexities arise is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and requires a well-resolved
phylogenetic tree and relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to sequence lots of things to get
at this better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably an overused graphic,
but the idea that we would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how they're related,
the easiest thing that we can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with today's technology,
is just turn the crank and generate more
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, through our partnership
with the Joint Genome Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a lot of sequencing capacity
and the interest and ability to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate more sequencing, more genomes,
and sampling the lineages to capture this
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our effort that with the initial,
what we call Community Sequencing Project
[SPEAKER_00]: that we proposed was, we called it the
thousand fungal genomes because we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a big, large number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are, at the time, approximately
500 families of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Noah's Ark of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get two from every group, and we make
sure they're covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truthfully, there are, of course,
more than that, but more families than
[SPEAKER_00]: 500, but this is a nice starting place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the initial goals are to better
reconstruct the phylogeny using many gene
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogeny not a six gene phylogeny,
but also to look at how the genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, look at how they change in
content, look at things like how
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates, carbohydrate, active
enzymes have changed, which relate to how
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms get their nutrients,
but also other aspects of their biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna give you a survey of some of
the things that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna indulge myself a little bit and
talk a little bit about some side projects
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are interesting that were related
to some of these investigations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tell you one story about complex
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another part of this is, of course,
it's important to take sometimes a focused
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one group that's not received as
much attention in the past for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genome sequencing projects and
molecular genetics in some ways has been
[SPEAKER_00]: what might be called the early diverging
fungi, but the zygomycetes and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: chytrid fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so zygomycetes were previously thought
to be one lineage, but I'll show you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: second that there are actually two major
lineages of that that constitute what are
[SPEAKER_00]: called zygomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our funded project to look at these
was to target about 150 reference genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in these lineages, and also to generate
between 500 and 1,000 light coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes that allow us to fill in the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna take a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in 2017, even when we proposed
this, it was 2014, but that we could take
[SPEAKER_00]: a really understudied group of organisms
and propose to do 150 genomes in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of a staggering to me to think
about where we are in our lifetime and the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that we have available to you
and the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't project yet what's gonna be 10
years from now, how straightforward,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, some of these things are gonna
be and the scale of things that we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna take, sometimes we're flippant
about how many genomes we can sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do recognize that this is a nice
thing that we have access to now and a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive our sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our questions by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to sequencing, we also
wanna understand the biology of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms and previous work had been
looked at aspects of the characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, fungi that grow in hyphal
forms have a concentration of vesicles at
[SPEAKER_00]: the tip called the spitzincorporate,
and that's found in Dicaria fungi like
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus or Neurospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's found in some of these zygomycete
fungi, which form hyphae, but not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Robbie Robertson, who's an expert
in imaging, has been working on using this
[SPEAKER_00]: big collection of zygomycete fungi to look
at which of these have spitzincorporates
[SPEAKER_00]: and when that evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one side question that's being
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second thing is that these are
typically, if you teach mycology,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take mycology, we talk about
zygomycete fungi as syncytic, is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have septa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, that is not the case for all
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding when and how septal
compartmentalization evolves within these
[SPEAKER_00]: groups is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, just to show you,
we don't know everything about these
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have better imaging, I had a
movie, but it's not going to show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these little vesicles here,
we don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably lipid-containing,
but they actually move quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real-time video.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just moving quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a mortiorella species that
makes lots of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding this is useful in the
industry, but also interesting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing is just that it's
a technological project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the efforts to generate
single-celled genomes, because some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these organisms, we can't grow alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to grow them with a host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the projects with the JGI
are about taking infected tissue and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating single spores or single cells,
sequencing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have several single-cell genome
projects that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do with some of these
genomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you some 10,000-foot
views of these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for example, these genomes vary in
size right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sampling that I'm showing you
between 2 to 150 megabases in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are fungal genomes that are
about 700 megabases to about 1.5
[SPEAKER_00]: gigabases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of these intamapathogenic
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harder to sequence because they're
so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have draft assemblies of a few
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some things that are
bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're full of transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a snapshot of the main bulk of
about 400 of these genomes that have come
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that as genome
size gets bigger, you have more genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have species that fall off that
curve that have large genomes but not so
[SPEAKER_00]: many genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those represent genomes that have a
lot of transposable elements in their
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genome is bigger, but that space is
taken up with by transposons, not
[SPEAKER_00]: protein-coding genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting observationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also look at another dynamic of
that of genome size and gene size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, some of the organisms have
very small genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microspridia are these obligate
intracellular parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very small genomes at the bottom
left corner here, 2 megabase, 4 megabase
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have very short genes on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've made your genome smaller,
and the genes in your genome have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example, presumably,
of contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have other organisms that
have long transcripts but not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: a bigger genome up at the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything can be ascribed to ecology,
but those are interesting observations we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing that we can look
at is just the size of the genome and the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of introns that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a case where we can see
different clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the colors here represent different
major clades of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different clades have really different
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, an indulgence to my
PhD thesis where I worked a little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that things like
Saccharomycetina, so Saccharomyces,
[SPEAKER_00]: have very few introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that top left corner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only have 300 introns in the whole
genome in some of these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have other species down here
at the bottom, the mushrooms, that tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: have many, many introns per gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the scale is kind of reversed
because it's about how big the exons are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not how many introns, but the idea is that
so you can see that this kind of falls out
[SPEAKER_00]: by some of the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a history in how gene
structure evolves in fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to compare that across
common sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, there's differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal genomes are not uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be one takeaway that you can
get from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that's driven by historical
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so how do we understand how these
organisms are related to each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing we can do is try to build
biogenetic trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one pipeline that we use is using
both a set of predetermined conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that we have about 434 that we've
picked out that behave well as being found
[SPEAKER_00]: in most fungi and also in some of the
outgroups that we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identify these proteins in all of
our genomes in a rapid succession and then
[SPEAKER_00]: build multiple alignments of each of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trim and quality control and
concatenate those and build phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: trees from concatenated data sets as well
as individual gene trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at congruence of all of these and
try to generate a consensus phylogeny of
[SPEAKER_00]: the organisms to understand how they're
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those, again, this is maybe for
those of you who are interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: methods part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also trying to understand
when these organisms diverge from each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also incorporate fossil data that's
been collected and calibrate some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time points in the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started this project,
I was like, oh, fungi don't need fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the late Tom Taylor in his work did
amazing work in paleobotany and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect and identify and characterize
structures that seem to be fungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was part of our grant and our
project to collect more of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for the zygomycete fungi,
but also to put that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I've already showed you this
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can generate a really big, beautiful
tree that is hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can summarize that into the
other major lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things that we learned,
and I'm going to come back to this point
[SPEAKER_00]: again, is that we do, these are sort of
known relationships of the dicaria fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ascomycetes and the decidomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one of the major findings is that
what we call the mucoromycota now
[SPEAKER_00]: represents these three lineages used to be
kind of in a raid more closely with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dicaria, that this glomeromycota used to
be more closely related here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we find them as one group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the second group we call
zoopagomycota represent organisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: intima pathogenic fungi, as well as
mycoparasites that infect other fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are really fun to study,
but hard to dissect in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have some unresolved lineages
in here that represent lineages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chytridomycota, which we have the chytrids
and the blastoclidomycota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these groups have flagella
flagellated zoospore fungi, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: branching order has been a little bit
ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do think that probably
blastoclidomycota is sister to the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the chytridomycota is sister to
these, but that's been still a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's other unknowns that we
have that I can just throw in here more
[SPEAKER_00]: for the aficionados that help us try to...
We have basidiobolus and opidium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are part of the... This looks like a
chytrid, but it actually groups within
[SPEAKER_00]: these groups right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to understand these
relationships is still part of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we look at the dating of this
phylogeny?
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating these different fossil
calibration points, we're able to put some
[SPEAKER_00]: dates on the fungal emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the interesting things is
there's a window of time when many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal phyla emerge, which is also related
to a similar timing to when we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the explosion of land plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is a lot of these
are timed within the same period and that
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the diversity that we see arose
here in this window of time is best we can
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are helpful in trying to
put the context as to when did fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you hadn't seen this before,
but we do think that the origin of fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you define fungi,
but is probably in about a billion years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an old group of organisms if you
put them all on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I say if, because there's some
debate or some worth of discussion about
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you define what is a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually a great chapter from
Tom Richards in that book about these
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, this is helpful to look
at the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do when we look at these
genomes of these organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one aspect that is interesting is
we can look at gene diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation and duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm plotting here is this is a
species tree of about 72 fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm putting in these colors,
these circles, where there are pulses of
[SPEAKER_00]: more copies of gene families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is this is when there has
been innovation in the history of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that there are a couple
of, so it's not uniform, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that there's a pulse in every
node.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain nodes that have a lot of
gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these seem to be related to this
big burst of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things, again,
when we talk about when did fungi emerge,
[SPEAKER_00]: this label I put here at the bottom,
there isn't a lot of diversification
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at that node.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually happens a little bit later in
terms of the gains that we see in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: new gene families and new diversification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's an interesting, another way
that we can kind of put this in context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do think this helps us better
understand when some of the changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have driven some of the
fungal-specific biology might have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we also do find big examples of
gains, and I'm going to talk more about
[SPEAKER_00]: this group in a second, that relate to
horizontal gene transfer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one group I was just mentioning,
and I'm going to go through some of this a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit quicker so I can get to the
end, but is the neocalamastica mycota
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, which are really fun to say 10
times fast in a row, but are the anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: gut fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on an Ag campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have cows that have fistulas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in there, and you can sample
fluid from the rumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside that anaerobic fluid,
you can culture anaerobic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are zoosporic fungi that are
really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have hydrosomes, and they are
obliquely anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a project that we're working on
with Mustafa Elshahid and Noha Yousaf at
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma State is to sequence
transcriptomes, because these genomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit hard to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty repeat heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequence transcriptomes of about 20 to
25 of these species to try to better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand their relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a tree showing the dating
of this, which is interesting in this
[SPEAKER_00]: context, because this group of anaerobic
gut fungi, these are all the lineages that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to sample of these groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they emerge relatively recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually emerge pretty close to,
that's what this green box here is,
[SPEAKER_00]: the origin of herbivory in mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ecological niche where we isolate
them from correlates in time with the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a whole lot of time on this
branch between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did they come from before there were
rumen guts to live in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but this is what we can talk
about with the samples that we can sample
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's maybe new other interesting
diversity to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an interesting way to look at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the, sorry, one other
thing we can look at is the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these different structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, some of these have
polycentric and monocentric forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see again that those
probably emerge multiple times within
[SPEAKER_00]: these lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, being able to look at now
gene content and genes that are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: these groups is part of trying to
understand diversification there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can even find genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a kind of a pictorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to remind me to tell you that
these fungi have lost certain processes in
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's an example of a gene that's
not found in any other fungi except for
[SPEAKER_00]: one weird group called the city obelis,
but that they have gained genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of a gene that is probably
related to its growth and its anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can find things that probably
they had to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I'm showing you all
these branches is that all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms, all of these AGM fungi have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't a horizontal transfer of just
one or a bad genome assembly where we just
[SPEAKER_00]: picked it up accidentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually found in all of these
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's diversified probably following
the species diversification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these might be genes that are necessary
or important in that adaptation to that
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this will be cool ways to
better understand the biology as we start
[SPEAKER_00]: to map these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there aren't that many genes that fall
into these categories of being unique to
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe missing from these anaerobic
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see, again, mitochondria loss
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing we can do when we have
these genomes is try to ask other
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about genome evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one interesting thing that people ask
a lot in plants, but hasn't been asked as
[SPEAKER_00]: much in fungi, is what happens when you
get a genome duplication?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a well-told story about
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a whole genome duplication about
100 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can map what happens to gene
duplicates in the time that occurs after
[SPEAKER_00]: the duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really cool for evolutionary
biologists because there's lots of theory
[SPEAKER_00]: about what happens when you duplicate
genes and you see what happens after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plants, one of the ways that this
was looked at from transcriptomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, and something from Ken Wolf's lab
that was first published were these graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: where you show a plot of the average
synonymous site differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So synonymous sites are basically supposed
to be neutral changes that you can count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're calibrated with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a whole genome duplication
and you had 100 genes and you duplicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that to 200 genes, and each of those has a
pair, and at time point zero right after
[SPEAKER_00]: the duplication, the difference between
any of those pairs is zero because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as time passes and independent
mutations occur in those, those gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs, each of them starts to get
different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that difference we can measure with
the synonymous site difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that difference looks kind of like
a peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every gene gets the same number of
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that peak starts to move over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually guess when the
duplication occurred by looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of this peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plant genomes, when you see
multiple duplications, you see one peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see actually another peak for
multiple duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an echo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you can approach this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 300 genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look for parologous genes in those
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can ask, what's the synonymous site
diversions of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can find examples like this for a
fungus like a chytrid fungus called
[SPEAKER_00]: Allomyces, which has this nice pattern of
lots of things that are duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sort of distribution that we
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like it's probably actually a
diploid assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the alleles are pretty different from
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't collapse into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the actual biology of why
it has so many copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an example where we think it's
probably because it's a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at something like this
across all of the genomes, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get these patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing to look at specifically there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can pull up something like
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication occurred 100 million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that KS value has gotten really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not that many pairs that are
that similar to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is about 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Saccharomyces, again, there's only
a few that are really similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is kind of enough time has
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can look more carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually find an organism that does
seem to have this whole genome duplication
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurred quite recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fungus called Hortea or
Nechiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this had been previously described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm cherry picking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had already been known as a genome
with whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had done an initial kind of low
quality Illumina assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a pack bioassembly in
collaboration with Corey Nistel's lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to then look at the genome
duplications and identify that most genes
[SPEAKER_00]: were in this orange category here,
where it were duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the genes in the genome had two
copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can look at the dates of those
genes, the average age of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see that divergence pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's cool about this is this is
really a real whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably the most recent one that
we can identify based on these comparisons
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the genomes that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's so many genes in the
genome that are basically one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: parallels, and that we can map it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a black yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extremophile in the sense that it
grows in really high salt concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was isolated originally from these salt
terns when you make sea salts and you let
[SPEAKER_00]: the water evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find some fungi growing in this
really high salt molarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also find it in marine
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of cool because they call it
a yeast, but actually it grows
[SPEAKER_00]: filamentously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a diphydeomycete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at these cells under a
dissection scope, you can see that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually these colonies that have hyphae
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not really yeast, even though
they make these kind of gooey black stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: here when you look at them on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is my other indulgence,
is that in our lab, we've also started
[SPEAKER_00]: working on some extremophiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a collaborating visiting
student who works on Antarctic endolithic
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole other interesting question of you
break open rocks from Antarctica,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you culture what's inside them,
and you think nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, there are a bunch of fungi
that do grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one species of that is called
Hortea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a species called Hortea phylandica,
which is actually isolated from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only an extremophile living in
cold, but this is an isolate that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sequenced the genome of that and
put it in the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the closest thing we have to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does not have the whole gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have the whole genome
duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by being able to put this in the
phylogenetic context, I can tell you that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a species that doesn't have the
duplication and a species that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the ability to look at a
single copy gene in one species that's
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicated into two in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, from an evolutionary,
molecular, evolutionary perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a nice toolkit to be able to
explore more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that any of this tells us why
it's able to live in Antarctica or live in
[SPEAKER_00]: these extreme environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, just an advertisement we
sequenced in blue or other species from
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica that we sequenced the genomes
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to understand a little
bit better how they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any things about being an
extremophile that are diagnostic to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing about these duplicates is
that we can look at not only just the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are there, the copies of the
genes, we can look at their expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the gene expression differences on
the left here in blue are how different
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression values are for these gene
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in general, they tend to be very
similar to each other because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tend to have sort of the same
nucleosome occupancy, but there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is comparing something like
Saccharomyces, which has had a whole gene
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication, which is a lot older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see more variation in the kinds
of differential expression that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see about copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are examples in Hortea where
there's a gene copy that's expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: high-salt environments and a copy that's
expressed in low-salt environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's transporters and there's other
things about adaptation to that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to it than this,
but this is kind of one snapshot view of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the ecology of an organism
that's had this duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably not going to cover
everything today, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the Zygolife project is,
again, this ability to sequence lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genomes trying to sequence both with
low coverage genome approaches to get low
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, use low amounts of genome
sequencing to still get at enough
[SPEAKER_00]: information to build gene trees or species
trees and try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do a better job in sequencing the
ribosomal locus for doing barcoding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the driving that...
I'm not going to put the trees in here for
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but it is working well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also try to study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is this improved tree
of the Zygomycete fungi that are really in
[SPEAKER_00]: these two major lineages, the mucormycota
and the zoopagomycota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just annoying for those of
you who teach psychology because you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to update your slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important in trying to understand
the biology there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that again, as I was saying,
the glomeromycota or micotina,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you feel like you've been demoted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a micotina versus a micota?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, these are, again,
important parts of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one other thing that we've done is
that the glomeromycotina are an important
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to sequence these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are obligate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't sequence them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't grow them, that many of them,
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through single cell RNAseq,
single cell amplification and RNAseq,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to generate transcriptomes with
work from Niko Kurok.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, just approaches that
we're able to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't so important, but just that
pretty pictures of these different cell
[SPEAKER_00]: types and that we're able to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to isolate these all from a plant
and then sort the cells and sequence them
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is all pioneered by Niko
Kurok's lab in Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the last thing I'm going to do in
my 10 minutes, you want me to stop it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm looking 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I won't overwhelm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that one last question about
evolution of multicellularity in fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I've been interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown you lots of pictures of
microscopic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, of course, hopefully, you live in a
beautiful part of the world where there
[SPEAKER_00]: are lots of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk outside and you see a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're unlucky and you live in where
I am, you leave the hose on, and suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just this weird circular growing
out of the ground in your water,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your flower bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some fungi you like, some fungi you
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that you know that
there's really different morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really different complexity
that we might see in some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we'd like to understand is,
how did some of that come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we map when in time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of changes might be
important to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did this in part because we
observed these examples, multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: examples, in the fungal tree of organisms
that make multicellular structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I'm showing you sort of a
sampling of the fungal phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm showing you this thing called
undogony, which falls within our zygomyces
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the zygomyces fungi are sort of
filamentous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this thing that makes a truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks something like a tuber truffle
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, of course, have mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some other examples of
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those is an organism called
neolecta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in blue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neolecta falls within a group that you
might recognize at least one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: names, schizosaccharomyces palmi.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 4,500 gene yeast, that single cell that
has this fission yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this organism called
neolecta that makes these fruiting bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look a lot like earth tones,
but they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this has been an enigma as to what
this thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, is it real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really an ascomyce fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really an ascomyce fungus that falls
within what we call the defrinomycotina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pneumocystis is, again, like a single cell
obligate parasite of lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things in here that this cytella
is a yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we seeing this sort of thing
that makes these big, relatively big
[SPEAKER_00]: structures?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you have a hammer,
everything is a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sequenced the genome of it,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is court.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't culture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to sequence from fruiting
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which worked out OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made a reasonably good assembly,
but not as good as we get with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows us to try to use this system
to try to compare neolecta with these
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular fruiting bodies to other
organisms related to it that don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: that, as well as things that we have good
model systems for, like Neurospor crassa
[SPEAKER_00]: or Aspergillus nidulans or Copernopsis
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can take those sporocops and
sequence them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at some really,
again, like top level statistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: are genomes of organisms that are
multicellular more complex in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think that if you have a more
complicated fruiting body structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you have more genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neolecta falls within.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are basically what we might
call single-celled yeast, mostly yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: forming for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of our filamentous
physisomicatina fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it does not have more
genes than its relatives or the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that it shared that we'll find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a gene count perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look and see if there is any
example of lots of gene gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a lot of novel genes that
nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neolectas in blue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we only find this sort of
number, something on the order of this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of 800 gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relative to some of its other
relatives are on this branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about 25 genes really represent sort
of a novelty in this lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not gaining a whole bunch of stuff
and losing a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it has some massively new
set of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was maybe one believable hypothesis
or plausible hypothesis that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we wanted to look more broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the genes that we can find other
organisms that we would call complex
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these organisms make septated
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have channels to separate cells,
which are really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to understand when did this
gating mechanism evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll explain that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have mechanisms for how
hyphae fuse together and remodel,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really a major principle in how
you form mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this whole knotting and fusing of
hyphae to make, well, and ascomycetes to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the sexual structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those genes look like in these
species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with Greg Jed's lab in
Singapore, who's a cell biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: works a lot on some of these aspects of
cell biology and in Neurospora especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we started with, as we said,
we took organisms like Neurospora and
[SPEAKER_00]: others, and we asked, what are the genes
that are shared among organisms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would call complex multicellular?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of genes in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk through a couple of
these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a set of genes that we know
are important in plugging holes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: septum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure I put the figure of
what this looks like in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are a bunch of proteins that we
know are important in separating cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that separating two cell
types is probably an important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of being multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those genes are only found in these
ascomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not found in anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are other genes that are
involved in what's called the septal
[SPEAKER_00]: forecap, which is another kind of plugging
technology or component that fungi use,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, to gate their cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we think about this is
you're a submarine, and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: different compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're in a lab, and someone brings a
razor blade and cuts part of your hyphae,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you start to bleed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the submarine, you'd like to
close off those doors and stop this
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are these pores that can be
occluded by a protein that prevent that
[SPEAKER_00]: leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proteins that are involved in
blocking those pores in ascomycetes,
[SPEAKER_00]: in psizomycotina ascomycetes, are these
proteins like hex and lesion and whisk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a different set of proteins
that are involved in that pore in
[SPEAKER_00]: basidiomycetes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So independent origins of that technology
or that innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these proteins here are involved
in hyphal fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these do not seem to be found
in the electa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, dead end on this,
this is not necessarily showing us a
[SPEAKER_00]: component that's related to
multicellularity from our hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of starting out hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let me just visibly show you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In psizomycotina, you have this sort of
raft, this light boat raft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must be scared of drowning again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all these examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have this raft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as there's flow through there,
they get liberated, and they plug the hole
[SPEAKER_00]: in psizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a septal forecap that's
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In basidiomycetes, it's a little bit less
well-known.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to know what does it look like
in neolacta.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like under the EM of
that pore in neolacta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually makes this protein
aggregate, which is involved in plugging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not showing you the picture of
this in psizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's similar but different in the
sense that there's some sort of protein
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate that's fitting in that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the proteins that we know
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something else novel that's gone in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know what it is yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried a couple of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't actually have the protein yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visibly, you can see that it's doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, just reiterating what I just
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what's known in psizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this hex protein that gets
decorated with these sticky things that
[SPEAKER_00]: stick together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're involved in plugging in that
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those proteins are necessary for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're only found in those
psizomycotina parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, because in a way,
we further confirmed that this is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the psizomycotina evolved to deal
with how they plug their septum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's older than the
psizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can look at other proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of taking you down this big
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other proteins that do seem
to be shared among many of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily specific to the
complex multicellularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some proteins that are
involved in really old, the stripat
[SPEAKER_00]: complex is a really old complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually found in lots of eukaryotes
that it's involved in development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not surprised that it's
basically found to be conserved,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, our candidate gene approach
didn't necessarily pick out totally
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious things that we were hoping would
be able to tell us what's going on from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did use a different approach,
where we say, can we find genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: really follow the pattern and really tend
to be in the complex multicellular fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and missing in things like saccharomyces
or candida, which are single cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do look at things involved in light
response, reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, also seems to be quite not
completely specific to, but quite enriched
[SPEAKER_00]: and missing in the saccharomyces lineages
that relate to reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the genes in terms of some of
the chitin synthase genes involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: remodeling are only found in these species
that have the complex multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a perfect match, but it is useful
to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's an example of a protein
that's a septal pore associated protein
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, for example, female sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably a protein involved in
making a sexual structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Neurospora, where we're able to
do the experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can show that that's an important
protein that has this pattern of being
[SPEAKER_00]: only in these two fungi and not in the
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to get at more than just
making gene lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually trying to test these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to do it in Neurospora,
because that's a system where we can knock
[SPEAKER_00]: out the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a further narrow down to
novel genes that seem to show this
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have to squint a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously use this sort of darker color
to represent kind of degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these proteins may be not
necessarily all lost in the single celled
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, although some of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that we start to test, these are genes
that have not been necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the function of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they seem to show a pattern that's
consistent with this complex
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Gregg's lab did is tag these
and look at where they localized to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, some of these proteins
are, the details aren't so important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that we can look at where they
localized to and see that many of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched for transmembrane domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these have novel localization
or a novelty associated protein with
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to take home is, this is more like
a framework for it, is to try to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to prioritize genes that might be
important in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one final kind of example to walk
through from the work was that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: this protein that's involved in this dyne
binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this P150-glued protein is involved in
this microtubule binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's interesting is this is a
protein, what I want you to get away from
[SPEAKER_00]: this is it's not about whether or not the
gene is present or absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about this,
and this is what this plot is showing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there are parts of the protein
which are shared among the fungi that have
[SPEAKER_00]: complex multicellularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are parts of the protein that
are missing in the fungi that are single
[SPEAKER_00]: celled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they still have the same gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just go by orthology,
you can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on par, most of the species that don't
make these complex structures have lost
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the take home of this
figure and this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the dotted lines are the places
where it's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are involved in some of the
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it might be that, again,
when you think about this, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the ideas, you have to
transport things along a hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the need for some of
these binding and these proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: the function that these proteins play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's a harder thing to
write really good software to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an effort of really studying the
protein and knowing what it did and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what parts of it were important in
order to find a pattern like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes our job harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just sequence a genome and say
the genes that are in the complex ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the single celled ones are the
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are examples of things where I
think as we dig into it, we can find a
[SPEAKER_00]: better interpretation of the important
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another way to look at that
picture of that same certain bits that are
[SPEAKER_00]: missing in some of these single celled
ones, but where the neolacta protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: its sister species really still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it starts to get lost again and
shrink in some of these single celled
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not be convinced that this is
exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think these are the trends that
we're trying to dig into deeper instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking at presence absence as a way
to make a characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we can look for gene loss across
a big set of species or gene gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for example, I didn't show you the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that flagella were lost in
species that don't have flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were early lineages that do have
flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very easy signal to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find those proteins missing in all
the species that don't make flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can look for other characteristics
that relate to things like
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've got this more nuanced way
of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do think that we have some tools
for being able to jump into that,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, this is the Wild West of
some of our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of our Zygolife project team is a
big collaboration of a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: labs that have been contributing to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And students in my lab that have been
working on different parts of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Postdoc Usmani who did all the
neolacta work in my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the color version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I will take and also take your
kids sampling in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't going to smile for the camera,
but it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I will stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take any questions if there's any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for your talk on the
best organisms on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was a great overview of
phylogeny, function, and evolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: In commemoration and in gratitude,
we have a little plaque for the lecture
[SPEAKER_08]: series.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your analysis of the kind of
inferred genome duplications, how can you
[SPEAKER_01]: separate that from possible hybridization
events?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we would have to do a secondary
set of analyses to try to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should be sequencing more
than one individual for any given species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would allow us to at least add
some population variation in that to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if the same region is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're thinking like a little bit
older hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the mechanism by which you
duplicated maybe doesn't have to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: endo duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more, are there twice as many
genes is the first signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it depends a lot on how you're
going to maintain those duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see in some species what looks to
be diploids that then lose heterozygosity
[SPEAKER_00]: and other kind of patterns that really
suggest that you kind of, it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid that's hybridization as opposed to
really maintaining a duplicate set of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's probably part of what we
might have to tease out as to how
[SPEAKER_00]: different the alleles are in those
duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really get at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right, there's a gradient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a feature in rust fungi called
obligate biotropy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible to understand how those
genes became dedicated to maintaining that
[SPEAKER_04]: system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the answer is hopefully,
yes, we'll be able to get at either the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism requirements that have made
them obligate or that support the obligate
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the best way to be able to have it is
you have a species that isn't obligate and
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to compare what's different,
at least at that starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's where we would start
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that we have,
I haven't focused on that lineage yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rust genomes tend to be pretty big,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're obligate, but they're not
necessarily reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think trying to understand some
of that is still ongoing as people get
[SPEAKER_00]: more sampling of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a retro transpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: These extremophile co-adopted fungi,
do they represent the atomic diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this just one narrow group of highly
specialized organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are extremophiles just in one part of
the tree, basically?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of endothiomycetes that
represent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other examples of extremophiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermophilic extremophiles are found in
different parts of the tree as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a microbiome ITS kind of
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is you get a lot of
lichens out of that, because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: typically is the biomass inside those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to do culturing,
you can obviously see a bit more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the ones that, so we do have one
basidiomycete or rotatorula.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be associated with the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's predominantly
dothidiomycetes that have been put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture collections that we're able to use
or we've been able to kind of work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are some other
psizomycotinous, other filamentous
[SPEAKER_00]: astromycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the K-3 alias would be the other group
where you see those as well, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of two groups of kind of
black yeasts, and that's kind of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelsea?
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the multicellularity question,
I'm sort of thinking about the protein
[SPEAKER_05]: plugs, but this would be various traits
that are associated with multicellularity.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times do you have
multicellularity evolving?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what I was talking about with the
plugs, you've got three different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: plugs happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they using an ancestral mechanism,
or are they just all doing it differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think how many times multicellularity
evolved in fungi is somewhat debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As to whether or not what you define as
complex multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, just forming a fruiting,
any kind of complex fruiting body probably
[SPEAKER_00]: might be multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to, so that's a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about this very specific
thing, the plugging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need septa to be able to have the
plugging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't think that the ancestor of the
fungi had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that probably, at least from our
reconstruction, that the, we do see septa
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the, what's called the
kick-cellomycotina, but within the
[SPEAKER_00]: zygomycetes, we do see one other example
of septa, but we haven't, we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about the pore structure there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, but because of this look at work
at Neolecta, we can at least say there's
[SPEAKER_00]: three origins of that kind of plugging in
the examples that we've looked at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is more than before, where we would
have just said two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, we'd say that the Dicaria
fungi, so the ancestor of the ascomycetes
[SPEAKER_00]: and basidiomycetes, must not have had
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we independently evolved it two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might mean that the ancestor of
Dicaria didn't really have septa or true
[SPEAKER_00]: septal need for true septal pores until
later because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the parsimonious
interpretation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's some gain-loss thing that
we, you know, it's really rapid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the genomes then you would see
there's something associated with needing
[SPEAKER_05]: to plug your septa, but it could be
different in every single case and you
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't see loss necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any cases where you go back to
single cellular, multi-cellular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, so I think that,
yeah, I, so I think the tefrinomycotina
[SPEAKER_00]: probably represent that and that you see
simplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think sacromycotein, if you look at
the tree, sacromycotina represents a
[SPEAKER_00]: simplification too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably the ancestor of sacromycotein
and sacromycin had more, was more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you've seen simplification or
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genomes are smaller and they have
fewer cell wall encoding genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things that might be involved in
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have these hypofusion genes
that are shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, yeah, we do think that
it's actually simplification or however
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do, you know, that sort of has
a loaded term, but like losses are driving
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's one other point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming there's a wealth of data,
genetic data, with model filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How well does that, do those data inform
phylogenetic analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, in one part we've lit,
we are still probably working on
[SPEAKER_00]: integration of those data in the right
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been sort of siloed,
you know, there's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: saccharomyces data set database and
ability to look at gene function in those
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can map those onto a Neurospora
gene and ask, is there good evidence they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same function or they're part of
the same process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Although sometimes that's a circular
inference because the annotation
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurospora might be driven from the
saccharomyces homolog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of how it maps on the file,
I don't know that we've really looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: it in terms of phylogenetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just tried to ask, are there
consistency between them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the best place where it's been
done is like, there's a systematic
[SPEAKER_00]: knockout set in POMB and saccharomyces,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a case where you'd want to
ask for each ortholog, is the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty similar or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Neurospora, we have a systematic
knockout collection, but they've not been
[SPEAKER_00]: all phenotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so probably about 1,500 to 2,000,
maybe about 2,000 have really been
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyped out of that 10,000 knockout
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what's limiting it right
now is really to systematically have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are doing like growth rate and
sexual reproduction and a few other things
[SPEAKER_00]: are being scored, but I wouldn't say it's
actually, the resources are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not sure all of it's been kind of
really assayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is no, I have not
looked at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of labs that have been
focused on mitochondrial evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: More focused on some of the early,
the chytrids and the zygomyces fungi than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely an open question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the short answer is it needs
better work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's just not enough people
who've really delved into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes with the genome assemblies,
it takes a little extra effort to pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial reads and call that
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually that hard, but it hasn't
probably been done as systematically as it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's kind of an open space that
hasn't gotten as much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if the inheritance of
mitochondria is an interesting question
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of who, which parent donates in
and in the interactions between the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear genome and the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely interesting
experiments mostly in like multi-nucleate
[SPEAKER_00]: zygomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sort of tracking things through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are interesting research
questions about those interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know that like a systematic
here's all the mitochondria and their
[SPEAKER_00]: content and what's been gained and lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of like individual examples
of like intron gain and loss and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's, I think it's an
open space that someone needs more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
