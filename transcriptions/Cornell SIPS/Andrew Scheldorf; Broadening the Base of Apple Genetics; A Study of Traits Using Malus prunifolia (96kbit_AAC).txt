[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jason, for that introduction
and thank you everyone for coming to
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to my seminar.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a partial completion of my V exam
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was incredibly special to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As mentioned, my topic or my seminar is
broadening the base of Apple genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: a study of traits using malus pernifolia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we really get into the meat of
my project itself, I wanted to give us
[SPEAKER_04]: some framing information about apple
breeding and how we got here in the state
[SPEAKER_04]: of the world of apple genetics and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The apple center of origin is thought to
be in Kazakhstan in the Kazakh mountains
[SPEAKER_04]: with a population of medium to large
fruits in these mountains with early
[SPEAKER_04]: hybridizations from malus picata and malus
asiatica, which are thought to be possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: originally isolated groups of malus
aversiae, which is one of the founding
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humans then carried these larger fruit and
malus aversiae along the Silk Road,
[SPEAKER_04]: resulting in further hybridizations with
possibly some other Asian species such as
[SPEAKER_04]: malus pernifolia until arriving in Europe,
where there was a late intense
[SPEAKER_04]: interspecific hybridization with malus
silvestris, which is a species known to be
[SPEAKER_04]: firmer and more acidic, but smaller in
fruit size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, more intentional selection and
growing resulted in the malus ex domestica
[SPEAKER_04]: that we are more familiar with today,
which is known to be firm, sweet,
[SPEAKER_04]: aromatic, tart with larger fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that story of domestication and there
is silvestris.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that story of domestication then led to
into hundreds of years of intentional
[SPEAKER_04]: apple selection and breeding by humans to
bring us here where we have amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars such as snapdragon and ruby
frost, new york one and new york two,
[SPEAKER_04]: which were released from Cornell rather
recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple, if you're unaware, is a clonally
propagated species and fruit is marketed
[SPEAKER_04]: by cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has resulted in certain cultivars
becoming more widely planted and more
[SPEAKER_04]: widely sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these cultivars mostly have larger
fruit with lower acid, higher sweetness
[SPEAKER_04]: and are often red in color or have a
blush.
[SPEAKER_04]: How we market and sell apples by cultivars
for commercial use has resulted in a
[SPEAKER_04]: reduction in diversity of apples that are
grown for commercial use, though breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: pools and repositories like the one in
Geneva show higher diversity still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have not lost the diversity of malus
in this breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have in the graph, we have the top
nine cultivars that are sold in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are likely pretty familiar with these
cultivars, you know, granny smith,
[SPEAKER_04]: pink lady, golden delicious, gala,
red delicious, honey crisp and macintosh
[SPEAKER_04]: to name them and Fuji.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these first degree relationships are
demonstrated by these gray circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that just means that they are
otherwise a sibling, a parent or a child
[SPEAKER_04]: of these very popular cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's plenty of hybridization
between these as well as results in a
[SPEAKER_04]: rather reduced amount of cultivars
commercially available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has resulted in some problems
specifically related around disease and
[SPEAKER_04]: disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which brings us to my project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So malus pernifolia is a West Asian
species of apple that was possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in domestication along the Silk
Road depicted here.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a photo, it would be on the smaller
malus species on the left of your screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see here on the right,
a diversity panel of all of the malus
[SPEAKER_04]: pernifolia inside of the genetic
repository in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that malus pernifolia as a
species really runs the gamut in sorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit shape, color and size.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a rather interesting species.
[SPEAKER_04]: The specific malus pernifolia that I have
used in my study is malus pernifolia
[SPEAKER_04]: 19651, which from here on out,
I am just going to refer to as malus
[SPEAKER_04]: pernifolia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will trip over those numbers constantly
if I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This individual has been used as a part of
the malus core collection, which means it
[SPEAKER_04]: has been included in multiple linkage
studies and mapping studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a individual, it clusters with
other Asian species, but not always with
[SPEAKER_04]: other pernifolia sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's dihydrochalcone profile,
which dihydrochalcones are phenolic
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds that are of interest in
increasing beneficial health compounds in
[SPEAKER_04]: apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dihydrochalcone profile indicates
that there was some species admixture in
[SPEAKER_04]: its background.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not even sure that it's actually
malus pernifolia, but it is the
[SPEAKER_04]: designation that we are currently using.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's of interest because of its
apparent strong fire blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other proof biochemical traits,
as well as its usefulness as a wild
[SPEAKER_04]: species in genetic studies trying to
understand novel traits from not
[SPEAKER_04]: underutilized species in breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other parent in this population of
trees is called New York CO1.
[SPEAKER_04]: CO stands for clumnar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a malus ex domestica,
meaning it is the standard domesticated
[SPEAKER_04]: apple that we are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has clumnar habits, meaning that it
grows very vertically upright with short
[SPEAKER_04]: spurs and very few outward branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's more like a pillar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some photos of it coming up later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in its background, it has ponova,
which is a German cultivar, suncrisp,
[SPEAKER_04]: and widget macintosh, which widget
macintosh is the origin of the clumnar
[SPEAKER_04]: habit in malus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a large rooted individual with
yellow skin and a slight blush to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other characteristics I will be
listing later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these two individuals are quite
different, which results in a rather
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting display of trait segregations
that I will be touching on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a general summary of this
population, like I said, it was a cross
[SPEAKER_04]: made between New York CO1 and malus
pernifolia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it resulted in 600 seeds that were
then germinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of them died due to a lethality
gene and resulted in a validated
[SPEAKER_04]: population of 423 individuals,
which I validated using GBS markers and
[SPEAKER_04]: PCA, principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that broke down into 226 standard
trees and 197 clumnar trees, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: about 50-50, which is what we would expect
in the segregation ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's dwarf types within that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really going to be touching on
trait architecture during this talk,
[SPEAKER_04]: though there are some interesting
components of that that I will be
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing in publications and findings
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So briefly, this talk is going to focus on
three things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit storage, and I will be talking about
storage genes and genotypes, associations,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then an RNA-seq experiment that was
used to clarify kind of what's going on in
[SPEAKER_04]: storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruit organic acidity, genetics,
pH and titratable acid was measured,
[SPEAKER_04]: associations were found.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll be discussing deviations and
distortions unique to this population or
[SPEAKER_04]: unique to this breeding pool in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, fruit quality traits,
which I will just be touching briefly on
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit size.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I measured a number of other
traits, including bricks, presence of
[SPEAKER_04]: brusset, and phenolic compounds,
along with several others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And isn't this such a pretty image?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're siblings and have very different
colors, flowers, but they're both clumnar.
[SPEAKER_04]: This population is really stunning in
flowering and fruiting, just in kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: the breadth that it covers, and it's
always fun to walk through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I followed this population for four
years, three pretty intensely,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then one with some extra data to get
three years to report on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2019, 176 individuals fruited.
[SPEAKER_04]: The traits that I collected are listed
there, including total acid, pH,
[SPEAKER_04]: bricks, phenolic compound, shape and size,
color, and then fruits and cuticle
[SPEAKER_04]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2020, 288 individuals fruited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all those previous traits were
collected as well as mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I added a color reminder to the
technical mix so I could measure more
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate color.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2021, 306 individuals fruited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And RNA samples were taken along with all
of that previous data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I checked the population for
starch iodine index at harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2022, 308 individuals fruited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I continued collecting data for
storage time, fruit size, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: external characteristics that I was
seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in order to do any sort of genetic
study, we need to have genotypes of the
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this population was genotyped using
genome bi-sequencing, or GDS, and a
[SPEAKER_04]: collaboration between Cornell,
the USDA, and Dalhousie University.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was then aligned to the Golden
Delicious double haploid reference genome,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I used a principal component analysis
depicted here on the left to identify and
[SPEAKER_04]: remove any out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the two points on the far side of the
charts are the two parents, and the cloud
[SPEAKER_04]: in the center are all the progeny.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 22 out-crosses were identified and
discarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a further out-cross was found in
genotyping later on and was also discarded
[SPEAKER_04]: before analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The filter settings I have are there,
and it resulted in 51,442 sites,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is plenty for a genetic study.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my genetic analysis has been pretty
robust, which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first trait that I'm going to talk
about here is apple storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the first year of fruiting,
this population only had like 22
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals fruit in 2018 when I first got
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even in that small subset of
individuals, there was an apparent
[SPEAKER_04]: segregation of long-storing fruit that
stayed well in the cooler on par with
[SPEAKER_04]: malus domestica, and short-storing fruit,
some of which senesced on the tree,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some senesced very quickly in the
cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have quite an interest in reducing
food waste, and so I found this trait to
[SPEAKER_04]: be of great interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also important to note that since
this is an interspecific population,
[SPEAKER_04]: and because of what we know from
domestication studies in apple,
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit firmness and the ability to store
fruit appears to be a trait that we
[SPEAKER_04]: selected upon in the early days of
domestication and fruit breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so adding in this wild species gives a
kind of novel chance to look at some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these domestication genes and what we
should really consider as we're working
[SPEAKER_04]: towards using wild species in future apple
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my hypothesis is listed there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly, genetic differences are causing
differences in storage and phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then my questions are listed there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What genes are causing these differences?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are external biotic effects causing them,
and really what effects are these genes
[SPEAKER_04]: having on the fruit over storage time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Storage is intensely researched in apple,
and since apple is a clonally propagated
[SPEAKER_04]: crop, most of the research has been
focused on modifying the environment
[SPEAKER_04]: surrounding the fruit, whether in growing
or in storage, and not as much focus has
[SPEAKER_04]: been given on genetic causes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's mostly because once a cultivar
is released and becomes popular,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can't retract it to fix an issue in
storage, and so we work on modifying the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I really wanted to look into the
genetic causes of storage ability that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing in this population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, if you've been in any sort of
intro storage class, you see a ripening
[SPEAKER_04]: curve for climacteric fruit, which apple
is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the trends in respiration and
growth, as well as the interplay with
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene, which is a plant growth hormone
that is heavily tied to plants'
[SPEAKER_04]: respiration, plant growth, and then fruit
ripening.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this understanding, I then looked
into genes that have been previously
[SPEAKER_04]: identified in other studies in relation to
ethylene as well as storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ethylene biosynthesis pathway is
depicted here.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the genes of interest that I'm going
to talk about in blue, ACO and ACS have
[SPEAKER_04]: been identified in apple and somewhat well
characterized.
[SPEAKER_04]: These genes have been identified and known
to affect ethylene production over storage
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here's more information.
[SPEAKER_04]: ACO is located on chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the final step of ethylene
biosynthesis and has been associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: increased ethylene production.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a long time, ACO was considered like
not that much of a factor in storage,
[SPEAKER_04]: but more recent studies have indicated
that it is more of a rate-limiting step
[SPEAKER_04]: than previously thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: ACS is the first step in this two-step
pathway and has previously been reported
[SPEAKER_04]: as the rate-limiting step.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's located on chromosome 15 and also is
associated with increased ethylene
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, before I got into that,
I wanted to look to see if there were any
[SPEAKER_04]: biotic causes of these storage differences
in this population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So blue mold, which is a penicillium,
is the most number one, it's the number
[SPEAKER_04]: one post-harvest pathogen in apple
storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I created a subset of the
population, half of them being
[SPEAKER_04]: long-storing individuals that I had
tracked at least a year previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And half of them being short-storing
individuals and tested them for blue mold
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance by stabbing them with a nail
and putting penicillium inoculum into that
[SPEAKER_04]: wound and then placing them into an
inoculation chamber, also known as a large
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic totes with wet paper towels to
maintain humidity and ensure inoculation
[SPEAKER_04]: and sporulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, no complete resistance was
observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of the fruit did get infected with
blue mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And however, there was some slight
variation in time to sporulation,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not enough to be significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: As mentioned before, ethylene is very
important in fruit ripening and
[SPEAKER_04]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same subset was brought down here
to the Watkins lab with Joseph and Chris
[SPEAKER_04]: Watkins to be measured for internal
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a measurement of gas was taken from the
internal seed chamber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, no real pattern was found
between the two classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no pattern in long-storing and
short-storing.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this is likely due to the fact
that the fruits, there was ripeness
[SPEAKER_04]: differences in the fruits caused by its
intraspecific background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't use standardized ripening metrics
like starch, iodine, index, and
[SPEAKER_04]: penetrometers because the fruit are too
small for a penetrometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them will get crushed just by the
distance of penetration and variation in
[SPEAKER_04]: starch has been observed in some of the
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I couldn't reliably use starch iodine
index to quantify ripeness either.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also sometimes the seed chamber was
simply too small to accurately draw gas
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ethylene is still a mystery,
but blue mold is not the cause of this
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance or this storability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the three years of data,
I looked at segregation ratios and they
[SPEAKER_04]: are depicted here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are approximately 50% or one to one
segregation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked at the segregation ratio,
which suggests a single large effect gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I then ran a genetic association
using TASL and then R to plot the results,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are displayed here as a Manhattan
plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see there's a very clear and
strong peak located on chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this peak co-locates with the region
that has been associated with ACO.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to see if anything else was going on,
I then genotyped the two parents for ACS
[SPEAKER_04]: and ACO, the two genes involved in the
ethylene biosynthesis pathway,
[SPEAKER_04]: and found that in ACS, both parents near
columnar one and pronifolia were
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous for the long storing or the low
ethylene producing alleles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ACS does not seem to be of any effect
here, which makes sense since we did not
[SPEAKER_04]: see any peak on chromosome 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, ACO, the malice domestic parent,
New York columnar one, has the two low
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene producing genes, but in
pronifolia, it has one copy of the low
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene producing and one copy of the
high ethylene producing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This means that the progeny will be
segregating a one-to-one ratio between
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous, low ethylene producing,
and heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one copy of low ethylene and one copy
of high ethylene producing, which also
[SPEAKER_04]: validates this Manhattan plot,
this genetic association.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to understand what was kind
of going on in this population or in
[SPEAKER_04]: storage over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I outlined an RNA-seq experiment
that used four long storing individuals,
[SPEAKER_04]: which included the long storing parents,
and four short storing individuals,
[SPEAKER_04]: which included the short storing parent,
which was pronifolia, and had collection
[SPEAKER_04]: dates that were connected over
physiological time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in short storing, there was three time
points that were measured, initial time at
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest, the midpoint, and then right
before senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in long storing, there was five
time points that were collected,
[SPEAKER_04]: which had all of those plus two additional
harvest time points just to further give
[SPEAKER_04]: clarification on that gene expression
curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these individuals in the study
were also validated with their genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the short storing individuals had the
heterozygous genotypes at ACO,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the long storing individuals had the
homozygous low storing or low ethylene
[SPEAKER_04]: producing genes at ACO.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just kind of the workflow of the
RNA-seq that I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It resulted in an average number of reads
being over 3 million, the percent of
[SPEAKER_04]: uniquely mapped reads being at 81.43%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had 30,000 out of 52,000 of the
total annotations that were mapped to the
[SPEAKER_04]: peel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to take tissue samples of the
peel because it has been shown to be more
[SPEAKER_04]: biosynthetically active than the rest of
the fruit during storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the fruit tissue itself contains
lots of sugars, which cause problems for
[SPEAKER_04]: RNA extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: These numbers are a little bit low for a
lot of RNA-seq experiments, but for a
[SPEAKER_04]: three prime profiling experiment,
which is that's what this is, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: sufficient to give us an idea and
indication of what is happening over
[SPEAKER_04]: storage and time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from those reads, a PCA was made to
demonstrate the separation between classes
[SPEAKER_04]: and see if unsupervised WGCNA was able to
be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you can see across PCA1,
which is the bottom, there is pretty good
[SPEAKER_04]: separation over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So early collections mapped on the right
side of that chart and later collections
[SPEAKER_04]: mapped on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then across PCA2, we can see a pretty
clear separation between the classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, long-storing individuals are
blue and short-storing individuals are
[SPEAKER_04]: red.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this gave us indication that we could
use unsupervised WGCNA, which then created
[SPEAKER_04]: this cluster chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color names on the left sides of these
boxes don't really mean anything other
[SPEAKER_04]: than names of the clusters, so you can
ignore that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are groups of eigen genes that
appear to be associated with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So red means that genes in the clusters
are positively correlated with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as eigen gene expression of them go up,
other eigen genes also go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue is negatively associated,
so same pattern in reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the contrast of this was between the
two classes, so long and short,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the different columns here are
grouped.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just comparing between long and short
individuals, time, which was days,
[SPEAKER_04]: then each accession had different storage
lengths because they were matched to their
[SPEAKER_04]: individual senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then time group, which was the 0.25,
0.5, 0.75, and full senescence discussed
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from that, these clusters were then
made to demonstrate eigen gene expression
[SPEAKER_04]: patterns over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the y-axis is the modeled eigen gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: Higher means higher expression,
lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the chart means lower expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the x is just that time point
series.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, the short individuals
in red only have three collection points,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the long individuals have five.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have these two highlighted just to
demonstrate kind of what this sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: output tells us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the far right, we have turquoise and
blue, which you see that the two classes
[SPEAKER_04]: appear to be relatively similar in shape
across time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can assume that that is standard
biological process in storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm not going to be looking in that
cluster for anything because they're both
[SPEAKER_04]: going through similar expression levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the left side, we have yellow
and green, which have quite different
[SPEAKER_04]: levels, similar shapes, but different
quantities of eigen gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yellow and green might be an area
that I would look into for some causal
[SPEAKER_04]: genes or some pathways of what could be
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's all of the clusters that I
could potentially look into.
[SPEAKER_04]: The parentheses indicate how many genes
are located inside that cluster.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some are quite large at 41,000,
and some are quite small at 65.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we don't want to just rely on
these algorithmically decided expression
[SPEAKER_04]: patterns in order to explain what we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that information and with the
association that I have discussed
[SPEAKER_04]: previously, I looked into the annotation
files that were available for
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene-related genes, and I found over
300 genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that included transcription factors,
pathways, signaling path repressors,
[SPEAKER_04]: and synthesis pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that 300, there were 30 that were
differentially expressed in this pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were distributed across seven of
those previously pointed out modules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from those 30, I found some of the
most highly differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So log fold over 1.8 and a p-value over
0.005.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there, I went back to this
biosynthesis pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see again, ACS and ECO
there are the ones that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I looked at ACS.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, again, has no segregation in the
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the gene expression or the transcript
expression of that gene is not
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly different than between long
storing and short storing, which you would
[SPEAKER_04]: expect, because there's no genetic
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: In ACO, which we know there's a genetic
difference, we would expect there to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: different expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, there's no significant
difference between the two classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to point out here that
the causal mutation that causes the low
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene producing and high ethylene
producing phenotypes at ACO do not change
[SPEAKER_04]: the transcript level.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a functional mutation, a missense
mutation that causes the protein resulting
[SPEAKER_04]: from the transcript to function less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wouldn't actually expect any
transcription or transcriptional
[SPEAKER_04]: differences at ACO.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we going to look at now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that doesn't make sense anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I looked at other associated genes and
other associated proteins and found this
[SPEAKER_04]: gene, SAMDC.
[SPEAKER_04]: SAM is a pretty ubiquitous protein in
biosynthetic pathways and in ripening.
[SPEAKER_04]: The DC is decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always have to look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decarboxylase.
[SPEAKER_04]: But SAMDC has been shown in ripening
studies to be upregulated by the
[SPEAKER_04]: perception of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So SAM is increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: The expression of SAMDC is increased when
the fruit or the tissue is receiving
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene and starting the biosynthesis
pathway again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here, we do see a significant
difference between the two classes,
[SPEAKER_04]: where long storing individuals have quite
a bit less transcription of the SAMDC gene
[SPEAKER_04]: and short storing individuals have an
increasing expression of it over time,
[SPEAKER_04]: which makes sense because in theory,
ACO is producing more ethylene in short
[SPEAKER_04]: storing individuals and long storing
individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fruit are responding to this
higher ethylene concentration around them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to look more into this, I then looked
at the ethylene receptor and sensor genes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which do similar things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sense ethylene and then start the
ethylene senescence pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in both of these cases here,
we see a difference between short storing
[SPEAKER_04]: and long storing individuals, with long
storing being significantly lower than
[SPEAKER_04]: short storing individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And continuing on that, these are ethylene
response factors, which they are genes
[SPEAKER_04]: that get turned on when the senescence
pathway that is controlled by ethylene
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of overproduces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they try to repress that pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would, again, expect these to be
higher expressed in tissues that are
[SPEAKER_04]: sensing increased levels of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have highlighted here this response
factor on chromosome 15 that you can see a
[SPEAKER_04]: very clear difference between the two
types.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here on chromosome 12,
on the side of the screen, there are also
[SPEAKER_04]: two other ethylene response factors that
show a difference between the two classes
[SPEAKER_04]: of fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really wanted to highlight this one
at the top because the long storing
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals have almost no transcription
of this ethylene response factor while the
[SPEAKER_04]: short ones have transcription of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to kind of wrap everything up together,
the biotic factors that I looked at,
[SPEAKER_04]: blue mold and internal ethylene really
didn't give a lot of clarity, but I was
[SPEAKER_04]: able to map an association that co-locates
with the ACO region over three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when looking at the RNAseq data,
we see that the fruit itself is responding
[SPEAKER_04]: to an increased level of ethylene that is
caused by the ACO gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is backed up by the SAMDC gene as
well as the receptors and response genes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are higher transcribed in the short
storing individuals and lower transcribed
[SPEAKER_04]: in the long storing individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, just to reiterate,
this is of interest and importance in
[SPEAKER_04]: interspecific breeding because we need to
do some interspecific breeding to
[SPEAKER_04]: integrate new traits, but we don't really
know what negative traits are being
[SPEAKER_04]: brought in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this could be something that we
have to pay attention to as we do that
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to try to quickly go through
stuff because I only have five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in apple, acidity is one thing that has
been researched quite intensely.
[SPEAKER_04]: MA1 and MA3 are two genes that are
reported to control the majority of malic
[SPEAKER_04]: acid accumulation in malice.
[SPEAKER_04]: MA1 is reported on chromosome 16 and MA3
is on chromosome 8.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right, there's a very short list of
other genes reported to influence malic
[SPEAKER_04]: acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is plenty more beyond that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will just be talking about MA1 and MA3
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this population, there's quite a
distribution between acidity between the
[SPEAKER_04]: two parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is data from 2021, though the
patterns for this hold true over all years
[SPEAKER_04]: observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that New York Clominar 1
has significantly lower acidity than
[SPEAKER_04]: malice pronifolia.
[SPEAKER_04]: CO1 comes in at 3.27 grams per liter of
titratable acidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pronifolia comes in at 24.44 grams per
liter, which just for reference,
[SPEAKER_04]: apples are kind of thought to be somewhere
between like five and 10 grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: titratable acidity per liter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So New York Clominar 1 is actually
significantly lower acidity than kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: standard apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pronifolia is quite a bit high,
screamingly high acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the progeny fall within these two
parents every single year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great candidate for genetic
association.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the knowledge of these two genes,
the population was genotyped for MA1 and
[SPEAKER_04]: Clominar 1 was found to be homozygous
dominant, which would indicate that it has
[SPEAKER_04]: a high acid phenotype, which doesn't quite
make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pronifolia was found to be heterozygous,
meaning it has one high acid allele and
[SPEAKER_04]: one low acid allele.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from that, we would expect a
segregation ratio of one to one of
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous dominant and heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we find an actual segregation
ratio of one to 1.58.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is due to that lethality gene
that I mentioned at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_04]: that is linked to MA1.
[SPEAKER_04]: MA3 was also genotyped and CO1 was found
to be homozygous recessive, meaning it has
[SPEAKER_04]: a low acid genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pronifolia was found to be
heterozygous with one copy of high acid
[SPEAKER_04]: and one copy of low acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we would expect a segregation
ratio of one to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is what we observed in the
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that, I again did a genetic
association using TASL and GLM and found
[SPEAKER_04]: this peak located on chromosome 8,
which co-locates with the MA3 region.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is interesting to report, though,
that we really don't see the peak on
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome 16 that we would expect with
MA1.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do see it slightly in the pH chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that peak is inconsistent over years,
and it's never found in the titratable
[SPEAKER_04]: acidity even over all three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shows up in pH two out of three
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to point out, again,
the ranges of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Titratable acidity goes from 3 to 24,
and pH goes from 2.6 to 4.8.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a lot easier to create false
associations without that granularity of
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from that, it brings up the
question of what is going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The primary acid in malice is malic acid,
which we assume is about 95 or upwards of
[SPEAKER_04]: 95%.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's been found in wild species
that secondary acids, such as citric acid,
[SPEAKER_04]: accounts for up to 60% of the acid
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to check if citric acid is what's
causing this wide discrepancy in acidity,
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to measure citric acid or the
acidity profile and do associations with
[SPEAKER_04]: specific acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, I tried an enzymatic assay,
which was inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I then moved to HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in HPLC, I found no signal or it was
an unreliable signal that I could not
[SPEAKER_04]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I sent a small subset to LaLing to
check for or to use GCMS to check for
[SPEAKER_04]: citric acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was no citric acid signal
observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a wide variation in malic
acid in the subset, which validates the
[SPEAKER_04]: high distribution that I was showing
earlier and also accounts or informs us
[SPEAKER_04]: that the majority of this acid is malic
acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can assume other acids are not
really playing a part.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, the acidity profile is not
due to these secondary acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know that MA3 controls the majority
of acid expression in this population,
[SPEAKER_04]: which kind of indicates that MA1 seems to
be non-functioning in this population or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's under repression.
[SPEAKER_04]: New York CO1 has high acid alleles,
homozygous dominant for the high acid,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the lowest acid phenotype in this
entire population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a bit outside of this
dissertation work, but in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: identify kind of what's going on or give
indication in conversations with Dr. Susan
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown, she mentioned that MA3 seems to
control majority of the acid in her
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so MA1 could be sequenced to identify
potential allelic variations that have
[SPEAKER_04]: lower expression or lower controls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we could identify the source of
that allelic variation to see if it's
unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it unique to the populations here or
unique to some of the background of New
[SPEAKER_04]: York CO1?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, and I'm going to try to speed
through this so I don't go away over time,
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I measured all of these traits,
but I'm really only going to report on
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit size today because it has a clearer
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I measured fruit size as fruit height,
fruit diameter, and fruit mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here are the distributions for 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2021, which again, had just the most
robust data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm reporting on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see again that the parents are
on each side of the chart with New York
[SPEAKER_04]: Clumnar1 being the large fruited one and
Prunifolia being one of the smallest or
[SPEAKER_04]: the smallest in the population with a
distribution of progeny between the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using that data, I created another
genetic association with these three
[SPEAKER_04]: traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly, we found peaks on
chromosome 13 in both diameter and height
[SPEAKER_04]: that used or the peaks were located at the
same snip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 17,6952.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the peak that is on chromosome 13 in
mass is very nearby the snip as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is of note because no fruit size loci
have been identified on chromosome 13 for
[SPEAKER_04]: apple yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also peaks identified in this
association on chromosome 5 for fruit
[SPEAKER_04]: height, chromosome 2 for fruit diameter,
and chromosome 3 for fruit mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So briefly in summary, I talked a lot
about fruit storage and what is going on
[SPEAKER_04]: behind the scenes over storage time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I presented a wide variety in fruit
acidity and genetic associations and
[SPEAKER_04]: controls in this population, and then also
presented some data on fruit size.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of this together kind of tells a
story of using interspecific breeding and
[SPEAKER_04]: apple breeding and also traits that could
be paid attention to as we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also somewhat goes against the
standard idea of interspecific apple
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding, which is that all interspecific
hybrids are small fruited and high in
[SPEAKER_04]: tannins, high in acidity, low in sugar,
all these negative traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this project kind of tells a story
that in interspecific apple breeding with
[SPEAKER_04]: careful parental selection and some
patience, you are able to really get some
[SPEAKER_04]: decent sized and decent tasting apples
after one generation that could be then
[SPEAKER_04]: used in future breeding with some of these
useful traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be remiss to not acknowledge all the
people that have helped in this project
[SPEAKER_04]: and in my research, namely Dr. Susan Brown
and Kevin Maloney in the apple breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: lab in Geneva, who their mentorship has
been invaluable to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of my collaborators, my committee
members, the current lab that I'm in in
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva with Jason Alondo, and then the
grape breeding lab, which have been great
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and collaborators, and my funding
through Polar Grant and Chimichang Novak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then none of this happens in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to thank and acknowledge all
of my friends and family that have
[SPEAKER_04]: supported me through all this and kept me
sane as I'm staring at apples for 16 hours
[SPEAKER_04]: a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I think I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So storage is a human construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, in these wild populations,
you're finding variation in genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: impact storage, which one that existed
when they were evolving and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what nature is selecting for some of
these differences in genetic traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: are shown up in storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the selection pressure in nature
when you're looking at these wild species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an optimal time for these apples
to hang on a tree before they're consumed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, storage is a human
construct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so during domestication, how were
these storage-related genes selected upon?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the answer is, they weren't
necessarily selected on for storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were selected for the ethylene
senescence effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this population, some of these trees
senesce on the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you think in nature,
those senescing, rotting fruits are not
[SPEAKER_04]: very useful to animals because they're
breaking down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sugars are breaking down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The starches are gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as animals were consuming them,
they likely selected for ones that did not
[SPEAKER_04]: rot immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the seeds spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as humans moved them along the
Silk Road, probably something more akin to
[SPEAKER_04]: storage was selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, how were the classes
defined between short- and long-storing?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the long-storing individuals were
basically identified as staying sound in
[SPEAKER_04]: storage from harvest, which is September,
October, until discard and cleaning,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was April, May.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so not as long as apples can be
stored.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the short-storing individuals all
senesced within three months of harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was a pretty clear separation
between those two different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the storage temperature?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kept at 4C, so pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that question was just what was the
storage temperature?
Carol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of curiosity, did you taste any
of the apples?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted almost all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are awful and hurt your mouth
to consume, as Hongrei can attest to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some are actually quite pleasant with
pretty good texture, sweetness,
[SPEAKER_04]: and acidity that, you know, is very
similar to a commercial apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, some are very high tannic and
high acidity, and so they hurt your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of questions, just comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the ML1, I think you can look at
their genetic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their inter allele interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For both ML1 and ML3, they are dominant
genes for high acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your population, you have a
homologous high acid for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: New York CO1?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, for CO1, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other parent is you have a
heterozygote, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yep, heterozygote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means your population will not
surrogate for ML1 in terms of their acid
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're controlled by that, by ML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the effect of ML1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you're saying that because of
the dominant acid allele that can come
[SPEAKER_04]: from either parents, that we would not see
a difference in expression?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just their functionality things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we could potentially do an allele
expression difference with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for the ML3, that's the perfect
because you have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them are heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see them surrogate, and then you
see the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that explains your data very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to hang around, and I'm sure
there's more things back there to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
