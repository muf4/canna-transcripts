[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the introduction,
Dr. Crossovich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say good afternoon to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank the Plant Breeding and
Genetics Seminar Committee and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chairman for this opportunity to present
on the activities of the Innovation Lab
[SPEAKER_00]: for Crop Improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a snippet of what I'm going to
talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give us a brief background of
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go ahead and introduce you all
to the Innovation Lab for Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to round up by talking about
our Centers of Innovation, which I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: is the heartbeat of ELSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who do not know me,
I am originally from Nigeria, just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: was introduced by Dr. Crossovich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first introduction to plant science
research was through IIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was where I received inspiration,
actually, to pursue a career in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that encounter, my family
routinely processed cassava to make gari
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves just for personal consumption,
not to take it to the market or any
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the men would have us cassava,
and the women were tasked to turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava into gari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would peel and process into gari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a short leave because of the
death in the family, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the breadwinner died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then life, especially feeding for,
you know, I have, I was just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 year old, feeding became very
difficult, you know, and a child,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does a child know rather than to eat
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a point in my life where I
witnessed poverty, you know, firsthand and
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all the while I craved,
I desired to find a solution to this
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because children shouldn't have
to worry about, you know, where their next
[SPEAKER_00]: meal is going to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not knowing, you know, I would end up
working in crop improvement research and
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this encounter, I was privileged
to serve again in IT that I was able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with IT about tech at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now called the IT about science
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: After which I was inspired to continue in
plant research to obtain a master's in
[SPEAKER_00]: crop protection and pursued my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, I did the molecular biology
work at the Max Planck Institute for Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Greening Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the cassava transformation work
at SEAD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the theme was a proof of concept that
genes from Arabidopsis thaliana can
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate flowering in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we all know, cassava is
recalcitrant to flowering and flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: very important for breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research was so interesting that
we had flowers, we have cassava in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: plant flowering, cassava flowering in
vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to prove that the FT of
expression increases the prolificacy of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering production and extends the
longevity of flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also characterized the components of
the circadian clock upstream of the FT in
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I obtained my PhD from the
University of Cologne, I tried to secure a
[SPEAKER_00]: position in the African continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by divine providence, I found my way
to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came to Texas, where I began my
immigration journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where I studied the mechanisms
by which legume plants, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: modicago truncatella control symbiotic
nitrogen fixation, acquiring nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: without the use of energetically and
monetarily expensive and pollutant
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, we would search for mutant
lines in our Roberts Noble Foundation is
[SPEAKER_00]: close by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mutant we found showed
nitrogen deficiency syndrome symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: rather, the mutant fails to form pink
nitrogen fixing nodules that occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type symbiosis, but instead,
it develops small bomb like nodules on its
[SPEAKER_00]: route that are blocked at an early stage
of development and lateral and has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral root defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the functional leap like D gene was
cloned and shown to encode a protein in
[SPEAKER_00]: the broad substrate nitrate reductase
transporter family and the neat,
[SPEAKER_00]: legit, neat, neat, la de lateral route
deficient transporter is essential for
[SPEAKER_00]: modulation and appropriate and appropriate
route architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is some of the publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that experience, I came to
Cornell, where I worked with Tim Setter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continued, you know, came back to
working with Cassava after that detour on
[SPEAKER_00]: overexpressing ribidopsis Ft that elicits
extremely early flowering indicated that
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava has the necessary signaling
components to interact with and respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ft gene product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my work was to advance my work was to
advance our understanding of the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: and physiological basis of flowering in
Cassava under different environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions where I investigated the
expression of Cassava Ft-like genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We characterized the phosphatidyl ethanol
amine-biting protein family of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens that in Cassava,
we have 10 of them and we identified like
[SPEAKER_00]: a putative Ft-like homolog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ft-like is like in a ribidopsis is the
rate limiting gene that is responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: switching from vegetative to reproductive
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared the expression of this
homologs in various tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we elucidated the expression of this
homologs in various experimentally
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled for the period and temperature
environment in relation to the effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava regulation and other important
roles in Cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to advance the potential
for applications in breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we found out that,
I mean, in some of the assertions that we
[SPEAKER_00]: used, the Cassava is a long day if flowers
early on the long day for the period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put them in short day,
the flower eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I rounded up my research,
my postdoctoral experience, I was serving
[SPEAKER_00]: on the board of the Cornell BEST program.
[SPEAKER_00]: BEST used to be called Broadening
Experiences in Scientific Training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now known as Careers Beyond
Academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a platform where PhD students and
postdocs can like find a fulfilling career
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like your test driving,
you know, different career options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even those who pursue academic careers
will need to develop skills beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical or research skills they're
developing in their current programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BEST provides opportunities for
increasing awareness of the broad range of
[SPEAKER_00]: careers that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And examples are like in policy making,
governance, risk and compliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, entrepreneurship and management,
communication and research administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I now found myself in the Office
of the Vice Provost for Research and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Office of the Vice Provost for Academic
Integration, it was a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for me where I learned more
about research administration,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell leadership, compliance issues,
the Office of the Sponsor Programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: RIA, worked on special projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with our research division,
communications and CTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later I administered a startup incubator
for commercialization of Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: technology ventures in engineering,
digital and physical sciences called
[SPEAKER_00]: Praxis Center, just like Dr. Kresowich
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I managed the diverse administrative
functions of six independent venture teams
[SPEAKER_00]: with up to 50 individual client team
members rested in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who don't know Praxis
Center, it's like a sister center to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin McGovern Center, which is a startup
incubator for commercialization of Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: life sciences technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, when this current
position came up, I became excited and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to take on this challenge inspired
really by the potential impact that this
[SPEAKER_00]: work that the Innovation Lab is doing
could have not only on the African
[SPEAKER_00]: continent, but also on millions of people
around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that this is a perfect
opportunity for me to fulfill that desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found myself having a career
trajectory that starts with research and
[SPEAKER_00]: continues with a large ag research grant
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me to, you'll see,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about Innovation Lab for
corporate improvement, we cannot talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about Innovation Lab for corporate
improvement without talking about the Fit
[SPEAKER_00]: the Future and the global food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Fit the Future is a US government
initiative to sustainably reduce global
[SPEAKER_00]: hunger, malnutrition and poverty through
agriculture led economic growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: to strengthen our resilience and improve
human nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is led by the USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a global food security act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's implemented by the global
food security strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the US partners that are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US government agencies and departments
are involved in this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Fit the Future has 12 target
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the implementing partners are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these implementing partners are
research funding organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're innovators and development
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that there are about 21
countries in Fit the Future Innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs that ranges on topics about animal
science, research, to policy, food policy
[SPEAKER_00]: and to plant research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ELSI was previously there are
innovation labs that specifically deal or
[SPEAKER_00]: work on specific crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ELSI is working on a broad range
of crop with a global impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was awarded, it was a competition
and Cornell was awarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are excited that Cornell was awarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five year effective last year and
the award amount is $25 million and to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a crop improvement portfolio for
the NARIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is our mission?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to partner with national
programs to identify, help them identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop, pilot and transfer appropriate
tools, technologies and methods to equip
[SPEAKER_00]: them so they can deliver increased genetic
gain for better seeds into the markets for
[SPEAKER_00]: smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ultimately reduce malnutrition and
hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically, donor organizations will
provide funding for research, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: drive the goals and priorities for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in ELSI,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this bottom up approach where the
NARIs drive the goals and priorities for
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we believe that sustainable
solutions will have a long term effect if
[SPEAKER_00]: the NARIs specifically identify their
unique needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And target innovations or design
innovations to solve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focus on providing resources in
terms of cutting edge science and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration and all that they need that
we believe that will help them to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is our tactic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our tactics include this core
interdisciplinary team of scientists that
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on priority setting, you know,
of breeding interventions that will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the responsiveness of this
interventions and potentially improve
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake of new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a trade discovery team,
genomics, phenomics, breeding informatics
[SPEAKER_00]: and institutional capacity evaluation that
we believe are the core, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: core research areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them area of inquiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are essential for success in the
NARIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is like the sketch that talks
about the area of inquiry, deploying
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, technology and methods through a
breeding pipeline for a healthy crop
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take you quickly through the
management team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Dr. Kresovish Hawley as our
associate director and Munifa as our
[SPEAKER_00]: program assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the team of
communications support and administrative
[SPEAKER_00]: and event personnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a brief, going through the area of
inquiry team leads to faces behind
[SPEAKER_00]: tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our core area of inquiry team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Jeff Morris from Colorado
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Jesse Pollan from Kansas State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Dio Tavaragia from Clemson
University that works on phenomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of our team are all Cornell
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a cross-cutting team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that we have a cross-cutting
team lead, just a designated lead in
[SPEAKER_00]: Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Dee and Margaret also working
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cross-cutting team is very
important in that it's about increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness and understanding of the
importance of addressing and incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: gender, youth, nutrition, and resilience
in crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highlight two things that the
cross-cutting team have done so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is training and translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to COVID, we're just talking about
COVID-19, it has been difficult to travel
[SPEAKER_00]: in person with the rising number of
infected cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel restrictions were probably not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cross-cutting team, they have
designed outline and online sensitization
[SPEAKER_00]: training to reach our COIs more quickly
than would have been in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their work could continue despite the
travel restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a very great idea
that they have initiated two trainings
[SPEAKER_00]: already in gender and youth to serve as a
framework for additional two trainings in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trainings will also serve as a
public tools, accessible by any way,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as templates for the other area of
encourage whom we wish to pursue the same
[SPEAKER_00]: for their own area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other accomplishment that we have
that they have done is that we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the centers of innovation,
I'm going to talk about later,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are awarded in countries that are
primarily non-English speaking or they
[SPEAKER_00]: speak English as part of its colonial
heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have stated that the objective of
the ELC includes diversity and inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have reinforced those through our
strategic management and prioritization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-cutting themes throughout the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are working to formalize access.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I must say also that I just read
an email that was sent to one of our COIs
[SPEAKER_00]: in Senegal in French.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm impressed that we are working so
much to make sure that ELC succeeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that means that we want to
translate the work to remove any
[SPEAKER_00]: communication gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're working to formalize access to
translation and all interpretation
[SPEAKER_00]: services to support inclusive outreach and
capacity building for the cross-cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: theme, as well as the ELC team and
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just go through our advisory
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our advisory committee, they are seasoned
professionals with international
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in leading research and
development in the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is linked with a private
sector in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together, we believe that our core
team, area of inquiry leads and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-cutting team together with the
management entity will leverage these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to engage efforts that connect
with private sector priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can ensure technology and method
advancements and transfer them to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: our married partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it takes me to our target crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our target crops are root tubers and
bananas, legumes, excluding soybean and
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have millet and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also talk about the quick
wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the quick wings?
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick wings were identified as
short-term projects with a moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: investment and for a long-term impact and
were identified at the time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal was submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have quick wing partners in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one in Haiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one in Nepal and one in Senegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quick wing in Uganda, one of the
quick wings in Uganda is working on weevil
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance with potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick wing, another quick wing in Uganda
is working on fast cooking, iron and zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: bifurcate being using genomic selection
pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our Nepal quick wing is working on
high protein quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lentil using non-destructive typing tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our quick wing in Senegal is working
on staggering and drought resistant pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: millet using quantitative treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using back-cross nested associated
mapping, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our quick wing in Haiti is working to
increase the rate of genetic gain in
[SPEAKER_00]: low-budget developing countries' sorghum
breeding program using genomic assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would share some of the progress he
has made so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his product for profile is trigger
cane aphid resistant multipurpose sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works on a point proof of concept to
demonstrate the possibility of enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic gains in sorghum with rapid
cycling genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has several genomic cycles from
trigger cane aphid resistant multipurpose
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum with broad adaptation to tropical
growth environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he went to genomic cycles
selection three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she selected families with yields
exceeding the yield of the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: recurrent selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best breeds from this genomic
selection cycles and phenotypic recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: selection cycle are currently under
multi-location trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the genomic selection
cycle three, which is under a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, water stress and severe aphid
infestation yield, it had increased in
[SPEAKER_00]: green yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to continue some work to
validate new varieties in participatory
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to validate ID types and
evaluate new training set for more
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about our centers of
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they are the heartbeat of the
ELSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, to identify the centers
of innovation, we requested for an
[SPEAKER_00]: application because our goal is to build
the top tier scalable breeding programs
[SPEAKER_00]: and co-create a toolbox package covering
all the six areas of inquiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a goal to select one NARI in
each region, the East African region,
[SPEAKER_00]: the West African region, and the Southeast
Asia region, and the Latin American
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the requirement was that they write a
proposal for projects for three years and
[SPEAKER_00]: define clearly the product profiles for
target crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RFA will impact, it must be led by
NARIs in the feed the future countries and
[SPEAKER_00]: they should articulate the development
goal and clearly indicate how becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: COI will increase benefits for women,
youth, climate resilience, and nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: still on the global food security strategy
three objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the budget is a maximum of a million
and entities that date was October 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year priority was given to
institutions that have linkages with the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: minorities of an institution, the minority
group of women and early career
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, and also essential that they
partner with NARIs, universities and
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions and CGR centers and proposal
should be submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an advantage is if it's submitted by
interdisciplinary groups of PIs and they
[SPEAKER_00]: should include capacity building plans
that is articulated at the individual and
[SPEAKER_00]: institutional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their product profiles should
address gender, youth based constraint,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they should show potential for all
these three global food security strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RFA process, the RFA process was
guided by the written questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the webinar we had about 150
registrants from 41 countries and the
[SPEAKER_00]: letters of intent, it's the letters of
intent were submitted by 104 applicants
[SPEAKER_00]: across 26 countries and we filtered those
104 applications to about 40 using
[SPEAKER_00]: different criteria if they followed,
if you were going to research in Amanda
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop or have NARI PI or the countries
eligible and all the supporting documents
[SPEAKER_00]: and 12 was shortlisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the co-creation phase we merged out
of those two shortlisted candidates,
[SPEAKER_00]: we merged two of the projects together and
then there was like a matrix of calls for
[SPEAKER_00]: the area of NKRI and the cross-cutting
teams, team leaders to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare the proposal to reflect all the
priorities of ELSI in the areas of NKRI
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cross-cutting team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had 10 final proposal that was
submitted and four was granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: These four are Costa Rica 80, these are
the ones that emerged and the one from
[SPEAKER_00]: Senegal and Uganda and Malawi,
we have already worked with 80 in Senegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting to work or have
footprints in the global spectrum and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are also working to include in work in
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the centers are the Central America and
Caribbean Crop Improvement Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: CASIA, the Center of Innovation for Crop
Improvement for East and Southern Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: CCSR is in Malawi with Michael Cepeda and
the East African Center of Innovation for
[SPEAKER_00]: Fingermilk and Sorghum in person of Kivya
Adikini at the National Center on Rite
[SPEAKER_00]: Resources Research Institute in Canada and
we have Crop Improvement Innovation in
[SPEAKER_00]: West Africa and that's in person of Kido.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Central America, the CASIA is led
by Josie and Gail and NARI is Instituto
[SPEAKER_00]: Nacional de Innovación en Transferencia y
Tecnología Agupacaria Inter and Cascaia
[SPEAKER_00]: University and their crops are common
beans, sorghum and sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have the year they're set out to
work on their year plan is they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: validate product profiles in Costa Rica in
80 and they want to test uniform regional
[SPEAKER_00]: nosaries using participatory approaches
and expand the sorghum rapid recurrent and
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection approaches both in Costa
Rica and 80 because Gail is already
[SPEAKER_00]: working on sorghum and also they want to
incorporate physiological breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the beans, the crop they want to
begin the magic population development and
[SPEAKER_00]: for their sweet potato they will work on
rapid recurrent selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other, the second Center of
Innovation I'm going to talk about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: East African Center of Innovation for
Fingermilk and Sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead country is Uganda and we have
partner countries in Karo and Tari and the
[SPEAKER_00]: crops are common beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're going to work on is
sorghum and finger millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plan that Skovia has for this year
is that she wants to conduct a finger
[SPEAKER_00]: millet and sorghum value chain and do
market analysis to document the drivers
[SPEAKER_00]: for adoption of technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then she wants to identify sources
of resistance to some stresses and also
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional quality sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to do gene and molecular market
discovery for novel traits and develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize tools and methods for efficient
phenotyping and rapid regeneration and
[SPEAKER_00]: advancement of desirable traits and
digitize breeding programs for targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is very important because we
know that having the right tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies and methods, they would be
able to execute this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also wants to be like an
irrigation system because I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's a semi-arid area so they lack
these droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have more, to expand the nurseries
they need to be able to keep the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are one of the main major
investments that we are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next crop center of innovation is
the Crop Innovation in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: See why it's led by Guido and the PI,
co-PI is Marame and we have affiliated
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in Burkina Faso, Inera and Inrad
in Niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crops they're working on is per
millet, sorghum and cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have set out to do in year one
is to update their existing breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: product profiles to seek to understand
adoption differences and improve market
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility for the sorghum,
the per millet and cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to implement more than CTMs
for rapid discovery and validation of
[SPEAKER_00]: traits for genetic gain and product
concept development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also wants to use some genomic
selection and whole genome prediction of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop breeding values using simulation and
GS pipelines for optimizing the West
[SPEAKER_00]: African breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is going to do this using modernized
phenotyping and data capture platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of breeding pipelines and ultimately
digitize breeding activities and fair data
[SPEAKER_00]: and that face the capacity of
computational systems to assess,
[SPEAKER_00]: to find, assess and to operate and reuse
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the last center is a center of
innovation for crop improvement for East
[SPEAKER_00]: and Southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is led by Michael Chipeta,
who is the principal investigator and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jessica is a co-PI in Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the partner countries are Mozambique
and Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are located in Lungwe University
of Agriculture and Natural Resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're working on cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is here one plan is to conduct
gender-sensitive cowpea value chain
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is more of designing study tools
and framework for comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: gender-sensitive cowpea value chain
analysis using questionnaires and
[SPEAKER_00]: checklists and conduct trait preference
surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is going to characterize phenotypic
and genomic diversity cowpea genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: genoplasm, phenotype selected genoplasm or
breeding lines and collect for key traits
[SPEAKER_00]: in multiple sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is going to genotype some of the cowpea
genoplasm and the sequence cowpea founder
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and just like some nutrition variety
profiling and under developing and
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting more productive and nutritious
cowpea lines it will, it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting like the best parental lines for
generating crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I include the capacity development
here as an important part of our work in
[SPEAKER_00]: ILC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that they develop capacity
so that they can self sustain and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to change train on deployment and
implementation of EMS in Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to train on gender responsive
breeding and train on genomics enabled
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that they lack all these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the targets and you
want to ultimately train post-graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students and project personnel who can
continue to work in these three countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have this capacity,
institutional development, they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: self reliant or to continue to sustain
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think that's very,
very important part of their year one
[SPEAKER_00]: plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I have come to the end of
my talk and I'm excited that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this different regions because
I believe that ELC is strategically
[SPEAKER_00]: positioned to deploy crop improvement
research to the NARI's and one of the take
[SPEAKER_00]: homes is that NARI is our brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working for the NARI's so that they
can be self reliant, they can self
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain, they can breathe their own crops
just so that they can eliminate food
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that our COIs and quick win
research will accelerate breeding of
[SPEAKER_00]: locally and regionally adapted crop
varieties that target smallholder farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and other seed systems related outreach so
that their work and their products can be
[SPEAKER_00]: received.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end users and families and people
that need the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, of course, that's the
ultimate goal to advance and fulfill the
[SPEAKER_00]: three global food security strategy,
which is economic growth, resilience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and human nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this, I'd like to thank our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Kansas State Clemson and our COIs and
I've come to the end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
