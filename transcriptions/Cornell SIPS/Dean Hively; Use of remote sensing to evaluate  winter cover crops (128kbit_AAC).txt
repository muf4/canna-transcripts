[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So greetings, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with a combination of
USDA Ag Research Service and US Geological
[SPEAKER_01]: Survey in the Chesapeake Bay for about 12
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finished my PhD up at Cornell 12 years
ago and headed on down and started working
[SPEAKER_01]: on remote sensing of winter cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate this kind of a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great conference because it
allows the folks who've got their fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dirt doing field experiments to
interact with kind of the big picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening in the landscape with
implementation trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been working in a few different
states to try to work those things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking forward to the interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole slew of partners working
with soil conservation districts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a project in New York I'll be
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Susquehanna, a project with Sir Dicker in
Pennsylvania, and a lot of partnership
[SPEAKER_01]: with Maryland Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be showing you some
results of remote sensing in those three
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for USGS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you see the disclaimer,
it means it hasn't gone through peer
[SPEAKER_01]: review yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chesapeake Bay, Brian just gave us a nice
look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water quality being the primary issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so winter cover crops, although you
know how many benefits they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: really from a Chesapeake Bay program
perspective, it's nutrient and sediment
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So provide cover over the soil surface to
reduce sediment loss and sequester
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen in living biomass to keep it
green over the winter and reduce nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really promoted by a
combination of incentives, particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: Maryland or through NRCS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulation, for example, highly erodible
lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant a cover crop in order to
meet your T factor for your erosion
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention and through extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just good sense farmers talking to each
other, working on soil health and economic
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of winter cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see in a state like Maryland
where there are incentivization for
[SPEAKER_01]: different programs is on-farm performance
is highly variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going from upper left, which is
probably a rye crop planted with dairy
[SPEAKER_01]: manure, getting a nice thick biomass down
to an aerial seeded field that was cost
[SPEAKER_01]: shared by farmers and happened to fail
that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aerial seeding on a high residue situation
with poor rainfall that year got zero
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the environment we're working
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to take a perspective
where combining remote sensing,
[SPEAKER_01]: satellite imagery, airborne imagery of
measuring vegetation on the soil surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: combined with collaboration with ongoing
extension programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowledge of where the fields are in
Maryland, what's going on on them,
[SPEAKER_01]: or other data in other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're thinking with this toolkit,
we can really start quantifying the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental benefits of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our main tools is satellite
imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left, you see a Landsat image of
the entire eastern shore set within that
[SPEAKER_01]: Talbot County, one of our focus areas with
some smaller imagery spot that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained through US Geological Survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really every image is a snapshot in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to collect imagery around
December, January when the crops have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: dormant for the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, come back in April or so
to look at springtime growth before it's
[SPEAKER_01]: terminated in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the soil surface through a
satellite, which sees infrared as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: our visible bands, you can see vegetation
pretty clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bright red here is reflectance in
the near infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the redder fields have higher biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see pine trees here having a high
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a bare field and then various
degrees of vegetation cover within the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a particular farm,
and this is a collaborating farm we work
[SPEAKER_01]: on, then you can start really thinking
about crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think about management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Maryland, we have a lot of center
pivot irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see fields chopped up with crop
rotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through collaboration,
we obtain access to knowledge of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in these fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this farm has enrolled most of its land
in cover crop program.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow a lot of barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any field outlined in yellow is barley
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a particular field, we might know
that it's barley planted at two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: bushels a hectare using a no-till drill
planted on September 14th following corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of information about what's going
on on that field with that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can put a remote sensing
measurement to that and say that
[SPEAKER_01]: management resulted in 670 kilograms per
hectare, pounds per acre of biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do field sampling to back that
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our general strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collaborate with soil conservation
districts, make it up to a lot of farms to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect the field sampling data that Brian
was talking about, and then try to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptive management, giving information
about what's going on on the different
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like saying we have two different
strategies in a state like Pennsylvania or
[SPEAKER_01]: New York where we don't have access to
knowledge of what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use public data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using satellite imagery to look
at ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the cropland data layer to
look at crop type of the previous summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're combining those to look at,
say, what's the ground cover on cornfields
[SPEAKER_01]: in Cayuga County, New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first work, here's an example back in
Talbot of an image that's been shaded with
[SPEAKER_01]: the vegetation index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So brighter colors here is bare fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darker is more vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think about thresholding into different
biomass categories, looking at really
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum, low, medium, high biomass with
corresponding ground cover thresholds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can translate our image of the
landscape into looking at where the bare
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, where the high vegetation fields
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we combine that with the cropland
data layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not familiar with this,
this is a US USDA NAS product,
[SPEAKER_01]: available 28 till present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use imagery analysis to look at
crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here mainly corn and soybean and wheat
fields grown in this county.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by combining those, we can develop,
say, a map of all of the corn fields in
[SPEAKER_01]: Talbot County, including the low biomass,
medium, and high biomass fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are public data sets,
just looking at vegetation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape by crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've developed a tool that will take
the 10 top land uses in a county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll calculate the area of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six and a half percent of the county is
corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at these biomass
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 50% of the corn fields have very little
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%, 28%, a little bit of biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13% medium and 9% high biomass,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhat arbitrary where we set those
cutoff points, but we use calibration data
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to get at some environmental
thresholds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at similar patterns for
soybeans or for other crops in the
[SPEAKER_01]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So by combining these data sets,
we're looking at Talbot County,
[SPEAKER_01]: Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at 2008 through 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the cropland data layer, we can see
that acres of corn land have stayed fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: stable with a little bump in 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just number of fields,
not acres, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number of fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cover crop following corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 55% of corn fields were planted to
cover crops under the subsidy program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see between 2008 and 2013,
that number climbed to 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Maryland cover crop subsidies
increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of corn land in this particular county
in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher than 56 on corn fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 56 over all crop types in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what this bottom graph is all
about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just the number of fields
enrolled in the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the performance data that goes
along with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't looked at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice fine distinction of when a
farmer got enrolled in the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be really interesting to
see if the farmers learned over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not thought about looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can look at is within each of
these corn cover crop fields, what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see in 2009, the brown is
minimal biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dark green is high biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see over this time,
we have shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all corn fields in the county,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as the cover crops have gone up,
we've shifted towards a lot more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one example of an analysis you
can do in a county using this toolkit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this for five counties in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: In collaboration with Stuart Duiker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We published this a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll run through it real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, looking at these counties,
they had a program called Without Carrot
[SPEAKER_01]: or Stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not using incentives, not using
regulations, but really just talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers trying to promote silage crop,
cover crops following corn silage harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very active in the landscape
from 2010 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so along with Stuart Duiker,
and NIFWF funding, we started thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, well, can we see changes in the
landscape as a result of their extension?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the four counties, you can see
the crop type distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just skipping straight to the results,
four years in Berks and York County,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see percentage of bare soil
decrease from 75% to around 50% over that
[SPEAKER_01]: same time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lancaster and Lebanon have a higher
intensity of cover cropping, and bare soil
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease from 50% to 25% within these
counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw some really clear trends over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did say, well, let's make sure this
isn't some bad luck with warmer years over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did look at accumulated growing
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time our images were collected,
fairly stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other analyses also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, between 700, 800, 900 growing
degrees over these time periods,
[SPEAKER_01]: making us come to the conclusion that this
was a real trend, detecting increased
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop implementation in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving you a bird's eye view of
some of the different research we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to look that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three counties in New York just did that
this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in Cayuga County right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an analysis for Cayuga last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in this graphic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at three counties in New York,
looking at satellite imagery, what we find
[SPEAKER_01]: up here is that it's tough to get good
winter imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either cloudy or it's snowing a lot
of the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're looking at landscape imagery,
it comes over every 16 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found best for this analysis
was a springtime analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every April, in most years, we would get a
clear image.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're down here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between the lakes is one of the most
productive grain areas of the southern
[SPEAKER_01]: tier of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see crop type distribution,
a lot of alfalfa, corn, and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the satellite analysis,
for example, of the corn land within the
[SPEAKER_01]: county, a lot of corn land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is a trend analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit different than our last
graph, but the colors are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is corn going from 0% to 100% of corn
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see not a lot of trend over
time in these four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're analyzing going from 73%,
60%, 76%, 80% soil without much
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see 2009-10 had the most cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll say the most vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be cover crop, could be weeds,
could be something else they're rotating
[SPEAKER_01]: into after corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we know is that there's wintertime
vegetation following corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a year with warm temperatures and
a little high biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no real trends over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at Delaware County, downstate near
the Cannonville Reservoir, a lot of just
[SPEAKER_01]: little river bank farms and farms up in
the hillsides, not that much corn land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been extending cover crop or
extending conservation practices for quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing a higher percent
vegetation on these fields with only 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: to 40% non-vegetated fields following corn
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no real trends over time here either.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a nuance, the fields down there are
very small, and I'm a little worried we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting mixed pixels with the edge of the
fields, and they might not actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: that high end option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with Paul Sarasoletti to try to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third County, Cortland County,
a broad distribution of farmland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we had a better series of
imagery here, so more years of analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: with clear imagery in April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see it bouncing around 66%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010, 11, not very good cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014, 15 was a terrible year for cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late corn harvest, wet fall, very few
farmers able to plant cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really are seeing the effect of
climate and farming practices on cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop adoption, not seeing any real trends
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike Pennsylvania, we're finding some
consistent differences between counties
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can think that we can look at
kind of the percent of corn fields or
[SPEAKER_01]: other crop type fields that have winter
vegetation following their harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not really seeing any clear trends
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our initial analysis for New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't written it up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we do in a state where
we're working with public data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Maryland, we're working with private
data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the data for all of the cover crop
enrollment for the entire state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brian was presenting some of the
trends from that data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in particular counties,
we've worked with the agents where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually digitizing the field boundaries
of where the cover crop fields are,
[SPEAKER_01]: which allow us to analyze the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're moving toward doing that for
the entire state as part of the grant work
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've done with Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working through an annual remote
sensing analysis for the entire state.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we're really focusing on
Talbot County, you recall I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about field boundaries planted to
particular crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This farmer released this information,
which is why I can show it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't show it for the rest of the
county what was going on, except in
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregate form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the number of fields
planted to cover crops over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, increasing over time in Talbot
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to really look at every
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I already presented this type of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we can get into is really
what are the agronomic factors and the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidy program that are leading towards
variable success in cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what they are, really,
from your own knowledge of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's planting method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's previous crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nitrogen, soils, weather,
planting date.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these factors add up to determine
health of the cover crop, performance of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's looking at planting date,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Brian showed some interesting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the number of fields planted
within the early, late, mid planting
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early is this green line, and that's
planted before October 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take home message, the only way you're
going to get more than 15 kilograms of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen in a cover crop is by planting it
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a big peak of late planted
fields that really don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial nitrogen sequestration
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my point of view, let's give
feedback to the farmer to push the
[SPEAKER_01]: planting date earlier so that we get more
environmental benefit from our subsidies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This graph is the accumulated biomass on
this access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about a ton per acre,
1,000 kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gray is growing degrees before
December 31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you plant September 1st,
you get 100 growing, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the number, but you get this
many growing degrees, and the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees dwindle over time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plant November 3rd, very low
growing degree accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green line is the average biomass for
every crop in Talbot County planted on
[SPEAKER_01]: that date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you see a very tight relationship
between planting date, growing degree,
[SPEAKER_01]: and biomass on January 3rd, January 6th is
when this image analysis occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you see a little bump here in
mid-October that's, we think, associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with folks who are planting wheat for
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a swift method there to a lot
more drilled cover crops at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the type of analysis you can
get to when you start looking at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop fields in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also break it up by other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the differences in species,
number of fields enrolled, biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: and nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just for one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at this over six years,
you start throwing weatherers into the
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more complicated, and I'm
looking forward to Brian's methods to help
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of tease out these related factors in
our enrollment data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see difference in nitrogen content
related to planting date, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: relating to planting method with,
you know, science is proving the obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know that if you drill and get
good seed soil contact, you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: better biomass and nitrogen accumulation
than if you're broadcasting by and large.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at this as a census of
all the fields in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes a fairly powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can translate this again into
dollars per pound of nitrogen sequestered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that early planted rye is
a pretty good deal for the taxpayers
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to late planted wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about that nitrogen being
recycled back to the field for the farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: better deal for the farmer as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can balance that out with
incentive payments and come out to an
[SPEAKER_01]: average payment per kilogram nitrogen that
Brian's showing to be fairly consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good point, Brian, it's a good
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we put together these slides,
which are a couple of years old actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've developed a calibration data set for
looking at percent ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the correlation between the remote
sensing data and percent ground cover is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a lot tighter than for biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biomass, you can measure it until it
covers the ground and then saturates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't tell the difference between
500 kilograms of biomass and 3000
[SPEAKER_01]: kilograms of biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell it up to about a thousand,
up to about a ton per acre, you can tell
[SPEAKER_01]: differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can measure well through the critical
environmental threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can just say, there's a lot of
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's similar with percent ground
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 0% and 80% ground cover,
we can distinguish pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, we can just say,
so it's covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be focusing on that with more
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to find all kind of conclusions of
what we see in the landscape, the very
[SPEAKER_01]: high biomass fields tend to be rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a great thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's excellent to have a cover crop on a
heavily minored field with a long history
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrient application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a great environmental success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've sampled some fields where there's
still 100, 200 pounds of residual nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great that cover crop gets half
of that, but half of it still has to
[SPEAKER_01]: leach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a time for nutrient management
plants to come in, in combination with
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops to really solve these
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is greener always better?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's a happy medium
from a nitrogen leaching point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see a lot of nutrient limited
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops doing poorly, not because of a
late planting or aerial seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be early planted, drilled rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do poorly because there's no
residual nitrogen field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cover crop purists might say,
well, fertilize it and you get more
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've yet to convince Maryland of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a lower threshold for cover crop
success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to achieve a certain amount of
biomass by a certain amount of time to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good environmental benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that nitrogen limitation becomes a
kind of a sticking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cannot remote sense the amount of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we define success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Successful strategies, I think,
fit with the climate and the farming
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at a diverse farming
system with good niches for healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: productive cover crops, that's how we
define success in terms of simple
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking about maybe some
critical thresholds for percent of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experimentation, innovation, adoption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then getting back to carrot or stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a combination of incentive,
regulation, and just plain old farm to
[SPEAKER_01]: farm transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing the practice of healthy cover
crops is what's going to get us to the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental endpoints of a lot of
healthy cover crops in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remote sensing is one tool in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a broad brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look at a field and say there's
green on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's chickweed or if it's
rye or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through collaboration with the farmers,
you know more and more what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a good tool here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody's interested in looking at
your county or looking at particular
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, looking at spatial variation in
fields, thinking about year to year
[SPEAKER_01]: variability, looking forward to working
with the sustainable ag lab folks as they
[SPEAKER_01]: get their cover crop growth models going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think combining the cover crop growth
models with the remote sensing will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good further development.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a few years, we were going out
October, December, April in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sampling nitrogen in the top foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a fair amount of residual
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see about half of it collected by the
cover crop and the other half lost below
[SPEAKER_01]: the top foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really by springtime, you've lost a
lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've lost all your nitrogen from your
top foot in our environment, sandy soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly high rainfall in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose the nitrogen out of the surface
soil in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also seen evidence of the cover
crops going down and catching that pulse
[SPEAKER_01]: from deeper soil and bringing it up,
where the amount of nitrogen in a cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop in the springtime was more than the
amount of nitrogen in the top foot of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where it comes from came from that
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing into the spring is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the March 1st cutoff date was
historic from early organization of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop program to fit all of the
farmers' needs without scaring anyone off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're basically saying, well,
after March 1st, you can do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's up to the extension folks to
say, hey, farmers, there's a real soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health benefit from going longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you don't need Maryland to pay you
the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you just need to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are farmers who talk about rye
getting away from them in the spring and
[SPEAKER_01]: not knowing how to kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys who are really good at
springtime management, I think there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole talk about spring management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's something that's
developed in the last five years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more knowledge, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to bring that type of
information to Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're looking at the springtime,
let's look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remote sensing gets tricky in the spring
because certain fields get terminated,
[SPEAKER_01]: other fields grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really have to, you can't look
at the whole landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start looking at termination
dates and follow fields as they go from
[SPEAKER_01]: green to yellow to brown to planted to
green again with the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of mineralization
happens in the springtime and you should
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good cover up there to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not resisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they'd be open to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at USGS, we like calling them unmanned
aerial vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've used them a little bit
experimentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based out of Belt to Lag Research
Station and we're within the DC no-fly
[SPEAKER_01]: boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some work on the offshore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, for me, I'm looking at the
watershed landscape approach on sticking
[SPEAKER_01]: to satellites and the satellites increase
in accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then yes, the red edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very useful for measuring nitrogen
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were doing most of this work up to
2013, we were using spot imagery,
[SPEAKER_01]: which only has red, green, blue,
near and for red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not able to measure nitrogen
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can use worldview three.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at crop residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not talking about it, but we have a
whole project that's looking at crop
[SPEAKER_01]: residue and tillage intensity remote
sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, you can start measuring
the nitrogen percent nitrogen content of
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with proximal sensors,
things that you're flying over the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's where we go with the next
five years of brain work or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the biomass saturation,
I think that's always going to saturate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to measure the nitrogen
content along with the biomass is
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the farmers, what they want to know is
how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that nitrogen content of small
things varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When percent and a half and five percent
depending on stage growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the rest of the conference,
please get in touch with me and give me
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your knowledge to add into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
