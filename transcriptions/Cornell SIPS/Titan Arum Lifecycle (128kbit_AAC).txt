[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, this is a morphophallus titanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the titan arum, or the corpse
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets the name titan arum from Sir
Attenborough on a BBC special,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he thought it was inappropriate to
talk about a morphophallus in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: family and children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he dubbed it the titan arum.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're looking at is the largest
unbranched inflorescence in the botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by inflorescence, we mean a stem that
bears more than one flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a structure that's
called the spath in the spadix.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the spath, which is a highly
modified leaf that wraps around the
[SPEAKER_01]: spadix, which will eventually be revealed
when this is ready to be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spadix is a central stem that bears
numerous little flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this particular case, the flowers
that are going to produce seeds are at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom, and the flowers that produce
pollen are up towards the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this flower is ready to be
pollinated, this spath will unfurl,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking like a dress of a ballerina,
except upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the inside, it'll be brilliantly red to
maroon to mimic the appearance of rotting
[SPEAKER_01]: flesh, because in addition to producing
that appearance of rotting flesh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it also releases a very foul smell that
attracts flies, and also, many believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: carrion-eating beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that red inner surface of the spath is
supposed to mimic a carcass, of some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of animal, and the fragrance is supposed
to mimic rotting flesh to attract flies
[SPEAKER_01]: and carrion beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my nose, this particular species,
the fragrance, if we want to dignify it
[SPEAKER_01]: with that word, smells like rotting fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: A related plant, the kojak, a
morphophallus kojak, which is figured over
[SPEAKER_01]: there, is reported to smell like rotting
mouse or rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of the species actually has its
own fragrance, and there's two,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, that are very pleasant in their
fragrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One smells like chopped carrot,
and the other smells a little bit like
[SPEAKER_01]: banana, but we are in front of the corpse
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the reproductive aspect of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is hidden is the underground working
part from year to year, and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: corm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what the underground part of
the plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, this is called a corm,
which is a highly modified stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inflorescence, the collection of
flowers with the spath in spadix,
[SPEAKER_01]: emerges from the center of the corm,
and in fact, if you look in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a very good indication that this
corm may be ready to produce its own
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the flowers open up and are
pollinated and produce seed, the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: inflorescence withers and breaks apart
after the fruits and seeds are dispersed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this corm will send up the vegetative
parts of the plant, the plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are one or more leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the babies of We Stinky that
we collected two to three years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and thanks to the wonderful staff here,
like Paul Cooper, who have kept these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants happy and growing well,
we now have additional specimens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is what a leaf of the titan arum
will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the base of a single leaf that is
then divided into three, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely decorative and extremely
beautiful plants, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what will happen is eventually
these leaves will exhaust themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll become dormant, and the corm will
rest for a while, for an unprescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: number of months, and then the cycle will
be repeated over and over again with some
[SPEAKER_01]: luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's people like Paul Cooper who
have done such a brilliant job keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants happy that the same specimen
is actually flowering in less than three
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unusual to have a corm produce
an inflorescence over such a short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there's a resting period of maybe
five, six, and in some cases, as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after pollination, the spate,
that outer skirt modified leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: will wither, and the pollen-producing
flowers, which are up towards the top,
[SPEAKER_01]: will also wither, but then what will
happen is the individual flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the female plants, each of them will
develop an individual fruit, and each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these now is the fruit of a single flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bright red is believed to attract
birds, like hornbills, which are common in
[SPEAKER_01]: Indonesia's Sumatra, and the birds will,
it's believed, disperse these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll eat the outer fleshy part of the
fruit, and the inner part of the fruit is
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nut, and inside that nut is the
actual seed, and that passes through the
[SPEAKER_01]: birds, and that's the way these plants get
dispersed.
[SPEAKER_01]: in their native environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
