[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about some of
the different types of projects that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been involved in in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to seem possibly like a
schizophrenic talk, and if so,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's because my job is a little bit
schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in two research units, both the
Plant Genetic Resources Unit, and those of
[SPEAKER_00]: you who are lucky enough to hear Joanne
last week speak, she's in this unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also work with the Grape Genetics
Research Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is involved in conservation of
crops, and it's a seed bank sort of group,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this one is more involved in
understanding grape genomics and genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just start by talking about what
is a computational biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of terms you hear,
bioinformatics, computational biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I like the term computational
biologist because it explains the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that I am first a biologist, but I do it
by computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my original training was in genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about the structure, function,
and evolution of genomes, but I do it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer instead of at a lab bench or in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the perspective that I come to
this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started as a biologist and then added
the computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is why what I do is going to sound
a little bit complicated, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of my time is paid for by the folks
who work in the clonal repository,
[SPEAKER_00]: and clonal just means that these crops are
grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the apples, the tart cherries,
and the grapes that we curate in Geneva
[SPEAKER_00]: and we distribute the germplasm and
characterize it, and I'm part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24% of my time is working with the seed
repository, and there are many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many vegetables in this repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joanne is in this group, and one of them
is tomato, and you'll see some work that
[SPEAKER_00]: we did in tomato there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15% of my time is on apple root stock
breeding with Genaro Fazio, who's in this
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the remaining 20% of my time is
split between working on grape scion
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics and grape disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work on a vast variety of types of
questions and a vast variety of organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what you're going to see today is
going to cover a lot of organisms and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just bear with me, strap your seatbelt
in, because it's going to be fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I'm going to try and do is at
least get across what it is we want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we wanted to find out,
why we wanted to find it out, and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of projects,
so just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first series of projects I'm going
to talk about actually came out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with people in this very
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courtney and Surin approached me many
years ago and asked me, what can we do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the resistance gene analogs in Rubus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized there's an opportunity here
to work out a system that could be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other crops that we have in our
repository, and so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, what came out of that was
also, eventually later, a master's thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: from a student at RIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I've done in Geneva
is help supervise or act as a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: thesis advisor for master's students
working in the field of bioengineering and
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics at Rochester Institute of
Technology, who need real-life problems to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on and somebody to help guide them
through, that they can apply what they've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned toward and then make it into a
thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two theses I'll talk about
today, and one of them was done with
[SPEAKER_00]: Aubrey Bailey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of neat to see the
progression, and this project actually
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of something that was a
collaboration originally from this
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this project, we collected a whole
bunch of resistance gene analogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's convenient about these NBS LRR
resistance genes is that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved sections that can be used for
sitting primers down, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: amplify between them to get the variable
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because that's a convenient thing to
do, lots of people have done this in other
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms besides the ones that we
gathered the sequences from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gathered a whole bunch from
GeneBank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected some from Cherry from our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected a whole bunch from apples in
our collection, and there are even the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that we got from the project with
Courtney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these, what Aubrey, the student
from RIT, was able to do was to cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: these, and we were able to see,
classify these resistance genes according
[SPEAKER_00]: to what their sequence similarity was
based on a hypothetically translated
[SPEAKER_00]: protein sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a huge, huge, huge project,
and we were also involving all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes found in the then
recently sequenced apple genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a big tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that they were classified,
that there were some resistance genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: were not even found in domestic apple at
all, but they were available in other wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and that's important because if
you're trying to find parents to breed for
[SPEAKER_00]: novel resistance in apple, you might want
to go for the samples in our germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: collection that have novel resistance gene
analogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can in turn help breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, we've also, with a big
group that involved collaborators from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world, we've mapped some of these
resistance gene analogs to fire blight
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, we're just finishing it up,
there's one that might actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: it came from a powdery mildew resistant
cherry strain, and Amy Iazzoni in Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: State is mapping QTL there, and so it may
be that we will also have a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: result, that these things are showing up
in the same part of the genome that is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in known resistance for cherries
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're switching gears now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another type of project I've
done, and this one had to do with figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: out what the risk was of transferring,
transmitting resistant alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry, disease susceptible alleles
depending on which grape root stock you
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a question with this freedom
grape root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's valuable because it's nematode
resistant, but the question about freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: is, does it already have, is it likely to
already have phylloxera resistance or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's likely to be phylloxera
susceptible, then it might not be so good
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding more grape root stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question in this case was more of a
paternity analysis question, because if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could piece together who the parents and
grandparents were of freedom, and if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were not vinifera, then freedom was more
likely to be resistant to phylloxera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that freedom was derived from open
pollinated parents, and there were 31
[SPEAKER_00]: potential pollen donors in a grape,
in a vineyard in Fresno that David
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramming, one USDA grape breeder,
had, but we didn't know which parents
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the actual pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took 30 microsatellite markers,
and this is old technology, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took 30 microsatellite markers and
we looked at this genetic tree of freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: and also of its half-sib harmony,
and we started asking, who are the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that, and also some of these
individuals were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones in the boxes are definitely
dead, and we knew that the mother of
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom was 161359.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to confirm that because that
sample was still alive in the vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: when we tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that the grandmother was supposed
to be 1613C.
[SPEAKER_00]: We confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we identified that the
grandfather of freedom was derived from a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross between riperia and rupestris,
neither of which is vinifera, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice because that means that it's
less likely to be susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: phylloxera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tried to find these individuals,
but it appears that they were no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: alive in the vineyard, or else their
alleles weren't unique enough to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify with this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a paternity analysis in grape
that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, switching gears again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another master's thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's on a completely different
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about fungi now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lance Cadel Davidson is a collaborator of
mine in Geneva, and he works on disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in grapes and on their
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a project where he had a lot of
sequence from a great many different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of grape powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem, and he got his thesis
this year, or just this past year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was again another RIT student that
I had supervised for his thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with grape powdery mildew,
which is here, is that there was almost no
[SPEAKER_00]: information about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were maybe five sequences in GenBank
altogether or something on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its next closest relative that we knew
anything about was way down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Blumeria graminis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one was sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a paper where lots of people
got together and annotated it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was nothing available for this
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was we went to
transcriptomics, so we took the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts, and we had to figure out how
to assemble a reference transcriptome from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch, and then how to describe the
polymorphisms among the different
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had 56 of them if you include the
reference version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was an example of taking organism
that you know almost nothing about from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch and figuring out what you can just
from the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together, Jason and I worked out a
workflow, and this was a lot of trial and
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of 454 sequencing of the
region of one single isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a lot of Illumina paired
in sequencing data from that isolate plus
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 other geographic isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's different about these isolates
is that some, there's a genetics arms race
[SPEAKER_00]: going on between the powdery mildew and
the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is what regions of the
powdery mildew genome are mutating more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we can figure out which ones
are mutating more quickly, we might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: clue as to which parts are helping the
powdery mildew gain access foothold into
[SPEAKER_00]: the vineyards where there's supposed to be
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, how it's winning its
side of the arms race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the whole object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to do that, first we had to
figure out how to assemble the genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry, the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mapped to the closest relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also did paired in sequencing,
assembled that, and assembled that de
[SPEAKER_00]: novo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of these three different assemblies,
we devised ways of ascertaining which
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly was the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's tricky all in itself because is
it by length of contigs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it by number of contigs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it maybe by how many protein
sequences are predicted that make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what you expect in, say,
the next closest relative?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to balance a lot of different
criteria in order to figure out which is
[SPEAKER_00]: your best assembly to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once we did do that, then we did some
finer tuning of figuring out which genes
[SPEAKER_00]: we had relatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took the single end sequence,
or the other isolates, and aligned them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this all together and ended up putting
it in a genome browser so our scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues at the bench in other parts of
the country and the world could then go
[SPEAKER_00]: and identify these regions and start to
focus their research on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of some of the types
of ways that we would visualize the data
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to figure out if what we had even
made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here on the left is simply a scatter
plot of contig length versus number of
[SPEAKER_00]: reads in the contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that you would want to have
bigger contigs ought to be bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: not because you have the same read piling
up on top of itself over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over, but rather you have multiple reads
all sticking next to each other building a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger and larger and larger contig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of comforting to see that we
do have a relationship there where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have more contigs or more reads in the
larger contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the assembly is probably
working fairly well and that the libraries
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't just copies all of the same
transcript over and over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of each other, because even when
you normalize that doesn't always
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was good confirmation that the
assembly seemed to be working and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: normalization had worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to ask, well if the
contigs, as they get longer and longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they ought to match things that you
expect to see in that organism better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do say a blast match
between two different sequences,
[SPEAKER_00]: the score that you get is dependent on the
length of that match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer that section of sequence is
that matches, the better your score is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a contig that's longer,
it ought to have better potential to match
[SPEAKER_00]: a long contig somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it ought to have a better
blast score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is a graph with the length of
the contigs along the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer contigs are over here and
the shorter contigs are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the blast score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that while we do get some
longer contigs with pretty low blast
[SPEAKER_00]: matches, the better blast matches do come
from the longest contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that these are probably
matching what they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did the assembly assemble
things end to end to end the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: should have, but the things it assembled
actually are matching stuff that we expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all the sort of work that you
have to go through when you've got a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new organism nobody knows anything about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason did a lot of work for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just take a look at how much did
we see versus what we expected to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the ways that we did our
annotation, the way we labeled what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the powdery mildew genome,
was we did reciprocal blasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we searched the powdery mildew genome
with the Blumeria graminis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcripts or protein sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we searched the Blumeria graminis
sequences with the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever there was a reciprocal
one-to-one match,
[SPEAKER_00]: so protein A liked protein, Blumeria
protein A liked powdery mildew protein B
[SPEAKER_00]: better than any other powdery mildew
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And powdery mildew protein B liked
Blumeria protein A better than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: Blumeria protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call a reciprocal
one-to-one best match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just one quick and dirty way to
figure out whether those two things are
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely to be the analogs of each
other in each genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we did this, we found 4,000 or
4,500 reciprocal best matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Blumeria genome altogether,
we had only 6,000 queries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means if powdery mildew has about
the same genome size and about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: number of proteins in its transcriptome as
Blumeria, then we found over two-thirds of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not the closest relative in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you saw that tree,
there's a lot of things in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fungi mutate quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for the next closest relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how we labeled the genes or
the proteins that we found in powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also characterized these proteins
among all the different 56 isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took what we had over-sequenced,
our reference isolate, and then compared
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other 55 isolates to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these, like this one and this
one and this one, had, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not, these numbers of SNPs and
indels are not because of biological fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because these are actually pooled
samples themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these samples here actually represent
multiple isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was an artifact of how the
laboratory work was done at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: before we figured out how to properly
barcode samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other ones did have numerous SNPs
and indels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breakdown was sort of interesting
about, of all the predicted protein
[SPEAKER_00]: differences, about 21% were
non-synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 21% or 18% of the total were
non-synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 3% actually looked like stop codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are all obviously based on
low-quality aluminotide, high-throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always the possibility of
sequencing error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, the fact that we're
conceptually translating these to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with, as well as comparing them to their
nearest relative protein sequence in
[SPEAKER_00]: another organism that who knows how close
it really, really is, but it's our best
[SPEAKER_00]: chance, so that's all we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But altogether, what we can say is that
the regions where we found, so 18 or 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: of those polymorphisms do look like they
might be involved in this arms race
[SPEAKER_00]: between the pathogen and the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are now the ones that,
here's the genome browser, and here are
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the various positions
where there are mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are now the regions of the
genome that our bench colleagues can focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on to find possible genes related in what
powdery mildew uses to overcome the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance of the host to its infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now we're gonna move back into
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was one of the people early on a few
years ago who started looking at how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do, along with Paola here, but in a
different set of grape species,
[SPEAKER_00]: or grape populations, how to use
genotyping by sequencing data to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information about genes responsible for
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the projects I did was I
compared the TASL pipeline, which is pure
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-wide association mapping,
and traditional QTL mapping just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the population I used in this case,
it was two populations actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y1 by Y3, so the blue versus the red,
and then Y1 versus Y4, so the blue versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for various traits that had to do
with table grape quality, so in other
[SPEAKER_00]: words, less seeds or no seeds,
berry size, that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is all what you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a big berry with no seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least that's what the public wants,
so that's what David Ramming wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's breeding table grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our populations had 71 offspring
between these two individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 17 offspring between these two
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We genotyped these two individuals three
times each, and this individual twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes important later when you
try to do QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need, in order to create a genetic
map, you really do, if you're doing GBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really do need to get deeper coverage
of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just talk real briefly about
genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably most of you here have seen this a
million times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have even displayed this slide
before yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you do it at PAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I borrowed this slide from the
workshops that the Institute of Genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity provides, and that's because
it's a good slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, genotyping by sequencing is a
way of getting polymorphism out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: genome with just using restriction enzyme
fragments and high-throughput technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into a whole lot more
detail about it right now, but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need to know is we do genome
complexity reduction by choosing the
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, the way we pick where
the genotyping is going to occur is by
[SPEAKER_00]: what the restriction enzyme site is going
to be that cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use that information to figure
out where the polymorphisms are and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out the polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing marker discovery and
genotyping simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of this over chips,
if you haven't heard this already,
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you have a SNP chip, you have to
already know what the diversity you expect
[SPEAKER_00]: or what the polymorphisms you expect to
see are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you won't see them because
you're not assaying for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, if it's there in a restriction
site and you cover the genome deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can either have a loss of a
site, which is a lot harder to see because
[SPEAKER_00]: these data are very patchy, or what you
can have is a difference in sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: between two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's much, much easier to ascertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a side note, I tried to do a
project for somebody once where sample two
[SPEAKER_00]: was gamma irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are supposed to be deletions in
the other genome, and it completely failed
[SPEAKER_00]: with GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking of trying to find
deletions by GBS, talk to me first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave it a really hard, good,
solid try, and I wasn't able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not actually consider it very
good at finding deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is good at finding polymorphisms
when the site is found between multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It scales well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no ascertainment bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lab-wise, it's nice because you
don't have to size fractionate the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to do with rad tags,
which is another way of doing this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: data gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pick your restriction enzyme
based on how frequently it cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and whether or not it's methylation
sensitive, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to avoid certain parts
of the genome that might be methylated,
[SPEAKER_00]: say you want to go for the euchromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably dating myself using that
term, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go for the parts of the
genome that have the genes in them versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-coding part of the genome,
you might want to go for methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive enzymes or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's nice about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can pick how often you get a
marker and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to these two grape
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called and mapped genotypes, there are 19
chromosomes in grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the QTL analysis, there were many
fewer markers called for each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we obviously were able to map them
because we were using join map to map
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: With TASL, which was a GWAS method,
we used all of the tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this version, we used just the
biggest mapping population, the 71
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the GWAS, we were able to throw all
the data in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic mapping wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just tried to assume where the markers
fell based on the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome sequence that's been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's also problematic because we
know that some of these markers that when
[SPEAKER_00]: we did our mapping with join map,
that those markers did not show up where
[SPEAKER_00]: the grape genome assembly said they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you use this type of method,
you have to watch out for that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line was that no matter
which method you used, it often found the
[SPEAKER_00]: same region of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seedlessness, known seedlessness,
QTL on linkage group 18 was found both
[SPEAKER_00]: with TASL, which are the green dots,
and with map QTL, which are the blue dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have enough data and the system
is robust enough, you will find your
[SPEAKER_00]: associations either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize the difference
between these two methods, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional mapping, you'll get about 10
times less markers because you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: confident in how they are phased between
the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a high read depth for the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember I said we genotyped Y1 and Y3
each three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we had not done that, we would have
had problems doing traditional mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was another project that was
trying to do the same thing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different population in grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paula remembers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was tricky because those parents
had only been genotyped once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried running that data set through
my pipeline, and I was not able to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic map because I didn't have enough
information for what the markers should be
[SPEAKER_00]: according to what the parents were because
the parents weren't sequenced deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the traditional mapping approach,
you can create the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have an existing map or
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With GWAS, you get a lot more markers,
and it's a brute force method more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses just the sheer number of markers
to work, and it allows imputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method, we did not do imputing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this method, you can genotype parents
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be good if you had,
say, a big open pollinated population out
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature, and you were just trying to
find out how the traits were associated in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you had a population that you
inherited from another breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you weren't really sure how the
individuals were related because you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't find their notebooks or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a valuable enough population to
spend time on because it had the trait you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GWAS would probably be better for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it turns out that the VitisGen
project is actually working on a way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping, genetic mapping, from these data
without having to go through some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to see how their
unique pipeline will work in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: projects I'm going to be, that I'm working
on at the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned, and I'll let you know how
that works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to switch gears again,
but this time only to a different grape
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to show you, this is one
of those slides that I had to make
[SPEAKER_00]: purposely vague because I know this is
going to end up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have mapped a grape trait, a
developmental trait, to one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes with really strong QTL
evidence using this same technology where
[SPEAKER_00]: we take the GBS data, we filter it down,
and then we do traditional genetic mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: and QTL mapping with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this population is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got 142 offspring, which is huge for
a clonal crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with a little over 2,000
markers on a paternal map because the
[SPEAKER_00]: trait is segregating between, in the
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a decent number of markers in
each of the linkage groups, about 100 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a trait, and hopefully by
this time next year I'll be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what it is, openly because we'll have
published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, finally, one other thing I thought
would be fun to tell you about is
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes when I'm doing the type of work
I'm doing, there aren't tools to do what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of my job sometimes,
not sometimes, but so often most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, because most of the time there are
other research labs out in the world doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what, the same kind of thing, and I can
take their tool and use it for our
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes there isn't a tool like
that, or I don't know about one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I think of one, and then I make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought I'd mention this one to
you guys just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this tool, it came out an idea I got
from attending Carl Sievert's course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody here who hasn't attended or
thought about attending Carl Sievert's
[SPEAKER_00]: chemometrics course ought to think about
it, especially if you ever spend time in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, because it's not just about wine
and beer characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about how to do multi-dimensional
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not trained in statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a geneticist, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trained in molecular genetics,
and I had to teach classical genetics when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a grad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: But statistics is not something I'm that
strong in, and so I really enjoyed taking
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl Sievert's course in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the methods that he taught us
about was how to do principal components
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started thinking about this,
and I thought, you know, genetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have two homozygotes and a
heterozygote between them, from a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, the heterozygote is actually
genetically intermediate, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the traits are co-dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not code those genotypes as ones
and zeros and twos and treat it like PCA
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if you get correlations between
the genotype and a trait or a behavior or
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of characteristic that you're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried it, and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really cool about it is that
it's a way to assess genetic correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between the markers and the
characteristics because you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: principal components loading plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually say, okay,
which principal coordinate actually
[SPEAKER_00]: separates my sample according to,
say, fruit size or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one of them does and the bigger
fruits are over here and the littler
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits are over here according to that one
principal coordinate, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually take the data and go back and ask
which markers contributed to that
[SPEAKER_00]: principal component, which ones are
actually giving, which genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which alleles are giving you that access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells you what part of the genome
might be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a cool thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's nice about it,
and the examples I'll show you here are
[SPEAKER_00]: from this application, and that is it's a
direct way to visualize genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships among organisms because you
can just plot them according to their
[SPEAKER_00]: principal components genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spacing you see is the genetic
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the actual, like, amalgam of or an
addition of all the different genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not multi-dimensional scaling
where it's just taking all the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, like, figure out a way to
stretch it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, these are the actual physical points
in space, triangulate, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulated points in space that you get
when you look at genetic, the sum of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic differences among these organisms
according to these different components
[SPEAKER_00]: that separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the example in the paper is tomato
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I promised tomato data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is in our collection in Geneva
that Larry Robertson curates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have samples of tomato, which obviously
contain the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's where I'm a geneticist because
I'm like, we have samples of tomato DNA in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual tomato plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, can we genetically
tell which samples are closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of domestication?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see if I still have this slide
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain what happened here with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who saw Joanne's talk last
week saw a really nice cartoon of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, tomatoes were domesticated
in three general area parts or three place
[SPEAKER_00]: that overlaps with Chile, Ecuador,
and Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little spot in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the wild tomato diversity
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where people came and said,
oh, we could eat these tiny little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started eating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, in the deep dark history of
tomato, they started becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, the better ones started
spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have samples from Chile,
Ecuador, and Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have samples from the countries
contiguous to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened was the
conquistadors came from Europe to South
[SPEAKER_00]: America and said, oh, what are these
things you people are eating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us take them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took them to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a bottleneck in the diversity
of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only a subset of the tomatoes got to go
and visit Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when people from Europe started
colonizing North America, they brought
[SPEAKER_00]: some tomatoes from Europe up to North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been two major bottlenecks
in the history of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that we saw tomato that
led to the germplasm that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now subsequently, there's been other
things like introgressions from other wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species back in that started in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before 1940, if you saw a tomato,
it was usually most diverse if it was from
[SPEAKER_00]: where tomatoes were domesticated,
a little less allelic diversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample in Europe, and then even less in
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the conventional wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was, could we see this in
the tomatoes in our collections?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at 50 different accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 were from Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six were from countries next to Chile,
Ecuador, and Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30 were from places other than that,
like other continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, first of all,
it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first principle component explained 20
percent of the variation in the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the genetic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second principle component explained
10 percent more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third explained 6 percent more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only probably, I mean, you don't really
need to look deeper than three unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to say compare fruit size or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe one of the components later than
that might explain the specific kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking at just the
diversity among the samples, and not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for certain traits, traits,
diversity in a certain trait, then this is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably good enough just to stop at the
first three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, the biggest cloud are
these yellow dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These represent the 14 samples from the
primary center of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red dots are a little bit less
inside of that cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a subset of that cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that made it to places
like Argentina, where they're contiguous
[SPEAKER_00]: to Chile, say, but not in the center of
diversity or where they were domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, when you look at the last
few, which is the last 30, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: see in this picture, but actually that is,
you can actually rotate these plots if you
[SPEAKER_00]: use R, which is a really nice staff
package that's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the blue dots are
actually inside of the yellow dots and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually smaller than this big red disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually see that the tomatoes
that come from the places furthest from
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were originally domesticated
have the least allelic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method also works in grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a big study where we looked at 120
accessions of grapes, both in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection and some from China that were
brought by our collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked, how do these things look if
you sequence 30 different genes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: throw their sequences into this PCA thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here are the first three principal
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the North American grapes are in this
pale blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European grapes are in this sort of
orange color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Asian grapes are in the blue
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few that are known hybrids
that are other colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what's really interesting to
see is that some of the North American
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes that come from the part of North
America near Asia are a little more like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Asian grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also able to show with this,
we were able to see in some cases where
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were labeled as North American
were probably hybrids with venephra,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun sometimes to develop your own
tools to answer questions about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project is being written up by
Heidi Schwann and a team of us in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's been written up and we're
in the cycles of submitting and
[SPEAKER_00]: resubmitting at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a fun thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like I'm going to leave enough
time for students to ask questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some other projects in the works,
just big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just started surveying apple
germplasm for SRNA cellules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is coming out of a project that
was spearheaded by Ganyuan Zhang and Sean
[SPEAKER_00]: Miles that you may remember from working
with Ed Buckler on grape SNP diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're doing is, or what we have
all as a group done, and this also
[SPEAKER_00]: involves collaborators in Fort Collins,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken 42 species and 1,600
accessions from our collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some other domestica,
proprietary domestica varieties that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have our in collection, and done a
huge GBS survey of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two enzymes were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I mentioned that in GBS you can
use different enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also combine enzymes to get
different coverage of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of that variety, data, what Sean and
his team are doing, are looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity among the apple germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because these data involve small
snippets of sequence, it's also possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to hunt in them for genes of interest,
known genes of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing that I'm doing with
Gennaro Frazio is hunting for markers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the region of the SRNA cellules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I should explain what the SRNA
cellules are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple is self-incompatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to make an apple that
breeds true, the only way to do that is to
[SPEAKER_00]: graft it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it is a clonal crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now many of you may already know
this, but in case you didn't, now you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to breed one apple to another,
it has to have a different SRNA cellule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why for example, when you grow
an apple orchard, you need to have other
[SPEAKER_00]: than something, say you have a big bunch
of golden delicious trees, and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: golden delicious apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if you don't include at least one
crab apple or some other non-golden
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious pollinator, you will not get
apples at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so also suppose you want to make
apple germplasm or breed apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just want to grow them,
you want to breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you need to know what the resistance
alleles are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're hoping is that once we
survey our collection for all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different possible alleles, that we may be
able to suggest good alternative breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: parents for creating new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see some of the people who work on
apple breeding nodding, so I'm on track
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm glad they agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's one project that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also hunt, because I still have
those friends, remember way back when I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about the RGAs and the fire blight
resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well those colleagues down there in West
Virginia are also interested in disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we've figured out how to survey
these GBS markers for SRNAs alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll branch off into other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one might be fire blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be, say, dwarfing traits or
other interesting traits that we want in
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hunt for them, because it's a
nice big database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll be able to suggest parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project that's started is Lance
Cale Davidson has a person that he's hired
[SPEAKER_00]: into his lab who wants a master's degree
in bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's actually, now in this case,
instead of RIT giving us a student,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually giving RIT a student,
but it's still going to work in a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's enrolling in RIT in bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lance and I will work together with
our colleagues at RIT to mentor her
[SPEAKER_00]: through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's working on the pathogen botrytis
centuria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some fun other research
projects going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just briefly, because I know that in
the guidelines for what we are supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about for these adjunct appointments,
I just thought I'd mention that I also do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I travel to career fairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've given guest lectures in high
schools, like in Trumanburg High School.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who teaches biology,
AP Biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've given crop domestication
lectures there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help with making DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: With kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of fun outreach
things that we get to do with this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: job, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to Empire Farm Days, talk to the
public about the kinds of work that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in Geneva, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are way, way, way too many
individual collaborators to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, what I'll do is I'll just
quickly mention the labs that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Geneva, in the USDA, that's every other
scientist in the unit, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, sadly, are no longer in the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've enjoyed working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are USDA scientists elsewhere that I
have worked with and still work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are Cornell scientists I've
published with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have any kind of idea for a
project that would relate to our germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: or our grape cyan or disease resistance
work, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a student that you want
help guiding, because they have some
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatic component let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also scientists elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Amy Izzoni, Michael Malinoi,
David Francis, Sue Gardner, Andrews Pyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Sulton, Yingxin Wan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there were two RIT students
that did master's theses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in as summer students,
liked working with us so much that they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to stay and make their project
based on their thesis project based on
[SPEAKER_00]: what we worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was whether this data set
looked like it matched the gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is that except for these,
none of these are developed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are vitus vinifera and they're wild
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of these are all basically
wild accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so nobody really knows how grapes
evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that there looks like there
was one big giant explosion of grapes all
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the problem with
visualizing these data with a phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: tree is because what you get is a big
brush of everything all splitting off
[SPEAKER_00]: almost at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's tricky is that
almost all of these freely interbreed with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you move one somewhere else,
they just start happily interbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one grape in North America
that doesn't do that because it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different number of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even it can be made to cross breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people think it doesn't even
belong in vitus necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they think it's like an out group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does match what we might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really hard to know what to
expect given that none of the trees and
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the history of grape as a species
or a genus is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all wild accessions,
but
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have those been mapped onto a similar
database?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure they've taken that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that project came from a SNP data
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember I said that GBS was better
than SNP chips because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: ascertainment bias?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason SNP chips are bad for some
organisms is because if you have a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crossing clonal crop, so this thing is
not an annual and it's highly
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crossing, you have so much
heterozygosity expected and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that if you use chip technology
to assay a collection, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: miss all of the diversity that wasn't in
the original samples that were used to
[SPEAKER_00]: design the chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if it, I can't really say
because it was not exactly the same
[SPEAKER_00]: collections, first of all, or the same
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it were, we were directly
sequencing with PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was diversity, we found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used a different technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not sure that what they found
would have been representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the other hand, they were
surveying more of the genome, whereas we
[SPEAKER_00]: were only surveying 30 locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to compare those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the conventional
understanding of how grapes evolved in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, I would say this is pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we didn't expect two separate lumps
of North Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might have been unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, as far as identifying
hybrids and mislabeled accessions,
[SPEAKER_00]: this works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This corroborates that sort of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for the powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the computers we had access to were
not powerful enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy needed to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only working on a master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only had him for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't keep it stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stay here for three more
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had had access to more powerful
computers and more time, I think a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly would have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it didn't because of
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know how long ago that explosive
radiation occurred?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot remember what the number is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can look it up for you if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's pre-human.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably pre-human.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The North American and Asian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't as distinct as they look
because if you rotate this thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that these fall in the same
plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested, I can show you a
rotated version of this sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take your mouse and you grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can rotate the whole thing around,
which makes it a lot easier to see but
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to polycom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went with a still image.
[SPEAKER_00]: A still slide for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's sort of like these are in
one plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these make another sort of,
when you rotate it, it sort of looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
