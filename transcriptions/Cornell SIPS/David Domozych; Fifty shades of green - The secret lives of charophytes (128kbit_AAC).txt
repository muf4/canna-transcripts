[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Josh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank the folks in Plant
Biology and at Cornell University for
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing me to do this seminar to tell you
something that's been a passion in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last 35, 36 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to come back to Cornell,
which is one of my most favorite places in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time as a postdoc here was really,
really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every decade or so I come back and it's
really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'd like to do today is start you
off sort of with a very big global
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on a spaceship and you were
coming to the planet Earth, the color that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would see on the planet would be blue,
primarily from all the aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: environments on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were to look at the land masses,
the other color that would be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious is that of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, of course, comes from the
pigments that you get from the great
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of land plants that occupy many,
many, many terrestrial ecosystems on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question that has been
intriguing plant biologists for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time has been, where did land plants come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: From what group of organisms did they come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you went back about 450 million
years, 500 million years, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic plant life might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be some green algae living
probably in a thermal outflow of a shallow
[SPEAKER_00]: wetland area, kind of like what you would
see if you went to Yellowstone National
[SPEAKER_00]: Park and moved away from the really,
really hot springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 450 million years ago,
we went from this up to this over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the group of organisms that we've come
to know as the ancestors of land plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and those most closely related to land
plants are called the caerophytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the more proper taxonomic designation
would be the streptophytes, the basal
[SPEAKER_00]: streptophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you undoubtedly have seen them if
you've gone to any aquatic ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshwater algae, for the most part,
but a unique group of algae, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest group within the green algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted to do, just spend a
minute and talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of the discovery of caerophytes as
being land plant ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really hasn't been all that long
ago that there are other ideas as to where
[SPEAKER_00]: land plants and the whole idea of
multicellularity came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to a point, let's say,
before the 1960s, you would see many
[SPEAKER_00]: different phylogenetic schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the more common ones is you get
something like Clamidomonas as a basal
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would have colonial green
algae that swim, that don't swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to filamentous organisms,
and then branched elements, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: parenchymus tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, please remember that the
technology that was available for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up to interpret what might be
happening out there was somewhat limited
[SPEAKER_00]: based on reproductive biology,
some basic microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, that was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something happened in the 1960s that
really changed the whole equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like many of the new techniques and
protocols and instruments that we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular biology today, in the 1960s and
beyond, it was the electron microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: that changed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 1960s, people started using
glutaraldehyde as a primary fixative for
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing things for TEM, and you got
superior fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to introduce you to some of
the great characters in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: caerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've called this the modern era,
from about the 1960s until today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key pioneers was an Australian
scientist by the name of Jeremy Pickett
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeremy Pickett Heaps was at the
University of Colorado for a long period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, and he was a meticulous
microscopist, a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeremy was a good light microscopist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would take his different green algae,
and he would spend hours just positioning
[SPEAKER_00]: them just right on the light microscope to
see, for example, cell division events,
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a look at reproductive cells,
a variety of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was also an outstanding electron
microscopist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was able to pinpoint specific processes
using thin-section TEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to go down probably to
Mann Library, you'd probably find this
[SPEAKER_00]: book from 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able, from about 1972 to 1975,
in a series of publications to define this
[SPEAKER_00]: group of algae known as the caerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were different names at the time,
but he was one of the first people to
[SPEAKER_00]: champion the idea of caerophytes as land
plant ancestors using ultra-structural
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had other workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Karl Maddox and Ken Stewart from
Miami University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were my major professors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who, about a decade later, came up with a
really nice paper in 1984 giving more
[SPEAKER_00]: definition to the caerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Linda Graham at the University of
Wisconsin, who worked on a very famous
[SPEAKER_00]: caerophyte, Coleokidae, and was looking at
the pattern formation and the formation of
[SPEAKER_00]: parenchymidous tissue or the
parenchymidous tissue-like material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the 1980s, we've also had a
large group of molecular pioneers that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, a lot of the
molecular data that has been used to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the caerophytes really kind of confirms
what people like Picket Heaps and others
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to come up with with the
electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in the 70s and 80s,
really, where a lot of this started to
[SPEAKER_00]: blossom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here's the green algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this big group known as the green
algae, most of the green algae are not
[SPEAKER_00]: caerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They belong to a group that we'll call the
chlorophyta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the chlorophyta, you have
things like your seaweeds, the former
[SPEAKER_00]: albophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now in this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some freshwater filamentous
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the lichen algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clamidomonas fits in this particular
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably the largest and most diverse
group that you have are these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are designated in the presentophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, as Carl Maddox,
my major professor, once said,
[SPEAKER_00]: little round green things that swim or
don't swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really got to believe that because
these are really tiny organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: picoplankton, found in the oceans,
some of the cells may be only a micron or
[SPEAKER_00]: two in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most abundant eukaryotes on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would fit into this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we come to the streptophytes or
the caerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is a group of strange
bedfellows that you find in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology is very, very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see in just a second that the
different forms that you find there are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the caerophytes
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were to look at the extant
caerophytes that are out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's basically two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the early divergent taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within this group, we have an organism
named Mesostigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little round green thing that looks
like a flat and light boat, swims around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of you who are interested in
other parts of biology, this organism
[SPEAKER_00]: produces beautiful layers of scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was one of the organism,
along with some of its cousins,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kindly start to put an end to how a
Golgi apparatus, how a Golgi body works,
[SPEAKER_00]: where in effect, you do have the cisternia
of the Golgi actually move through from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cyst to trans face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the scales actually forming as
opposed to just stationary cisternia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have vesicles taking things from
cisterna to cisterna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorachibus, and unusual and rarely found
terrestrial organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody would like to talk about this
later, I'd love to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorachibus, especially if you're
interested in the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolyzable tannins, unique organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Klebsermidium, an organism whose genome is
the first of the caerophytes to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an organism that you find in many
terrestrial and semi-aquatic areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk through the desert southwest
and you're walking at certain times of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year in the desert, you're not walking on
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sand there, but you hear crunch,
crunch, crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are films of Klebsermidium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people who are interested in the
evolution of land plants are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the late diversion taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have things like Kera and Nitella
that you may have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coleokidae, many species formed as
parenchymidus-like tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hey, kind of looks like a liverwort,
so this would be a good candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has been a popular candidate for what's
the closest living ancestor to land
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the conjugating green
algae, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Klebsermids and filamentous forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirogyra, Mubiosia, you probably have
seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the caerophytes, and here are the
different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until about five or 10 years ago,
there was a question, which of the late
[SPEAKER_00]: divergent forms was the most closely
related to land plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I come from Saratoga Springs,
New York, and we just finished the racing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of like a horse race at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, well, maybe it's going to be
something like Kera, okay, because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's macroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it has higher plant tissue,
has these whorls, but it's basically an
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregation of filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its reproductive structures look like
a land plant, so maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the Coleokidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the Coleokitelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some species have parenchymidus
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have antheridia-like male
reproductive structures and oogonium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the zygotes retained on the plant,
so hey, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got to be the hands-on favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's these freaky
zygnametalian organisms, the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: conjugate.
[SPEAKER_00]: No motile cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about sperm cells
or X cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicellular, some filamentous forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early part of this decade,
there was some molecular work that was
[SPEAKER_00]: being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found out as they were
looking at who was going to win this horse
[SPEAKER_00]: race, it was the zygnametalian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the conjugating green algae that
turn out to be the closest living
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors to land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the organisms that I'm going to
spend quite a bit of time on today,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pentium is a very simple organism,
as you will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pentium, along with Spirogyra,
are believed to be organisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: represent things that are closest to land
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I truly understand that the survey
that has been done looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenomics of all of this has been
really limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until they do more of a survey,
that's all the NSF needs to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's just take a look at
caerophytes that have been used as model
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, caerophytes, in my title,
the word secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they haven't been all that secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used caerophytes as model organisms
for many different biological
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Cava and Nitella are well
known for studies of cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have people in this audience who have
worked on Cava and Nitella and cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful organism for studying
gravitropism and statelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an organism that has been in space,
whether it's real space or whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Coleokidae that has been used as
a model for looking at patterns in tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have organisms like the desmids that
have this beautiful form that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: used in cell morphogenesis and symmetry,
getting particular morphogenetic patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, there's been some great
stuff where looking at cell wall polymers,
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone physiology signaling systems that
are indicating that caerophytes might be
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice organisms for studying some
basic facts about plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I've been working on
caerophytes for a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in about 15 years, years ago,
I got interested in the tremendous amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of polysaccharides produced by caerophytes
that are found in shallow aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to spend most of my time from about
5.30 every morning till 9 out in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting various caerophytes and trying
to get some of the polysaccharides off and
[SPEAKER_00]: characterizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must admit, this was a wonderful
experience for many, many years,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only because you were able to go out
to some really beautiful places,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had one of the best laboratory
collaborators, one of the best laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: managers, if you like, something that was
meticulous, always kept things organized,
[SPEAKER_00]: and made this laboratory perfect almost
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this guy right over here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beavers, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not leave any stick out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you have to do is feed them
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have juicy bark,
they'll work for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested in these blooms and
some of the mass amounts of polysaccharide
[SPEAKER_00]: that are pushed out by these organisms
when they bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these organisms, I am working with
these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a Placoderm desmit, a unicellular
one known as Pentium margaritaceum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This organism was perfect for a lot of
studies looking at cell walls and
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion, as you will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main reasons for this is that
it has a very simple morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an elongate cylinder with rounded
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a typical desmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It follows the job description of a
desmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two semi-cells surrounding the
central zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of other features that
you'll see that make Pentium kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it produces only a primary
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about secondary
cell walls complicating issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it produces these unique
extracellular gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live cells can be labeled with a variety
of probes, including monoclonal
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can place the cells back into
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can watch development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch the expansion dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow and to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It accommodates rapid microwave screening
if you want to apply specific inhibitors
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what happens to secretory events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a very elaborate membrane
network that I'm going to finish up on
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd like to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lean-mean secretory machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a great
organism for understanding secretory
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been doing over the last 10
years is looking at the cell biology of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pentium, especially expansion,
dynamics and membrane trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracellular glycom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also looked at stress biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's what Josh Eben and I have
been working on as a stress biology
[SPEAKER_00]: project sponsored by NSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to give you three different
facets of some of the work that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: done with Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to count like categories
that you find on Jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, I'd like, number one, the real
world, the most favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to your microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to you a little bit about
the unique cell wall, where the expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism is an easy thing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, there is something I would call a
sticky business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third area is membrane
trafficking on a superhighway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get to see what secretion
dynamics are really like with this
[SPEAKER_00]: unicellular organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to start off with the real
world of most kerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to your microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is we have to
recognize that kerophytes and these land
[SPEAKER_00]: plant ancestors lived in semi-aquatic
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from an evolutionary standpoint and
from where they are today, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: unique mechanisms that they used in order
to survive in these habitats that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: drying out, salt content can go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using this quote by a very famous
microbiologist, William Costerton,
[SPEAKER_00]: who about 15 years ago, in the preface of
a book, basically said the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbial life on this planet doesn't
reside in suspensions, but lives in highly
[SPEAKER_00]: complex communities that are attached to
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Costerton was talking about was
that of a biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about these small
kerophytes, especially the zygni-metallian
[SPEAKER_00]: kerophytes, for the most part,
they're stuck to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that they're stuck to can
vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, it's a solid object.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Costerton also said that the interface
between water and air constitutes a
[SPEAKER_00]: surface for the formation of many
biofilms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofilms have been studied primarily in
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at them, one of the things
that you will notice is that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very distinct structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just simple colonies of
bacteria that are covered in slime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have in these colonies, they have
channels, they have specific places where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have different microorganisms that
might be in some kind of symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship appearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key thing is, one of the key
components of the biofilm is a
[SPEAKER_00]: polysaccharide or proteoglycan sheath that
is produced in large amounts that forms
[SPEAKER_00]: these unique habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you that desmids and many
of the kerophytes, including Pentium,
[SPEAKER_00]: are organisms that produce extensive EPS
sheaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about microgram quantities per cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in laboratory culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, it's cheating a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they produce enormous amounts of
polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that seems to be a major
mechanism for these organisms' survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's take a look at the
EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at these with antibodies
raised against the EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cell that had the EPS washed
out and labeled it with its anti-EPS
[SPEAKER_00]: antibody after the cell was kept in
culture for maybe an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's producing incredible amounts of
this polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you could study these things also by
using fluorescent beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at the production rates of EPS
by taking fluorescent beads, incubating or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the cells and incubating in them,
and watch how these fluorescent beads are
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does Pentium and what do these
EPS compounds do for desmids and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other kerophytes?
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it for gliding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they secrete the polysaccharide
from one area of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hygroscopic, so when it comes
out of the backside of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: it swells with water and that propels the
organism in a particular direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, it's used for
enchiefment on a surface and for forming
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linda Graham, who I told you about just a
few minutes ago, she spent some time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late 1990s and early 2000s looking at
some of the bacteria found in the EPS
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm sheets of some kerophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a unique assortment of
nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: salt-take-reducing bacteria that there
really were true biofilm communities
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with these EPS sheets that you
find with things like Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just keep in mind, as you'll get to
see in a little bit, that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: site-specific secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, when they make contact with the
surface and they want to secrete EPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do it in particular parts of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know it's a Friday afternoon and
I'm not going to go into detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what the EPS is is a very complex
polysaccharide or aggregation of
[SPEAKER_00]: polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a galacturonic acid-based
polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glucuronic acid-based
polysaccharide with lots of xylose and
[SPEAKER_00]: sucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a little bit of work on the
composition under high-light conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: under high-temperature conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one particular condition that
really changes the EPS is that of high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, where we lose uronic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a decrease in a couple of the main
sugars, 3-linked sucose and 3,4-linked
[SPEAKER_00]: brannose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terminal galactose residues go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are changes in the polysaccharide
composition under this stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we're doing right now
is taking a look at the EPS and its
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion under various stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the second thing I want to talk
about is that of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this organism only has a
primary cell wall, and the expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics can be studied quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to review for you the primary cell
wall, the cell wall that is produced when
[SPEAKER_00]: an organism is expanding, remember we have
cellulose, which is the load-bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: component of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cross-linking hemicelluloses and
pectins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pentium, the thing that sort of hits
you right between the eyes are the
[SPEAKER_00]: pectins, because it has it advertised on
its surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pectins are polymers of galacturonic acid
and other sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture is a little bit
complicated, but you could have several
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of pectin subdomains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have pectin just made up of
galacturonic acid, and those would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: homogalacturonans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could come to some of the
most complicated biopolymers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet, things called the
ramnogalacturonans, and in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: ramnogalacturonan 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side chains are extremely,
extremely diverse, and they can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very complex polysaccharide to
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in the smooth
pectin, the homogalacturonans that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any side chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RG1, ramnogalacturonan 1, and that's
the hairy pectin, and that's primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has these side chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so with Pentium, what did we
find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, along with coworkers at the
University of Copenhagen, we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated cell walls and looked at the
chemical composition, and then some
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate microarray analysis using a
variety of different monoclonal antibodies
[SPEAKER_00]: was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have Pentium cell walls that
were basically separated into a CDTA,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pectin fraction, then an NaOH or a more
hemicellulosic fraction, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: catoxin fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find in Pentium is that we
have the pectins, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: homogalacturonan, and we have RG1,
we have cellulose, we have ramnogalactam
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, and I really don't have time to
talk about, nor can I tell you much about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other polymers, but in many
ways similar to what you find in land
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a similar study at the University
of Georgia, the Complex Carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Center, and what you find are,
once again, your pectins, and then a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of ramnogalactam something or
others, whether you belong to RG1 or AGPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a big mystery in actually many areas
of cell wall biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the Pentium cell wall look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can get cell walls off Pentium
quite easily, and that's by sonicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do complex extractions,
you just grow the cells up, put them on
[SPEAKER_00]: ice, put a little bit of detergent into a
buffer, and sonicate them, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that is most outstanding,
represented by this inner circle over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, is what we call the pectin lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is homogalacturonan that is complex
with calcium to form a very distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a series of very thickened fibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are branched, they come
together, and they terminate outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you were, let's say, a microorganism
landing on the Pentium surface and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get a side view, this is what it
would probably look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could then use a little bit of
chelator, and you can remove some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, and what you can see,
hopefully, are literally thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrils, about one to two nanometers,
in thickness, that are probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: homogalacturonan that is complex,
the calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and then from a TEM standpoint,
this is what the wall looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that homogalacturonan lattice,
and what happens is, is that it enters
[SPEAKER_00]: into the inner wall layer made up of
cellulose, and this zone right over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: these little sort of indentations that you
see that are semi-electron dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's called the medial layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a pectin outer wall,
a smooth pectin outer wall, or
[SPEAKER_00]: homogalacturonan acid outer wall,
and then we have this medial layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a cellulose inner layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do some immunolabeling, we can use a
monoclonal antibody called Jim-5 that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: after relatively low esterified pectins,
homogalacturonan, and it is located here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lattice, and also in this medial
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use antibodies, that goes after the
backbone, not the side chains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the backbone of RG1, what you will
find is that it is only found in this
[SPEAKER_00]: medial layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, this is my model,
nobody else's, and you'll have to forgive
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I'm not an artist, but you might think
I am, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have cellulose forming the
basis of the wall, and then here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the homogalacturonan coming out,
and then the RG1 is the thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: anchoring the homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we're probably looking at some
monster pectin domain, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: recently described by Liton and Deborah
Monan at the University of Georgia,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're not really dealing with
separate polymers, we're just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different geographic domains of pectins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pectins are really complicated,
and just to speculate a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be that the RG1, the black
component here, is the thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually interacting with cellulose,
and more and more evidence suggests that
[SPEAKER_00]: pectins are more important than maybe some
of the classic hemicelluloses in the way a
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so then I just want to let you
know that the homogalacturonan can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: label using fluorescent probes,
and you could then study subsequent pectin
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion dynamics, you could study
expansion dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to point out one quick
thing, so here's GIMP-5, and GIMP-5 has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a very good antibody for labeling
Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could label it, put the cells back
into culture, and then you'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: the zone here in the middle is going to be
where new wall material is produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you look at the zone, you'll see
this is the lattice, this is what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to spend a minute and tell
you about some new valuable probes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used for studying pectins in plant
cells, and they're really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can just remember what those,
excuse me, those SEM images of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: lattice looked like, and then take a look
at something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is one of the new probes used
for labeling pectins, and what makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice is that you can actually see
some of those thickened fibers coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far more detail than we got using the
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These probes that I'm going to describe to
you are wonderful because they're small
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular weight, much smaller than using
antibodies, and they can penetrate deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cell wall and provide you with a
lot of wonderful detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what are these probes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, why can, what are they doing to give
you this wonderful detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of them is called the reciprocal
oligosaccharide probe, and I must tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really easy, and these were developed
by a person named Josef Mravec at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Copenhagen, and here's the
way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here's a typical
homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the galacturonic acids that are
lined up, and these blue dots over here
[SPEAKER_00]: are to represent the methyl groups that
are attached to the carboxylic acid group
[SPEAKER_00]: that you typically find in pectins that
have not yet been secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense to, in effect, neutralize
the negative charges on the carboxylic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid groups because the pectin would be
too sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would stick into vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most pectins are produced that are
methylated, the homogalacturonan,
[SPEAKER_00]: the galacturonic acid residues are
methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically what happens in the
development of pectins when it's secreted
[SPEAKER_00]: is they get deesterified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're deesterified by an enzyme,
a well-known enzyme known as pectin
[SPEAKER_00]: methylesterase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll mention that in just a minute,
but what you do is you remove the methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, and here is, and here are your
negatively charged galacturonic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wouldn't it be a great idea to get
something that is roughly the same size as
[SPEAKER_00]: this that might have a positive charge
that you can match up, and you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take chitin or chitosan
fragments, and what you can do is add them
[SPEAKER_00]: to pectins, and you could get the chitosan
fragments at different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerization, and they'll match up with
the pectin, with the homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is you can add a tag,
a fluorescent tag, a gold tag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where you get some really,
really beautiful pictures, one of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: probes being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reciprocal oligosaccharide probes,
in this case, one called CAS, is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are binding positively charged amino
groups on chitosan oligosaccharides with
[SPEAKER_00]: that of the carboxylic acid groups on the
oligogalacturonides, a wonderful type of
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that's even easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oligogalacturonides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture is a little difficult to
discern, but the blue little squiggles,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the homogalacturonan, and the
little yellow dots in there, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have homogalacturonan after it's
been deesterified, and what will happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: you have calcium coming in, and it will
form these links, and that's where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something like the lattice that you see in
Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, the brilliant idea that
they had was, what about if we were to
[SPEAKER_00]: take known oligogalacturonide fragments
and put a probe on it, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: like alexifluor 488, and then incubate
cells where the pectin was just being
[SPEAKER_00]: secreted, and as it was deesterified,
it would match up with these external
[SPEAKER_00]: oligogalacturonides that have alexifluor
488.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these conjugates have been very,
very helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just this past year in the plant
kernel, Yosef had a nice, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: screening of many different plants that
use this, and this is where you get these
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, wonderful new probes that are
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's the pectin component
of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner wall layer is made of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, here's the outer wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner layer has cellulose in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a colabel of calcifluor with the
antibody GIM5, and you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another probe that we have been using
that's just come out recently is a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate binding module that goes
after crystal and cellulose, but
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers in Portugal had an ingenious
idea, and what they've done is they've
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked GFP on it, and therefore you could
pick up cellulose microfibrils that are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then use CBM, carbohydrate binding
modules, or GFP, to label the cellulose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's the pectin on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inner wall layer consists of
cellulose and different orientations of
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose microfibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so cellulose is the load-bearing
component of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the thing that's holding the wall
together, not the pectins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have not a really certain clue as
to what the pectin lattice is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably something to do with adhesion,
but when you do some simple experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: like you use a microtubule inhibitor like
APM, you get rid of the cortical
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules that are found in the cell
center, and you weaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cause the cellulose wall to be thinner
because microtubules are controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: deposition of cellulose, and then you get
trigger pressure causing these swellings,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what about treating your cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: In an EDTA, a pylator solution,
we could get rid of the pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jim-5 label, and the cell could be
put back into culture, and ultimately it
[SPEAKER_00]: will produce more pectin, but for several
days it doesn't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can put the cells in pectate lyase,
and you could literally strip off the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer layer, fluorescent image with Jim-5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your SEM, here's your TM,
and this is a cell that's labeled with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim-5, not a speck of the
homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the cell in the culture, it's as happy
as can be, and in a couple of days it will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the wall expand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the wall expands from the center on
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make this a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The center of the cell where the nucleus
is, that is called the isthmus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the zone where new wall materials
are produced, and it pushes old wall
[SPEAKER_00]: material out, so basically the cell is
expanding in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cartoon gives you maybe a little
better idea of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This zone right over here would be new
wall, gets more and more walls pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: old wall out, and then ultimately you get
cell division with daughter cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, lackaderm desmids have that
symmetry, but it's a very easy thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how expansion occurs,
and the central zone is known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: isthmus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what we have done is we have
looked at isthmus zone expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that you have pectins,
homogalacturonans that are
[SPEAKER_00]: methylesterified that are secreted here in
this central zone, this isthmus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they are deesterified by pectin
methylesterase, and now we go to gym five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is where this would be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gym seven label here, the
esterified pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dark zone over here is where this
would be found, and then over on either
[SPEAKER_00]: side you have the pectin that has become
deesterified and picked up calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pectin is now being pushed to the
outside and the cellulose as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get this bipolar displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an FESEM view showing, we believe,
some of the pectin homogalacturonan
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrils before they have complexed calcium
and formed this particular lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cellulose is the first polymer
that is produced in this expansion zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microfibrils are deposited in
perpendicular direction to the direction
[SPEAKER_00]: of expansion, and they're associated with
a cortical band of microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is just a simple section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the cellulose here in the isthmus
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the lattice that's being
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a glancing section where you can
see the cellulose microfibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in this orientation, and cell
expansion is going in this horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the cell just underneath
the plasma membrane, you have a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: cortical microtubules that are probably
directing the way in which cellulose is
[SPEAKER_00]: deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellulose, of course, is made by sese
complexes on the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the cortical microtubule band
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so shortly after the cellulose is
produced, the RG1 is deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with the antibody INRA-RU1 that I
showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start to see the lattice that
starts to form and starts pushing out the
[SPEAKER_00]: old cell wall material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell wall has some sticky business,
and the sticky business is adhesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take cells and you place them on a
substrate, and on that substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you let them sit for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come together, and they will
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will ad-fix to a substrate very,
very firmly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in what this sticky
stuff might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could take some beads, polyser
beads, and put them around the cell that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just been washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a matter of seconds,
there's something sticky on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's responsible for this stickiness
that allows the cell to adhere to some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can use a monoclonal antibody
known as GYM13, which is probably the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for identifying arabinogalactam
proteins in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that on the outer
surface of the wall, you get a very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct label.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GYM13 labeling is on the outer surface
of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do the colabeling with calciflor or
with two antibodies, a pectin antibody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably the better picture to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the GYM13 in red, and over here in
green is the GYM5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's found on the outside of the pectin
lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GYM13 material also adheres to
substrates, and it leaves a footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a cell that was placed on a cover
slit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just left it there just for a few
minutes, and then we pushed the cell off,
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the footprint, and you can see
where some of the GYM13 label came off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears to be the glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Western analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have found in using GYM13,
we find that we have a couple of high
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular weight bands here in cell wall
fractions, and also we find it in the EPS
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not exactly sure what this means
here, but it probably means some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adhesive material has been sloughed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in addition to that EPS,
that gel that is produced on the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just real quickly, if we look at
the TEM, here's that pectin lattice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's the fibrils that are GYM13
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's sort of an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: It forms sort of like a little reticulated
network here on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immunogold labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's GYM13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It corresponds to what we saw with
immunofluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there appears to be a fibrillar layer
of arabinogalactan proteins that are found
[SPEAKER_00]: on the outside and maybe important in
sticking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer fibrillar layer is not attached
to the homogalacturonan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get rid of the homogalacturonan,
and these fibrils will still appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into the inner part of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pectin lattice is for at least part
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a story that's still being
told.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we could strip off the outer
homogalacturonan, and there are the
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outer fibrillar layer is laid down
at the isthmus very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the isthmus zone in an expanding
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And already we see that there are these
ATP-like fibrils that we're calling them
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP-like fibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this sticky material is very,
very significant, and we find it in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something Trevor suggested back last
year was, why do we not take a look and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what happens if we incubate the cells
with something like phospholipase C to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if there might be an anchor that's found
in the plasma membrane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you have these AGPs going through
the wall and anchoring in the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to make a long story short,
here's our control cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's phospholipase C-treated cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lose most of the AGP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a TEM image, and this is a zone
where during phospholipase treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've lost those particular fibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that AGPs and AGP-like
molecules are responsible for adhesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to end this particular
part by just saying is that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about AGPs in carapytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may have been very important in the
evolution of land plants, a sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: material, that if we look at things like
spirogyra, and we wound spirogyra
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments, they form these rhizoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you label them with Jim-13,
the only time you ever see Arabinogalactam
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins is in the wound response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or here in that organism, chlorachibis
that I mentioned, the oddball of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carapytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its sheath, which allows it to stick to
substrates, is made of AGP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AGP may be the superglue of carapytes,
and they have been very, very important in
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, what I'd like to just do is
just tell you some just real quick things
[SPEAKER_00]: about membrane trafficking in the
spinarvism-like tenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, how does a plant cell
expand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we should know that it expands
basically because of two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The force that's causing expansion is that
of internal turgor pressure, and the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and modifications of the cell wall to
causing slippage of the cellulose
[SPEAKER_00]: microfibrils allows for controlled
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the world of plants, we have
diffusive polar growth mechanisms where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have wall polymers added to different
possibly evenly distributed areas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get sort of a more even
expansion of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the opposite end of that spectrum,
you get polar growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where wall synthesis,
like in a pollen tube or a root here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is concentrated here at the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in penium, to finish the story up,
right, penium expansion dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to leave you with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This organism is a lean, lean
polysaccharide producing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this organism, like many of the
desmids, is a perfect organism for
[SPEAKER_00]: studying secretory dynamics in plant
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I just want to
reiterate is that it's here in this zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: right over here, in the isthmus,
where we have the wall materials produced
[SPEAKER_00]: at first and being secreted at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell wall expansion requires a very
distinct cytoskeletal network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of an intriguing thing
that we were studying a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do immunolabeling for the
cortical microtubular network in penium,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you find in a normal cell before
expansion is you find a band of
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubules, cortical microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what happens is before expansion,
you get satellite bands appearing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start to move away from the
mother strand as the cell starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand.
Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in this picture over here,
you can see they're starting to move away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to mark the zone where
the isthmus is in the daughter cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cell hasn't even divided yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, in many ways, predicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a pre-prophase band.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's predicting the plane of cell division
two division cycles away, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's identifying where the isthmus is
going to be in the daughter cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens is when the cell goes
into cell division, we lose this cortical
[SPEAKER_00]: microtubular band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably contributing to the
spindle and also to the cytokinetic
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at the daughter cells,
here is, OK, it was over here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: mother cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the daughter cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this particular band.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cortical microtubular bands were
kind of a surprise to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just real quick, they had multiple
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had multiple functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They marked the plane of division.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a source of microtubules for the
spindle and the cytokinetic apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably direct cellulose synthesis
involved in nuclear movement, which
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly we could talk about a unique way
of moving the nucleus in desmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have cortical actin bands that
are very important in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's rhodomyphilidin labeling of
Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ropes, these cables of actin,
are found in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time of expansion, what will
happen is you get these bands that line up
[SPEAKER_00]: with those cortical microtubule bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very likely that this
cytoskeletal network, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cytomodal network is interfacing with
the cytoskeletal network for the accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery of secretory materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key thing here is the secretory
apparatus of Pentium is truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to just point out to you
is that here's Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dark zones over here are valleys
of cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have big vacuoles in this
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are vacuoles, but they're small and
meandering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in these little zones over here that
you have the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the fun things start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a simple longitudinal
section of Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went on a hunt to see how many gold
g-bodies a single cell has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just one portion of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think there's between 125 and 150
gold g-bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we take a look at is what
does Pentium have that's different than
[SPEAKER_00]: higher plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get close to this, this is my
performance art part of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in higher plants, I'm a gold g-body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gold g-bodies in Arabidopsis,
for example, they're moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden, they need to secrete
something over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll dock in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the gold g-star shoots things
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen in Desmis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly doesn't happen in
Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, what they have over here is they
produce a series of vesicles that get
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up on that actin network here on
the periphery of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have a ready supply of secret
or vesicles for EPS, for wall material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the stuff that's modal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever they need that material,
some kind of signal cascade probably
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get those vesicles to that zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start secreting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for other Desmids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold g-bodies are not mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stuck in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just real quick, the gold g-bodies are
quite unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of cisterni.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a trans-gold g-network.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you people who are cell
biologists, let me just point out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a secretory vesicle
associated with a TGN in Pentium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what you find in land
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each gold g-body can produce both wall
materials and the EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPS secretion can be focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a cell that was placed on a
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fixed it for electron microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at this zone where EPS was
being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the EM picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about this, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the substrate down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see in this zone, where the
cell is attached, we have these vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: that pull and release the EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there obviously are some interesting
signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wall expansion zone, we have wall
vesicles that will come up and contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to pectins and to whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also think we've identified a group of
small vesicles, probably containing CESA,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to come into this
particular zone as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know for certain, but that's an
ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is that there is an
endocytic pathway in Pentium and in all
[SPEAKER_00]: desmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really quite distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use things like the FM dyes,
464, 143, and the dots I is immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets on the cytoplasmic streaming
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come together and fuse in a
very distinct vacuolar network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these vacuoles are autophagic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got membranes in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a very unique vacuolar system that's
involved in endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, let me just say that if
you're interested in secretory dynamics in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the production of cell walls or
whatever, this is an organism that I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for only $9.95, I'll give you no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an organism that I think has
tremendous potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll forget this particular picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me finish up by saying that there
are many, many different projects that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking into.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into stress in secretory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the way in which the
cytoskeleton and the membrane trafficking
[SPEAKER_00]: network work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't bore you with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'd like to finish up and say,
first of all, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank many, many people,
Sandra and Lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra's a postdoc in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lily is our microscopy whiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many undergraduates who are just
invaluable in contributing to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the best collaborators that,
well, the best collaborators I've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life with Ethan and Joss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me the money later.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoe Popper from the National University of
Ireland, or Dr. Kakaki from University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis, William Willetts, and these folks
from the University of Copenhagen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, being unicellular now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not ever seen anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So production of so much EPS, so that
would require a lot of investment of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering whether there are any
adaptations in photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they better at assimilating carbon
that allows them to put so much carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: into EPS production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't tell you the details because
I don't know the details of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, there is a tremendous
amount of photosynthate that is directed
[SPEAKER_00]: into EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow these things in culture
under high light conditions, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: EPS, for example, over, let's say,
a 24-hour period will increase three
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this EPS means something to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put a lot of photosynthetic
material into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I've always had about
organisms like this and other caerophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are found, for example, in these
ephemeral pools is you'll see these things
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll produce this incredible amount
of EPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like green jello.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about a week later, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the eco-dynamics of this and what
that's being used for in the carbon cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: of that ecosystem, nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the endomembrane system look in
the universe?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no Golgi bodies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most of the time before expansion,
you have the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have cytoplasm around the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see the typical vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's no very little ER and no Golgi
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the lobes, the cytoplasmic
lobes that are defined by the chloroplast.
The vesicles that get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the active network goes all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at, for example,
vesicles and you want to see what happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just doesn't stop at the isthmus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somewhere during expansion,
obviously, pools of all
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor-containing vesicles are pulled
off into the isthmus for the expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The current phylogenetic position of this
side of the hemispheres has always
[SPEAKER_03]: intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they're really the sister group
to the endomebranes, they've lost a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've lost flagella.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've lost so many things that you
wouldn't have thought would be in the
[SPEAKER_03]: nearest ancestors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So could I get some reaction from you
regarding these strange characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only thing I could tell you is
what Charles Delwich at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland has reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his point is it's been an evolutionary
reduction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't really explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my follow-up question, which maybe
you can anticipate.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of what you just described is
possibly unique to this highly derived
[SPEAKER_00]: group?
[SPEAKER_00]: It very well could be, because they've had
450 million years as well to, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that there is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point I was trying to make is that
as far as looking for basic subcellular
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics, this would be... But I agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a really fascinating story
right now about the phylogeny of
[SPEAKER_00]: late-divergent paraphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a story that I think is going to
be... We're going to learn a lot when we
[SPEAKER_00]: get more genomes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go, let's thank David Blomstein
for a fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
