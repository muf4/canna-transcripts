[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for inviting me to
give this seminar today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is a plant pathology seminar,
and I'm going to talk about insect
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a little bit of plant
pathology later on in the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for disclaimer purposes, I'm not
going to take any questions or comment on
[SPEAKER_00]: any political implications that impact or
have impacted the research that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and the potential for continuing the
project or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how the technology went
from all the innovation to how it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted in Bangladesh and the impact that
we've seen so far, what we think is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen in the future with this
technology and the opportunities that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm going to focus on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we are going to focus on
the partnerships that made this project
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been about 20 years of investment
and collaboration between organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm currently the project director for
the current investment from USA into BTX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why BTX?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_00]: So eggplant is the second most important
vegetable in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in this picture,
there is a lot of diversity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the eggplants that we consume
here are not necessarily part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that you see in Bangladeshi
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 100 different varieties,
types of eggplants are grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important as we continue to
talk about how our technology has been
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's grown by 150,000 resource for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the challenge that they face
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eggplant fruit and shoot border can
reduce yield by about 70% even after
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive use of insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladeshi farmers spread about 100 times
in one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 times insecticides that are
neurotoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that have never grown
an eggplant, eggplant is not something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you harvest once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will harvest over a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the implications of that
for insecticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are spraying insecticide without any
safety gear, any protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you are spraying, you're also going
to be harvesting on the same day or the
[SPEAKER_00]: day after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily a person,
the person that is going to be using the
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide will be an adult or somebody
that has been trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be the children in the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be elderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be women.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be young people spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about why was this so
important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this intervention so necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a scientific curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because the technology was just
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because there is a true need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cryo-A1C gene from bacillus
thuringiensis can render eggplant
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single gene can provide the resistance
for the fruit and shoot border.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the major past of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other minor pasts that impact the
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fruit and shoot border is the
major.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company in Mexico had developed BT
eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico is a company in India that many
here at Cornell are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had this cryo-A1C gene incorporated into
eggplant through what is called the EE1
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a transgenic crop that was
developed in the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that collaboration with
Cornell, with Sargura Sethguru Consultant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research
Institute as the recipients of that
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, but broader interaction with
the Bangladeshi government, Mexico gave
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology to BARTY, licensed that
technology free of charge and free of
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can produce BT eggplant
varieties that are adapted for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were varieties that already
existed in BARTY.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bangladesh Agricultural Research
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have developed it based on their
market knowledge and the knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: their scientists and their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are varieties that were already
adapted to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the gene was then inserted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was not varieties that were coming
from somewhere abroad without being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to clarify that because I know
that many of the GMO crops that we think
[SPEAKER_00]: about, we think about multinationals that
introduce their high rates or varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: into a country and hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was very well thought and planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was highly consulted with the
Bangladeshi Research Institute and
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 2004 to 2009, these varieties were
developed through back-crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine popular varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In October of 2013, four varieties were
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the Minister of
Agriculture, Madhya Choudhury,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing the first BT eggplant seeds to
20 farmers in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 farmers in 2014 received the first
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you about the political
willingness that was necessary and was
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have innovation, we have science,
and then we have political will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have involvement of the relevant
stakeholders in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of showcase here,
all these institutions that were involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in this collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only the Bangladesh Agricultural
Research Institute that it will be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the counterpart of the USDA,
but then also a arm of the organization
[SPEAKER_00]: that produces seeds, because we're going
to hear that then it's not only bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology to the country,
but then how do we produce seeds to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we needed to do outreach
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Farming Future Bangladesh
that is a group of young journalists and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicators that do outreach in the
community, understand the culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the values of the culture,
understand the language, kind of speak the
[SPEAKER_00]: language, reaching out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Cornell, we have the
Ministry of Agriculture, and we have Seth
[SPEAKER_00]: Guru that helps broker that relationship
between the private and the public
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations that then turn out to be
this private-public partnership that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been so successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 2014, when 20 farmers received the
first seeds in four districts,
[SPEAKER_00]: now through all this collaboration through
these organizations, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration plots, involving the
extension agents, producing seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that the seed is pure,
that has good quality, and coordinating
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts across them, now we have over
65,000 farmers every year growing BT
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These varieties are open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is it's great that
farmers can keep seed of it, but it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it very challenging to know where the seed
is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are making some assumptions based on
seed that has been distributed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also we know that based on our studies
that about 15 to 25% farmers may be
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping seed for next season or passing on
to their neighbors or their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the number may be much
higher because we cannot keep track of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed that is in the market in addition
to the formal seed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the four varieties that were
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, this is the diversity
that I was talking to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have green eggplant, purple
eggplant, pink eggplant, with striation,
[SPEAKER_00]: with no striation, elongated, round,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different varieties that they
like for different dishes for different
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now even to the point that even within a
variety, they will be looking at in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, let's say this green variety that
is very large, some families will be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for smaller fruit because they
only have four people in the family or two
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to feed a family of
seven anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want a small fruit so they don't
waste food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is important when you're
talking about a vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I forgot to mention and that it
may be relevant is that most people think
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we think about insecticides or
pesticides in general, that are these
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity crops, the ones that consume the
most, but a lot of the pesticides are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually used in vegetables and fruit
because economically, you can make a case
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we like our fruits and vegetables
to be damage-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also high value of these products
in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when the farmer has to do the
math, they say, well, if I protect my
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, I really get a revenue even if I
have to apply the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the numbers that we're getting
after the adoption of BT eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on an independent study,
we're seeing negligible fruit infestation
[SPEAKER_00]: in BT eggplant compared to 45% in non-BT
eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a 61% saving on pesticide costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 40% of the cost of production is
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a 61% reduction on
insecticide cost use just from one single
[SPEAKER_00]: gene in this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a six-time increase in farmers' net
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a 21% increase in gross revenue and
about 20% higher fruit yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruit yield here comes in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the variety yield is better,
but every fruit is marketable or has a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to be marketable because it does
have the damage from these pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, at the market level,
once the fruit is in the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: every fruit that is in the market can be
marketable again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the kitchen level,
the people that are buying the fruit can
[SPEAKER_00]: consume the entire fruit because there's
no damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know what the border
causes, it's having a warm inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit or having the larvae growing inside
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the kitchen level, the person will
have to cut away and throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you do with your potatoes
when there's some damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when it's highly
damaged and now you can consume the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about not only yield,
but food loss and food waste at the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: level and the kitchen, all of this is
reduced because of this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see about 41% reduction in
toxicity from the pesticides used based on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own reports of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the farmers and the
household.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the current investment since this
technology since 2014 has been so
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in terms of getting adoption
and getting track in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we wanted to do was to increase that
adoption and the long-term sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: because now we know that technology is
accepted, is in those four varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers are growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we protect this technology not
only for Bangladesh, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding region?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Bt we know can be overcome by the
pests if it's not properly protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the IRIB that is the insect
resistant eggplant partnership project,
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is to scale up the adoption of
these four varieties that carry that tri
[SPEAKER_00]: A1C gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to develop the next generation of
Bt eggplant in this case, hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hybrids are really important because
since the technology was developed and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was developed for resource for farmers,
and the idea was that, well, if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: resource for farmers, let's make sure that
it's open pollinated so they can maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That culture has changed significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are buying hybrids because they
know the return of investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying hybrids of potato,
of peppers, of tomato, of eggplant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see the numbers later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the culture has changed not
only in Bangladesh, but in South Asia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia in general and Africa too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the farmers are risk adverse,
but they will try things once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they see a return on investment,
they will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, if they don't see any
good return on investment, they're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will not buy hybrids if it
doesn't make sense to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are buying hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know by a fact that there is a
market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also we need a reason,
a way to strengthen the value chain
[SPEAKER_00]: because the value chain goes from all the
way from the seed development all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we make that value chain more
inclusive for different people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, different segments?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do we do more outreach and
education for people that are not aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that technology or may have some
misinformation or just really are curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and can get the right
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes not only the public,
the consumer, but the scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and the policymakers that are
making the decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to improve the enabling
environment for BTA plant and biotech in
[SPEAKER_00]: general in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we are involved in supporting the
commercialization of BTA plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about the
Philippines today because that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take another hour to go over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this through ensuring high quality
seed availability of market preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it by increasing adoption of the
existing eggplant so that it can reach
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond those four initial district or the
eight district that we're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that again, the agriculture
and the consumer preferences are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more opportunities for eggplant
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it also by enhancing the
distribution, providing effective
[SPEAKER_00]: technology stewardship, again,
to protect that technology and increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the value for farmers and consumers while
reducing the environmental impact of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh has such an intensive
agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think eggplant is an example,
but many other vegetable crops are having
[SPEAKER_00]: the same challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means the same amount of
insecticides or more and other pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going not only into the fruit and
vegetables and other crops, but also to
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, the soil, insecticides that are
broad spectrum that are eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the BTA can be so specific and allow
for beneficial insects to survive and
[SPEAKER_00]: support the rest of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is done through a very diverse
group of people in my team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is beautiful to have diversity in
terms of perspective, knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise, age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are willing to go to the
field and talk to the farmers or talk can
[SPEAKER_00]: reach to women working in agriculture,
people that can reach to policymakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can have the potential to
translate that basic science to
[SPEAKER_00]: policymakers and to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work very closely with all of these
group of amazing scientists to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an international community
supporting the national scientists in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of the group of
scientists that we employ in Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_00]: and I represent Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the number of scientists that
are reaching out to the government office,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are reaching out through extension
agents, that are reaching out to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed producers, that are working with the
scientists to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is flowing on time to the right
place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see a little bit of the,
how the adoption has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to point out here,
so you can see an increase, significant
[SPEAKER_00]: increase of adoption of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the different sources of
seed, this is what we used to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people are growing BT eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here, for example,
a big dip in 2021, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was not this adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was access to seed, the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that told us that we needed to
be more proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that the seed was getting to
the farmers at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the intensification of agriculture
in Bangladesh only allows you a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time to get these seed to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't catch it at the right
time, the weather may not be conducive or
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer thinking, you know what,
I'm not going to get the yield that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting from this crop because they
needed to be planted three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I don't plant it right now,
I'm not planting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that the seed was not available
that year through communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we start putting more seed
out there, we saw a lot more farmers also
[SPEAKER_00]: growing BT eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, this is taking into account not
the seed that was produced, but the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: was distributed and we take into account
what was returned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are actual numbers of seed that
was distributed to farmers and to dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we have right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three different streams,
four varieties that were released in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first kind of block that you
see here, these four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have two additional new products
that are in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what is called BTB Gun 10 and
11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are right now being back crossed
through again, that collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahiko.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our third pipeline of products is
this hybrid products that are also under
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take a moment to kind of
explain a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions between all of the different
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Bangladesh, these are all the
organizations that are actively involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have BARDI, that is the
Agricultural Research Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have BADC, that is that seed arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have what is called DAE,
that is the extension arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them have a particular
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are producing like the
nuclear seed or breeder seed, foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they do quality assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then do the production of seed for
packaging and to get it to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through the dealer networks that
exist in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the distribution and sell
that happened from that dealer through
[SPEAKER_00]: extension agents, to farmers coming to the
dealers or through informal systems too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we are adding this layer of,
another layer of access to the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: that is through using nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was something that we started
developing because we realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are also going to the nurseries
like we do here in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start looking at for those seedlings
so you can save some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Bangladesh, it's really important
because if you have these frames and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have planted and the rains come in,
you may lose your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by having seedlings, you're adding
some flexibility to your planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can recover in case of you lost
that seed that you planted early,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy seedlings and then being able
to plant them right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're winning, you're gaining all
those three or four weeks instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: having to deal with dumping off in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can have your seedling and you
have a better stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at different ways for
increasing the accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of farmer demonstration
plots that continue to have to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are more and more farmers
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also learning that there's a lot
of farmers that are still not aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the seed packages look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the corner, you can see we include
how the field needs to be planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for BT eggplant to protect the
technology, what we do is that we have BT
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant planted as traditionally in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put a border of non-BT
eggplant to protect that technology by
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the insect to reproduce in those
non-BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not putting a lot of selection
pressure on the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, because we only have about 10%
of the potential eggplant hectares and
[SPEAKER_00]: acreages in Bangladesh, we're not
concerned about the lack of refuge,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call refuge that is the non-BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that as adoption increases,
this will be more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making sure the farmers are used
to planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we know that the reality is quite
different in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are thinking about every single
inch of that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why would I plant it to
something that I will lose if I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: spread?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or then we say, well, you cannot just
spread to eliminate because the goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have the pest going into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we suggested to them was,
if you're not going to plant this isoline,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is BT eggplant, think about it,
all the other varieties that you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we only have four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said, oh, in your household,
you want to plant the pink one,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, or the long purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant that in the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of making it plant an isoline,
plant any other eggplant that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just put it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can harvest that one for
consumption in addition to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have seen in every single country,
even in the US, farmers are not planting
[SPEAKER_00]: those rare fish as expected for BT corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we ended with resistance in
the pest population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I was telling you about
these nurseries that we started
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about now 400 nurseries that
are producing seedlings of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going really well because the
farmers have a new option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also started having nurseries that are
led by women.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is empowering women through
nursery enterprise model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to learning about BT
eggplant, they get the chance to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about finance, bookkeeping, marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been extremely rewarding to see
how these women are starting to work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they create their own network.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have Facebook pages marketing their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the signs and everything because
they're learning about how to market
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was that through the value
chain, what are the entry points for women
[SPEAKER_00]: and for youth in nurseries?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a good way for them to participate of
the benefits of that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see in the picture some of
the women that are working together and
[SPEAKER_00]: having those nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do, we provided some basic
infrastructure and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea is that from the initial
season where they sell, they save and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to buy then seed for the future
or improving their infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: BART is also involved in the compliance of
testing that the seed has the protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the technology continues to be
effective in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to monitor that technology in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is technology that can be used
for all their purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have learned how to use ELISA and
now it's just a technology that they use
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes beyond capacity building for
the technology adoption, but capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: building in the biotechnology unit at
BART.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are responsible as the owners
of that technology for all the compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do the field compliance and they
also do what is called IRM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to not only make sure that
the seed has the protein at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: level that contains the BT gene,
but also that the pathogen is not evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: to have resistance to BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they collect the insect and bring it to
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collect the BT and wait for the
insect to die and to determine if there
[SPEAKER_00]: any resistance buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, we haven't observed
anything that suggests that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup of the resistance in the pest
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have a lot of refuge of non-BT
in the field, but we know that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: if, if, it is when.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, having that capacity in country
is essential for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have these other two varieties
that are coming to market in 2026 is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea again, they have two
completely different market classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can add to the market classes that
we can serve, but they have higher yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges that the
previous varieties have is it can only be
[SPEAKER_00]: planted in the winter because in the
summer season, that is the large season
[SPEAKER_00]: for eggplant, they are susceptible to
wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the difference when you have a
director that are the project that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: entomologist, but versus having a director
that is a plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I realized, I'm like,
how we didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're working on bringing wilt
resistant and working with Adam in our
[SPEAKER_00]: unit, we're trying to understand better
the population of the pathogen and of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt pathogen on the ground, but because
it's a solanaceous problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we not only, it will be relevant for
eggplant, but for also other solanaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope that we can bring some level of
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is already some evidence of
tolerance of the wilt in the body breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, but we know we don't have
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk a little bit more if I have
time on what we're doing in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is first understand the
pathogen population so we can then inform
[SPEAKER_00]: our breeding strategies for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do we have a proper protocols in
body so they can test for this tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: to bacterial wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to the public sector
engagement that we have been talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: with the private sector, now we're also
looking at private to private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenges of producing seed,
the public sector is not set up to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for a much larger population of
farmers growing BT eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inefficient, it's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the body can continue to produce
the breeder seed and the foundation seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what we hope is that private
sector that is better set up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: network to reach how more farmers and
produce seed can come in into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with this idea of there is a
market for hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can serve that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The open pollinated varieties can continue
to be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hybrids can fit into a
completely different market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the information that we have at
the moment that about 40% of the eggplant
[SPEAKER_00]: acreage is being grown to hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, local hybrids developed by
national and international companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming to Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a 40% of a market that we could
enter and reduce the use of pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're already growing hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if these hybrids contain the BT?
[SPEAKER_00]: So through again, collaboration between
Cornell, Sathguru and private sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have identified potential partners that
can work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're partners that have shown
interest on entering the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to make investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Indian companies that are
interested to work with Bangladeshi
[SPEAKER_00]: company to have licensing agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also Bangladeshi company to
say, I want my own hybrids with BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I work up getting just my hybrids
being converted instead of you sending
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your hybrids that are here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're having this conversation and
our job is to simply provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for them to meet to make sure
that the agreement will be mutually
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for Bangladeshis in the private
sector and that the government is involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no surprises because there is a
huge investment from the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have a market, why would
they invest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we reduce the risk by having
conversations with the government when we
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that there's an environment that
will be positive for seeing an investment
[SPEAKER_00]: in the private sector into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can have the conversation early
on before the investments are happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also that the companies can directly
talk to the government so they can show
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is an interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government see like, oh,
there is a true interest from local
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to enter the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can hear that the farmers are
interested in hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those conversations take a lot of time
and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can help having those
conversations and bring in like the facts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the science, we can provide an
opportunity to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in Bangladesh have the
infrastructure that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we select these companies
that can actually handle having GMOs or
[SPEAKER_00]: developing their own GMOs?
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot of consultancy in terms of
their research, their infrastructure they
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can provide that kind of knowledge
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the idea is to bring all these
other types of diversity of eggplants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are popular in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some that are already
have been selected by the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the ones that can fit very well in the
market in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the striation, the
different sizes, different shape to fit in
[SPEAKER_00]: that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we learn is that they
really want this shiny coat on the fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if it's matte, may look like it's
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that you may have the best
resistance and the best yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if it's matte versus shiny,
it will not go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, having these conversations and
this is where our you know, so our social
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and engaging with the farmer is
so essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand what the product needs to
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope that these hybrids that already
the conversations have happened between
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies, the licensing agreements
that happened could be available as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as 2026 and 2027 for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These variety, these hybrids carry a
different event, a different gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of they have a different gene that
is not that cry A1C that we've been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go through a whole process of
deregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: While our varieties that BT10 and 11 that
are coming, because they're using the same
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, they can just be approved with
agronomic tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this will take more time and we
will see if it's the government of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh will be ready for going through
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're having conversations with
them to make sure that there is a policy
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that would allow for this
investment to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have learned a lot of lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the ones that I wanted to point
out in the interest of time, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus a little bit more on is the idea of
again, we have to bring wilt resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use wilt resistance as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because when you think about
technology, we're really focused a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time on that technology, that science
that, but remember, we don't eat
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, we eat a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something I have learned during this
process, and this is why I'm so focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: working in this space of science,
of making sure that the science reach the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer field, is because you need to
understand what the product needs to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the consumer is asking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the science begins the moment
that you publish that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like now, how do I make sure that
that becomes a product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that conversation needs to happen
really early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this science going to make it to
the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that product needs to look at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who I have to have in my team that will
support, that will bring that perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I make sure that that science is
successful in farmers field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it could be in this case,
the pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure that we bring
those additional traits into the picture
[SPEAKER_00]: so that, because right now we're only
producing the BGF and in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can bring it to the summer
season, we have a much larger impact in
[SPEAKER_00]: our varieties will be much more adopted by
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the regions that have wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's a huge area of the area
of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, we need to make sure that
again, we have in place that knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: the biotech unit at Bari and with
extension agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can speak about that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they are ready for the challenges
of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, continue to do this insect
resistant management to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: refuge is planted around the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that needed to be introduced but
it needs to be continued to talk about and
[SPEAKER_00]: develop because science move on into the
next best job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to constantly be educating the
scientists, the policy makers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: public in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also realize that the body breeding
program for sustainability purpose needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be strengthened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing is to say, okay, let's
produce two more varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at the entire
pipeline, they may not be varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: can compete well in the system today,
because now there's a lot more private
[SPEAKER_00]: sector investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot better varieties out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body variety is going to be
competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about hybrids,
where does the market is for that open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these conversations need to
happen and strengthen the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs for the technology to be
successful in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pay more attention to
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the nursery investment had
been really opening an eye of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to looking at how the technology can
be adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we thought originally was the
only way that we see, now we realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were missing a whole new area that
again has grown significantly over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that there's a lot of more
opportunities for BTEC plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, only about 10% of the
acreage of eggplant is grown to BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time we talk to farmers and we
introduce them to that technology and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them what the technology can do for them,
they all want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big question I get is what is not
in my preferred variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing about concern about BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not concerned about what they see the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see that reduction in insecticide
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them tell us that they will not
eat eggplant because they know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tell me the same thing about
BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have heard so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have learned so much during the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there's a lot more
opportunities for BT technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, BT is like I said, that's 1982
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about what is going to
replace BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other proteins that we
haven't looked at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other chemicals, natural
chemicals like terpenoids that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful to prevent insecticide use that
we've reduced it, but also that will lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to less insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT was, for example, resistant in the
field, you know, in the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest gaining resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the other
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started working with Greg Martin a
couple of years ago on looking at PTR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're so excited that PTR1 can
provide resistance to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, what is the opportunity
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started evaluating these
technologies of potential use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially we said, oh, maybe the gene is
there and we can just tweak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be something edited and maybe easy
to introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not the case, but we needed to
ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we realized is that eggplant
has all the elements necessary for PTR1 to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just go back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has all the elements, the components
needed for PTR1 response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like, can we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we introduce PTR1 as a second gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be a dual purpose transgenic
that not only provide resistance to the
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant fruit and shoot borer,
but that can provide immunity for wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that required that Adam came into the
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Adam came into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need to understand the
population of the pathogen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors to understand if PTR1 was going
to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is silent on the yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have technology that is here
at Cornell and at BTI that we could use
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue this next generation of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this, we have so many technologies
that can be so useful in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: countries for the benefit of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like the role that I see for
Cornell and all the other advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: research universities and institutes is
the work that we do has a place in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can do really, really good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we hope is that over the next
years, we can continue to bring technology
[SPEAKER_00]: like this to the field, because it's where
it belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't belong just in a journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for listening today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so that was a very interesting
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take some questions here and
online as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say a little bit more about the
resistance to PT and mechanism of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but you put me in this, but I feel
again like I'm a grad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a non-entomologist, I can tell you
that the resistance to BT is recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it means is that for the
resistance to evolve, it will take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the pest can continue to reproduce
in non-BT, we are not putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: selection pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to delay the process of
selection by not putting pressure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having this refuge, the insect can
continue to reproduce and continue to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a minimum in a heterozygous if it
develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't go to homozygous,
because it encounters more non-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's similar to when we release,
I will bring it to plant pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that you stack your
resistant genes so that you put less
[SPEAKER_00]: selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting selection pressure against
multiple pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea by putting two or more BT
genes, we are going to reduce again the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of that mutation to become,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be fixed in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maintaining minimums of heterozygous,
hopefully we don't get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have multiple BT genes to
stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the goal, that we will
release stacks or at least varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: have different BT genes to reduce the
selection pressure in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survive.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about how we reduce,
you know, in 2021, there was a reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of let's say adoption, but it was really
because accessibility to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, and so the question is,
what are we doing to support like the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production and get back into what we
needed to be producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot have to do with communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the dealers were saying,
oh, we are not getting a pull from the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that with our limited
resources, we needed to focus on other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and stop producing BT eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had the conversation that did
you go to the particular district where
[SPEAKER_00]: this BT is needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, because if you look at the entire
country, it may be that you don't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that is necessary because it has not
been introduced across the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been selected a particular district
that have the market class and that also
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have the wilt or that can grow it
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, you know, that communication
wasn't happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they had to select where to put
the resources for good reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: they went into a different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now do we have a much better
understanding of what the farmers need in
[SPEAKER_00]: which locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we communicate that early on in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of our season, say,
okay, these were the farmers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing BT eggplant this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need seed for these many farmers in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lot of having that
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
I was curious, is the cry one gene carried
in the pollen and really the follow up on
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are some of these refuge plants,
are the seeds from them containing that
[SPEAKER_02]: event?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about if the cry one
seed gene is present in the pollen and if
[SPEAKER_00]: the refuge that is around the field will
have, then we can incorporate that gene
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a chance that cry one seed
will go into that neighboring eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot remember exactly what is the
distance, but it's not a long distance
[SPEAKER_00]: where the pollen is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have checked that there's studies
being done on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers that grow the eggplant in the
borders, if they were to save seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, this will be just one copy of that
in that particular event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are very much concerned with
that movement of that pollen when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, and that's what we have been very
aware in this case that if the gene were
[SPEAKER_00]: to move, the only thing we will do it will
make it resistant to the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's by not something that we want it
to happen because they have the idea is
[SPEAKER_00]: that these varieties of eggplant continue
to be as indigenous as they always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst case scenarios that will be
resistant to the pests and will survive
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has like a 10% cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like, yeah, between 10 and 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that, Ronnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop share so it's easier for me to
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Greg is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What steps do you recommend for a
scientist that just discovered a new
[SPEAKER_00]: control strategy to deploy it as fast as
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Michael, for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it is important that we
understand how is this technology useful
[SPEAKER_00]: and communicate that early on not only to
your colleagues, collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you have a pretty diverse
group of people in your network so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can move that technology, work with
your breeders, work with your pathologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: work your entomologies with agronomists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you understand the system
where you want to deliver this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of times we tend to be a
little bit secretive because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that, oh, somebody can scoop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't talk about it,
you may be missing an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization of this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is important that we
communicate early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to get a group of
sponsors for our research that understand
[SPEAKER_00]: where science fits in the field and
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our job to communicate that to them,
to policymakers, to donors, to sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where do we see this going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it's going to happen
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be 10, 20 years down the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have a clear understanding of
where the science can go and can
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate that effectively, I think we
can go a lot farther than we have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times it starts with,
it's not really an aha moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, hmm, that's a funny moment in
the lab, something that doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moment that something doesn't fit
and you think you have something really
[SPEAKER_00]: good, you start thinking, what are the
implications of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can it be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, a lot of times we don't tend to
think that big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get so focused, especially in grad
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so focused on that particular
example, that pathway, that gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we forget that it belongs in a
much larger environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to people that specialize in
photosynthesis at MSU this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were talking about, what is that
technology that you're thinking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you guys work on photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working on Robisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working on Robisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the protein that has been studied so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still do not understand it,
of all the benefit and how we can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that, we have so many systems that
we do not understand, because we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: asked the big picture, how does it fit
with the rest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we just need to do more
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect note to end on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thank you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
