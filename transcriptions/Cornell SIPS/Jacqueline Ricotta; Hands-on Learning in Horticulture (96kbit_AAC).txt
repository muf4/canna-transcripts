[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we'll be talking about hands-on
learning in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, and Steve did point this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in Penn, even though our name is
Delaware Valley, we are in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a big star up here for, of course,
this is Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are down here in Doylestown.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly enough, we are just
about as far from Cornell as we are from
[SPEAKER_03]: Penn State.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be coming north rather
than west from now on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't talk about hands-on learning
and teaching in horticulture without
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing some of the work from Liberty
Hyde Bailey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, since I've been here,
I've spent a lot of time reading about
[SPEAKER_03]: Liberty Hyde Bailey, looking at all his
portraits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was particularly
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote a book back in 1910 called The
Training of Farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I regard certain kinds of
demonstration work on farms as of the
[SPEAKER_03]: greatest teaching value if it is conducted
by a good teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this quote really struck home with me
because we definitely use our teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: farms at DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use the farms in the region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really important to the faculty
at DelVal to be good teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, for the most part, do very little
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to publish papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of us do not have big research
programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to unless we want to apply
for grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do is teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll talk about that through the
seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really important also to know a
little bit about the history of DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually founded in 1896 as the
National Farm School.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually on one of the
original buildings that is now still on
[SPEAKER_03]: our campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's really interesting is how this
all came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe it or not, there's actually
connections to Cornell in the history of
[SPEAKER_03]: DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully everybody recognizes Andrew
Dixon White here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In about 1887, Joseph Krauskopf was the
rabbi.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the leader of a large Jewish
synagogue in Philadelphia called Knethez,
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Krauskopf was really known as a social
reformer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very forward thinking on the role
of women on the need for social programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he addressed these issues in his
writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was, again, very well known at that
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1894, he actually wrote to Andrew Dixon
White, who was the ambassador to Russia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was because of Andrew Dixon White
putting him in touch with Count Leo
[SPEAKER_03]: Tolstoy that Rabbi Krauskopf met with Leo
Tolstoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tolstoy actually told him,
return to America and leave the tens of
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands from your congested cities to
your idle, fertile lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Krauskopf spoke to Tolstoy about was
his worries, his concerns for many of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Jewish immigrants coming to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was especially worried about the Jewish
youth coming over and not having jobs and
[SPEAKER_03]: the anti-Semitism that they were beginning
to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this was a seminal moment in the
genesis of DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Krauskopf actually wrote about it in
my visit to Tolstoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, the friendship,
and this is just an aside, the friendship
[SPEAKER_03]: between Andrew Dixon White and Joseph
Krauskopf continued.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1906, White actually came to
Philadelphia and he gave the keynote
[SPEAKER_03]: speech at a dedication of a stained glass
window that was being installed in Knesset
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a photograph of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The window was dedicated to the Secretary
of State, John Hayes, who apparently
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew Dixon White knew very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in one of the publications I was
reading, he gave a wonderful speech about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this friendship between Krauskopf
and Andrew Dixon White continued for many
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually, while being on sabbatical
here at Cornell, have spent some time in
[SPEAKER_03]: the archives down in Olin Library,
which is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are some of the letters that
I've found.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from these two centers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a set of correspondences.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Joseph Krauskopf,
and this is actually from Andrew Dixon
[SPEAKER_03]: White.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multiple page letter back to
Krauskopf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to read, it's hard for you to
see right here, but you could tell that
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an affection between the two
men.
[SPEAKER_03]: Krauskopf says in his letter, with kindest
regards to your dear wife and daughter,
[SPEAKER_03]: whom I may have the pleasure of meeting at
our temple, in all of which Mrs. Krauskopf
[SPEAKER_03]: heartily joins me, I remain with
sentiments of esteem, very sincerely
[SPEAKER_03]: yours, Joseph Krauskopf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was this connection between
Delvail and Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get back to teaching and
learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Krauskopf got back from Russia,
what he did was he what he learned from
[SPEAKER_03]: Tolstoy was that there should be science
with practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Krauskopf came back and he bought
hundreds of acres of land in Bucks County,
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see an aerial photograph of
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this is what kind of a more
modern schematic of what campus looks like
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the hundred or so acres that
Krauskopf started with, he bought more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the years, Delvail has been
gifted with farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have a wealth of acreage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three separate farms and over a
thousand acres of farmland, which and
[SPEAKER_03]: forest land, which we have orchards and we
have vegetable crops and animals and
[SPEAKER_03]: pastures and everything that an ag school
might have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the National Farm School changed
through the years in 1948, it became the
[SPEAKER_03]: National Agricultural College in 1960,
it actually became Delaware Valley College
[SPEAKER_03]: of Science and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere along the way, they dropped the
science and agriculture and we were just
[SPEAKER_03]: for many years Delaware Valley College.
[SPEAKER_03]: We added buildings and again, as I said,
we added farms and it was in 2014 that the
[SPEAKER_03]: college became a university.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we are today is about 1,700
undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 300 graduate students,
but all of our graduate programs are in
[SPEAKER_03]: business and education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now have a couple of smaller
programs in criminal justice and policy
[SPEAKER_03]: studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually do not have graduate programs
in any of the sciences, but there are
[SPEAKER_03]: about 25 majors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once Delvail became a university,
we broke up into three separate colleges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ag and environmental sciences,
business and humanities and life and
[SPEAKER_03]: physical sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I am part of the ag and
environmental science college at Delvail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have about 90 total faculty,
which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I understand it, there's about 90
total faculty here in SIPs at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just been really wonderful to know
that I'm surrounded by so many people who
[SPEAKER_03]: love plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the science with practice, that
historical way that Krauskopf founded the
[SPEAKER_03]: National Farm School has stayed with us
through all of these years and all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Historically, so when I began in 2000,
students had the requirement of working
[SPEAKER_03]: 900 hours in their field before they could
graduate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so over the years, that's changed
slightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now have what is called the E360
program or the Experience 360 program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 100% of our students graduate with
experience in the field that they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: go into.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you cannot major in something without
having worked in that field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And along with the actual work experience,
we have classes that go along with E360
[SPEAKER_03]: that require that the students actually
reflect on their work experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just doing a job, it's
reflecting on, wow, did I like this job?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is my personality suited to this job?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something I think I can do
long-term?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really developed into an entire
program and the experiences that the
[SPEAKER_03]: student received through the C360 program
actually go on their transcripts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that they can present to
an employer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the work experience that DelVal
students are required to have can be done
[SPEAKER_03]: on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is one of the things I've
noted that might be a little different
[SPEAKER_03]: than here is we have a few farm managers,
but by and large the work on the farm is
[SPEAKER_03]: done by student employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are actually students who are
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have orchards, we have a apple sorting
equipment, we have a cider press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the students are the ones who are
working on the farms, providing much of
[SPEAKER_03]: the labor that's needed to keep all this
acreage going.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the plant sciences at DelVal,
we are actually split up into two
[SPEAKER_03]: different departments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly to what has happened here,
there's been this change in, are we one
[SPEAKER_03]: department, are we two, are we three?
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the department of plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have around 105 students and we have
majors in all of these areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a horticulture major,
a sustainable ag me, a turf major,
[SPEAKER_03]: crop science, and then our organic farming
certificate, which I'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_03]: few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Landscape architecture and environmental
sciences is just a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can major in environmental
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually do a landscape
architecture degree, which we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: DelVal alum who is here now getting her
MLA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our program is an accredited landscape
architecture program, which really has
[SPEAKER_03]: been a benefit since the student who's
here now was able to cut a semester out of
[SPEAKER_03]: her program because of coming through this
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lots of different facilities on
campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that's really popular,
and this is actually part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture major, is we have both
hydroponics and aquaponics on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were able to retrofit some of our
greenhouses because of an extremely large,
[SPEAKER_03]: for us, donation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this now is somewhere that students
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a class around this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the lettuce that is produced
shows up in our cafeteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have, as I mentioned, lots of
trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: The campus itself is considered to be the
Henry Schmider Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so almost all of our trees and our
shrubs are labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what everything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our arbor culture class, students are
actually taught.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a class.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an actual student.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taught to climb trees,
which is something that someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: going out into the world to be an arbor
culturalist might need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then generally in our LAES department,
what we are involved in is the
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia Flower Show, which is every
March.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the largest flower shows in
the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's an actual class that students
take in the fall semester where they
[SPEAKER_03]: design the display for the flower show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the spring semester,
they actually build as much as they can on
[SPEAKER_03]: campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then are responsible for taking it
down to Philly, to the convention center,
[SPEAKER_03]: and assembling and painting and doing
everything that the display needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Advising is also really important at
DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the three things that we have in
place is, it's called a hold on the
[SPEAKER_03]: student accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: A student cannot register for classes
unless they've seen their advisor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that means is that once the
advisor has met with the student,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we go into a system online and
release the hold and the student is able
[SPEAKER_03]: to register.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that important for us to have this
one-on-one contact with the student every
[SPEAKER_03]: single semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I advise, and it varies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We added two new faculty a couple years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been as many as 30, but now it hovers
around probably 12 to 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets really busy during advising
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we are a unionized teaching
institution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that means is we are actually
contractually obligated to teach 12
[SPEAKER_03]: contact hours each semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually, this is what I'm
heading back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why it was so great to be on
sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is a lecture and lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a lecture, a lecture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a lecture and a lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just teach the lecture portion and this
is just more of a, almost like a
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion section.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it'd be kind of interesting to
show everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what, so we actually are obligated
to, in fact, this was really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came here, I'm like, where's
everyone's schedule?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, they're all on their door.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to put this on our door.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so that everybody knows not only
where we are, but where we can be found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, advising is such a critical
piece of this hands-on, this close
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship we have with students.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I wanted to, the other
thing I wanted to point out was that we
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule in a way that helps us do this
hands-on learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, commercial vegetable
production has a lecture on Monday,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also has a lecture and a lab on
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a good four hours with the
students in order to take them on trips
[SPEAKER_03]: and do longer types of projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: IPM is, there is no lab, but the lectures
are scheduled back to back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, in this case, we have like about a
three hour timeframe that allows us to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and last thing is we are also,
again, contractually obligated to have six
[SPEAKER_03]: office hours per week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are times that we have to be
in our office and available to students.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so finally, to the really fun
and interesting part, what I actually get
[SPEAKER_03]: to do when I teach horticulture at DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the marketing of horticulture
products class.
[SPEAKER_03]: This class, once again, is really is
required of horticulture major.
[SPEAKER_03]: So horticulture majors, because a lot of
our students are going back to family
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses, or they're going to have their
own farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in this case, we take about four to
five field trips each semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: The students are creating new businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this regard, it's a horticultural
business, they have to actually have
[SPEAKER_03]: business cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: They create brochures.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an online newsletter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They write press releases.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, the students are actually
creating real businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty exciting when they actually
have something that they're going to use
[SPEAKER_03]: later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of the semester is what we call
Shark Tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually doing presentations
as if they were in Shark Tank,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that they can get experience looking
for business loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our field trips are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little dark here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is actually the Philadelphia
Regional Wholesale Produce Market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an amazing state of the art place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the largest refrigerated terminal
market in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have not been there,
I would highly recommend a trip there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not break the cold chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very different than Hunts Point
Market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also visit farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, this is an entertainment
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the bouncing pillows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like an open moon bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the farmers are insistent that if the
students try that, so they get a chance
[SPEAKER_03]: once again to really get a feel for what
it's like to have an entertainment farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: In organic food and fiber, which is a fall
class, we take field trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, probably about four every semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is to the Rodale Institute,
which, as you'll see, is our partner in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Organic Farming Certificate Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about an hour from DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We visit various organic farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a particular farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an organic grocery store that's
about 20 minutes from campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the neatest things that we do
is the students are actually involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: the organic certification inspection that
takes place on one of our farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: For many years, I was responsible for
maintaining the certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I will do is I'll haul all my
organic system plan and documentation to
[SPEAKER_03]: class.
[SPEAKER_03]: The students actually get to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is our inspector.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go through the inspection on the farm,
and then they actually sit through the
[SPEAKER_03]: exit interview, which is part of every
organic inspection.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a really wonderful exercise
because of having so many students who
[SPEAKER_03]: want to have organic farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So often, there is this curtain behind
what it means to be certified organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this exercise really opens the curtain
and shows everyone that it's not a process
[SPEAKER_03]: that is terrible to go through by any
means.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we do, again,
because organic food and fiber has to deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with animals as well, we get in some guest
lectures.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a cow signals workshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we actually are down at the dairy
farm on campus, which you can just walk
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the organic veterinarian is leading.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a student.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's leading the students through an
exercise looking at cow signals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a way to keep cattle healthy when
you are an organic producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Commercial vegetable production,
which I've really enjoyed sitting in on
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve's class.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lab attached to ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the biggest things we do is
what's called the farmer's apprentice
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one of our greenhouses on campus,
we have 12 raised beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each raised bed is 40 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the student and their partner raise
vegetables all semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the beds start out empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the beginnings of the
plantings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have lights in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this helps in January and February when
there's really not enough outdoor light.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see that it becomes a jungle
in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And students really take ownership of
producing their crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love that they are able to harvest
and take everything home and eat what
[SPEAKER_03]: they've actually produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, but they're doing scouting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing pest control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the most important things that
they do in this project is record keeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: As anyone knows today, whether you're
organic or whether you're a conventional
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer, because of food safety concerns
and traceability, every farmer needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: have good records.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this really trains them in record
keeping absolutely everything they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, from what varieties they've chosen
to plant to what types of pests or what
[SPEAKER_03]: types of pest control measures they've
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that students really
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're ever feeling gloomy on a
March day, you just find people wandering
[SPEAKER_03]: in here because it just becomes this
wonderful jungle of vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do take field trips in our commercial
veg class.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an alumni's farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: DelVal is actually across the street from
Burpee's Ford Hook Farm, which is a really
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful place to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've gone to Ford Hook Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is J.R.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fertilizer company about an hour
from DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Kerry Peters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Crystal Snyder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystal's an alumni.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she hosts us at this amazing
fertilizer facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the students actually get to see
fertilizer being blended and bagged and
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the testing that they do with that
facility as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes, farms will, they will have
exercises for the student or tasks for the
[SPEAKER_03]: students to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done everything from planting to
digging holes for irrigation, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a little over an hour from Her's
potato chip factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will sometimes take field trips to
Her's where we meet with Jean Her,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the owners and operators who does
all the potato buying for the chipping
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes on at Her's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tour is just really fun because,
of course, they pull the fresh potato
[SPEAKER_03]: chips off the conveyor belt for everyone
to taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lest you're wondering why I have
a Chocolate World photo here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is because one of the field trips
that's so important to us in commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetable production is the going to the
Mid-Atlantic Fruit and Vegetable Growers
[SPEAKER_03]: Convention in Hershey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania Vegetable Growers has been
gracious enough to let our students in for
[SPEAKER_03]: free.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been going on for as long as I,
as long as I've been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we go on our class day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take a bus and DelVal used to have
their own buses, but we now rent through a
[SPEAKER_03]: service.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we go to Hershey for the day and
students are able to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're able to experience what a grower
meeting is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every now and then if we have
extra time, we stop at Chocolate World.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do labs on campus similar to what Steve
has done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get students out on equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get them planting, laying plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're planting potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we are able to take advantage of
what's happening on our farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in years past, students have actually
helped build a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm usually in pretty close contact
with our farm managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if something's going on and it fits
into our schedule and their schedule,
[SPEAKER_03]: we try to jump into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of our high tunnels that we
actually plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the students are able to actually set
up the trickle irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they get that kind of hands-on way to
do the plumbing and with the headers and
[SPEAKER_03]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also teach a lab on grafting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the students are taught three
different ways to graft tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they do the grafting exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we monitor the progress on
whether the graft has been successful or
[SPEAKER_03]: not throughout the remainder of the
semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: IPM, I wanted to include a class that
doesn't have a lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you recall, this is scheduled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a long course period.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take a couple of field trips that are
really valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember Lloyd and Alex Traven
from Peachtree Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are Cornell alums.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a certified organic greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they use all beneficial insects and
IPM practices in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the most eye-opening
field trips for the students.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they see that you can have this
immaculate greenhouse full of many
[SPEAKER_03]: different species of plants and have very,
very low pest pressure through the use of
[SPEAKER_03]: biological controls.
[SPEAKER_03]: The New Jersey Beneficial Insect Lab is an
amazing place.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's probably next to Steve is
the best thing about New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is part of New Jersey's Department of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually raise beneficial insects
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not labs like this around the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is only one of a handful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we take students there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're very welcoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show us the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show us how they raise their
beneficial insects and some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: projects that they've been involved in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Students also do what's called an IPM
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very lengthy project broken up into
pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, they're able to choose a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they come out with a set of
information that they take with them when
[SPEAKER_03]: they're working in a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse, when they're working on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the IPM toolbox, as big of a
project as it is, I always get very
[SPEAKER_03]: positive comments that students have
enjoyed doing this and taking this deep
[SPEAKER_03]: dive into what IPM really means for their
specific crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be remiss if I didn't actually
talk about assessment and student
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent a lot of time here at Cornell
looking over your Center for Teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovation website.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we are, I think we're
doing what we're supposed to be doing at
[SPEAKER_03]: DelVal, which was really a nice thing to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a lot of time for
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I do is that
there's actually questions about the field
[SPEAKER_03]: trip on the exams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these field trips don't just exist
because they're enjoyable to get off
[SPEAKER_03]: campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tested on what they learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Students are encouraged to take notes,
to take pictures, and to integrate what
[SPEAKER_03]: they've learned on the farm into any
project that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The E360 program, again, students are
employed, they're working, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: encouraged to provide feedback on whether
learning has taken place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I believe that we're doing what
we should be doing as far as all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching and learning research that's been
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, I just have a few more slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our most hands-on programs,
not a class, but a program, is our Organic
[SPEAKER_03]: Farming Certificate Program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are partnered with the Rodale
Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've actually been supported by two
USDA Beginning Farmer and Rancher
[SPEAKER_03]: Development grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in my career, I'm finally
getting grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has been a whole learning experience
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 75% veterans in this
program, but they're integrated right into
[SPEAKER_03]: our regular classes, which has been a real
challenge from a teaching and learning
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're spending the summer session,
though, at Rodale, where they have two
[SPEAKER_03]: other academic classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Farm Practicum is essentially
our version of this ethos.
[SPEAKER_03]: The E360, they're actually working on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a class period where
everyone reflects on the work they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing and shares what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody kind of gets to learn from
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an awesome hands-on thing that I'm
able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Global Field Studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I do teach a course every other
year in gardens, food, and farms in
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuscany.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really can't learn about Italian food
without going to Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we take, or I should say I take
students, and we go to this amazing farm
[SPEAKER_03]: called Spinnacchia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would truly, if anyone here wants to
take students, I would highly recommend
[SPEAKER_03]: this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are set up with places, like almost
like dorms for students to live in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They produce all the food that they serve.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have classes right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that, again,
hands-on learning, not only about
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture, but about the culture of
Italy and the way they approach food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a lot of fun as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, our clubs and our
organizations also reflect the hands-on
[SPEAKER_03]: philosophy of DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the advisor of Hort Society,
which is our horticulture club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we take field trips to,
of course, see mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia is the mushroom capital of
the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not far from a cranberry farm,
which I was saying to someone this
[SPEAKER_03]: morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm inviting you all to come out next
fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer actually has a whole set of hip
waiters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody puts on hip waiters and
goes into the cranberry bog, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also take groups of students
to another conference, the Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_03]: Association for Sustainable Agriculture,
which has been historically held at Penn
[SPEAKER_03]: State, but now it's going to be in
Lancaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's even closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my time is just about up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to once again thank
everyone here at Cornell for being so
[SPEAKER_03]: welcoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had such a wonderful sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came across this poem from Liberty High
Bailey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like it was really important
for me to finish with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to read this because it's
about the way that Liberty High Bailey
[SPEAKER_03]: thought we should be teaching,
the way I believe in teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there certainly will come a day as men
become simple and wise, when schools will
[SPEAKER_03]: put their books away till they train the
hands and eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the school from its heart will say,
in love of the wind and the skies,
[SPEAKER_03]: I teach the earth and the soil to them
that toil, the hill and fen, to common men
[SPEAKER_03]: that live just here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was, when do I schedule
the longer field trip?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Italy trip, because it's
horticultural in nature, I go in
[SPEAKER_03]: September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always schedule it over the Labor
Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I schedule it over the Labor Day
weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the students are missing a little
bit less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, because it's so early in the
semester, we actually start about a week
[SPEAKER_03]: later than Cornell starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're usually in about the second week of
the semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: So students aren't really, they're missing
classes, but they can catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do other faculty get upset because
students are missing classes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would honestly tell you that we are so,
everyone does lots of trips and field
[SPEAKER_03]: trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that is part of the DelVal
culture that everyone just is accepting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a very active FFA group,
and they usually go for a whole week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just help the student catch up and
provide as much support material as you
[SPEAKER_03]: can through Blackboard and everything else
so that the student, as I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: is missing as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you teach such a diversity of classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, I'll bet somewhere along
the line you took some risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder about what's maybe a big risk
that you took in teaching, and what were
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefits and the challenges of doing
so?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Marcia asked when I took a risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the biggest risk I felt was
teaching IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I had a very, coming out of
graduate school, I had a very strong
[SPEAKER_03]: background in weed science, but not so
much in entomology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the background that everyone
typically has.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like IPM is the class that I've
developed the most and am very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very successful at teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yes, I think I took some risks
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also then I was very early on,
I also started promoting the whole idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial insects and using
bioprocessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think everyone now can say,
wow, there's so much going on in that
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I would say, yes,
taking a risk of teaching is that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackie, first, thank you so much for your
seminar and for sharing L.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey's poem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That poem was very reflective of his
engagement with the nature studies
[SPEAKER_01]: movement, which also featured people like
Anna Bobsford Comstock and Louis Nagazis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, can you talk a bit about
the demographics of your students,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they come from, what their
backgrounds are like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: The demographics of our students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a good, that's an excellent
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of our students are from
Pennsylvania and New Jersey and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: mid-Atlantic region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of our students are still first
generation college students and they are
[SPEAKER_03]: by and large from rural backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So their high school preparation for
college is certainly not as strong as you
[SPEAKER_03]: would find in a Cornell student.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also our average SATs, although in
horticulture is fairly high in general for
[SPEAKER_03]: DelVal as a whole, is significantly lower
than the typical Cornell student.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while not everyone is from a farm,
they're generally from a rural community
[SPEAKER_03]: in the mid-Atlantic region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they want to go back to that
community and have some sort of career in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also I should make note, we do not send
very many students to graduate school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say 5% of our graduates go on to
graduate school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 10%, but really very, very few.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are people who are going into the
agricultural industry, working in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a really good job placing students
at Longwood Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And DelVal students are known,
I think historically, for being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: hit the ground running when they start
their employment because they've had such
[SPEAKER_03]: a hands-on type of training on so much job
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hannah?
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost all of our, almost all of our,
Hannah's question was what are summers
[SPEAKER_03]: like at DelVal for faculty?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be lying if I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for students, some students will stay
and work on the farm at DelVal this past
[SPEAKER_03]: summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually had something new since we're
so close to Burpee's Ford Hook Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, they wanted to give their
ground a rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of their trial gardens moved over
to DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a number of interns working on
the trial gardens this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also just a group who works with
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have what's called a hope for the
harvest garden, a charitable garden where
[SPEAKER_03]: we just produce for, to give away to fill
abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a local food charity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most students will go back to where
they're from and find some sort of,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're generally from an
agricultural region, they'll find some
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of job that will count towards their
E360 credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, do students go through
the tree climbing certification program?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly if they do,
but we tend to have a lot of in that
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't teach that class.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we tend to have a lot of add-ons in
our class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a course where that you can
take that you get your pesticide
[SPEAKER_03]: applicator's license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the past, and I haven't done
this recently because, but in the past,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of my classes have actually counted
towards the credits that you need to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: renewing your pesticide applicator's
license.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do try to have add-ons like that as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there things you saw here that you
say, oh, I can't wait to take back and try
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious about you.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, again, a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there things I've seen here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there absolutely are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been so very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the plant anatomy class, Alejandro
Nixon flips the classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to integrate that into the
botany lab, which I've been working on
[SPEAKER_03]: revising a botany lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Botany lab manual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, in his vegetable production,
does the problem solving, which I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: excellent because it really gives the
students an opportunity to actually talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to the class about questions and what type
of what they're seeing in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Marvin, I love the idea of the
ePortfolio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love to bring something like that
back to DelVal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a teacher, how much economy do you have
when we're creating and designing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: classes versus you get this group of
students that have probably specific
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for what they need to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the balance there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, how much leeway do you
have to developing new and innovative
[SPEAKER_03]: class?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of leeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's something that you want to
teach, then you are encouraged to develop
[SPEAKER_03]: a new course around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, we have someone who just
was hired about two years ago from
[SPEAKER_03]: University of California at Davis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's developed a new crop evolution
class.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have someone else who is interested in
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just developed that new class.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else, her global field studies
classes, she took students to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last spring break.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she developed not only the Hawaii trip,
but a lecture class around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's because we're not doing
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really encouraged to do that type of
scholarship for our promotion and tenure
[SPEAKER_03]: packages, our portfolios.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the scholarship of teaching that is
really what has to come through loud and
[SPEAKER_03]: clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So developing new classes is part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also a set of one credit
honors colloquia that are usually
[SPEAKER_03]: available to teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to try something out,
just one lecture a week, you can do but
[SPEAKER_03]: take that path as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
