[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so my name is Paul Ceylon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking at these plants for 30
years, looking at cover crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: and interestingly enough, doing
interseeding research since 1987.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I have a little caveat here that
I'll get into as far as this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's based on the utilization
of mixes based in the 5B zone,
[SPEAKER_03]: where my experience is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have, within the calculator,
although it's not connected, we do have
[SPEAKER_03]: information that shows what the earliest
plant we take the different species are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing mixes, typically you
are using legumes and brasses in
[SPEAKER_03]: connection with grass and grains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my region, pretty much the cutoff
period is September 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're dealing with silage corn or
grain corn, you're not dealing with mixes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my outline is why adaptive management
to evaluate multi-species mixes,
[SPEAKER_03]: why the calculator was developed,
rationale for seeding rates and dates,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to use the calculator and how to
modify the calculator.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the information has to deal with
growing three days as a precursor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll try to go through that pretty
quickly because it takes a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But adaptive management basically is
testing your assumptions about
[SPEAKER_03]: systematically trying different actions,
different cover crop ratios and mixes to
[SPEAKER_03]: achieve the desired outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, however, not a random trial and
error process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And adaption is about taking action to
improve your project based on the results
[SPEAKER_03]: of your evaluations and monitoring and
then learning about systematically
[SPEAKER_03]: documenting your team process and the
results you achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I put that in there is,
and this is somewhat of a comical really,
[SPEAKER_03]: more than anything, but if you take five
species and you have four different rates
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have four reps in three locations,
that would be 12,280 plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, nobody is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by using adaptive management,
what people do as they do their research
[SPEAKER_03]: over time or a literature review,
you rapidly reduce that number.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you only have three seeding rates
at five species, four reps, one location
[SPEAKER_03]: in two years, that's 1,944 plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't count different seeding dates
or possibly different nitrogen ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the adaptive management
part comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And possibly with the Northeast Cover Crop
Council going out there and utilizing the
[SPEAKER_03]: calculator and fine tuning it and doing
expert opinion later to show how to get
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these competitions back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why I developed the
calculator is that, again, we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing small plots and then we will
hopefully see some of this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And combining the different species on
different planting dates, I needed
[SPEAKER_03]: something to sort of systematically figure
out what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this calculator started off as a
simple spreadsheet and then a 20-something
[SPEAKER_03]: person who I gave a training to turned it
into a calculator in about three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been working on it and improving
it somewhat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it will go to the Northeast Cover
Crop Council, hopefully bringing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: growing to three-day type stuff to further
fine tune it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been doing small plot work as
well as larger fields and drilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have your species composition
and density to a place so that all species
[SPEAKER_03]: can grow to a point that will allow them
to achieve their intended purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we see quite frequently in earlier
research and things have been moving
[SPEAKER_03]: forward is that we see situations where
there's probably too much of the grasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing clover, right clover
here, not really producing the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass and its function of nitrogen that
it's needed as well as the soybean because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just too much grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I'm sure most of the earlier
research in 2011 has kind of moved past
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was seeing that in my initial work
and realizing that something needed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned immediately earlier,
the typical summer annual grain system
[SPEAKER_03]: does not really allow itself to
multi-species nexus, typically just maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: hairy vetch and grains, maybe annual
ryegrass, not counting the home and
[SPEAKER_03]: proceeding situation, which others will
talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would lead itself to following
winter grains or vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use Clima too out of Cornell,
which is probably what was driving the
[SPEAKER_03]: other program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on research at Cornell and other
places, we're looking at phase 40,
[SPEAKER_03]: the latest period to grow grasses or to
grow legumes and brassica is around the
[SPEAKER_03]: first week in September or earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking across the Chesapeake Bay,
this is showing essentially the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: September 1st growing degree days 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the lower zone, which includes the
flats as well as Penn State.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking at about a total of 1,000
to 1,200 growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're down in Maryland,
obviously the later dates for the
[SPEAKER_03]: brassicas and legumes are going to be
moving maybe closer to October 1st,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can get that 1,000 growing
degree days for those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas October 1st is pretty much too
late to get significant growth and be
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive with the grasses that you're
growing at the same time, which I will
[SPEAKER_03]: show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it's been worked on and we've done
some, which is growth response at
[SPEAKER_03]: different temperatures and looking at all
these different species that people are
[SPEAKER_03]: using in combined ability with grasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And typically there seems to be an
inflection point around 400 growing degree
[SPEAKER_03]: days and starting to get some decent
biomass at 600 growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, continuing up until we can kind
of continue on with more growing degree
[SPEAKER_03]: days, which is probably done in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end of this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania, you can have three to four
times as much biomass of oats and wheat
[SPEAKER_03]: and rye if you plant one month earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this is important because if
you're trying to grow your legumes and
[SPEAKER_03]: your brassicas and you're restricted to
planting at September 1st or earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: that means you are going to be planting
your cereal grain and your brassicas at a
[SPEAKER_03]: time when it's going to produce an
enormous amount of biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to reduce that seeding rate
way much lower than what had been the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional kind of full rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people kind of get this now,
but it's all been a learning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at Big Flats, we've done some trials
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is looking at cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going from left to right is a late
planting date to early planting date and
[SPEAKER_03]: three different cutting intervals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you can see is that if you're
planting two weeks earlier, you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: like a 50% more increase in your cereal
rye biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, about a 30% gain if you
wait a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So approximately if you have a 40%
increase in biomass by planting two weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier, which you can make things more
competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can make up some of your biomass
by delaying one week to make up for a two
[SPEAKER_03]: week delay in planting day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you have planting date of
September 17th to 1200 pounds per acre
compared to September 4th.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by waiting a week, you are getting
actually a little bit more biomass by
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So visually what it looks like is looking
at 25 pounds per acre of rye at three
[SPEAKER_03]: different planting dates and 100 pounds of
rye at three different planting dates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that 100 pounds per acre,
you're not going to have really any room
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow any other species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just going to get out competed
for 25 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even that is pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what we've kind of used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the planting rate actually is more
important than the planting date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one was only a month and a half
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was actually November 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's probably a little bit more
biomass then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these two were like December.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at from a biomass standpoint,
the 25 pounds per acre is producing a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant amount of biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: The earlier you plant, the less of a
difference the later you plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more of a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we're looking at September
15th, that's the latest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even earlier, probably the 25 pounds
per acre is going to be more than
[SPEAKER_03]: adequate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conversely, in the spring, you've got the
growing degree days rapidly increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see here, historically,
rye begins to fall at around the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: of May, but you're not really putting on
your biomass on your legumes until two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three weeks later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a real issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we've learned is
not to use false statured cereal rye in
[SPEAKER_03]: combination with your clovers and
brassica.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to use something like triticale
or barley to use oats that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerate winter killing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what it looks like as far as
biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, this is May 11th, and you're
having two and a half tons of biomass from
[SPEAKER_03]: your cereal rye, but only one ton of
biomass from your legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you would probably want your legumes
to grow another week or two, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: probably won't if they're overshadowed by
the cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to be able to number one,
if you're using these mixes and you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be growing the mixes for nitrogen
production, you need to have your system
[SPEAKER_03]: and your management system be such that
will allow you to delay your planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you're not really going to get
the value from your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last slide related to this would
be the warm and cool season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found in big flats that you can get
a lot of biomass from your warm seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere even August 1st, August 15th
this year was a really slightly weirder
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see a big flat, so we didn't get
quite as much biomass as we normally had
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then August 1st, you probably want a
mix that's totally warm season,
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you're going to graze it or flip it
to allow the cool seasons to emerge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after August 15th, you probably
should be looking at cool seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the cover crop, how much time we
have?
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'll just for organization,
this is what the calculator looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so first of all, there's a couple of
entry points, the seeding method and
[SPEAKER_03]: different purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the seeding method, we have a drop down
box here, and we have either a fixed rate
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can have, or you can manipulate
the cover crop to give you choices of
[SPEAKER_03]: those percentage changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just what it would look like behind
the scenes is essentially your drop down
[SPEAKER_03]: box first would have some monocultures and
you have early and late, drill or till.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're early, we reduce the
monoculture rate by 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's late, this zero means the
calculator was trying to get no change to
[SPEAKER_03]: the monoculture rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, we've been learning and
listening to farmers and we're going,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is part of NRCS New York Specs point
is that if they are doing this for soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health and there's no other resource
concern, or if they're planting,
[SPEAKER_03]: no till or planting green, we have a
pretty large reduction in the monoculture
[SPEAKER_03]: rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've used the traditional monoculture
rate at the point of 112%.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you would reduce it by half if you're
going into planting green, mainly because
[SPEAKER_03]: of closure of the furrow, as well as,
I don't know if anyone's proved this yet,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that cover crops, if they're
trying to do that, they will hold moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: and not pump it out, like people talk
about in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's at a reduced rate and you have
decent air flow, you'll have better
[SPEAKER_03]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think another reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have within that same drop down
box, if you're dealing with mixes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get some choices there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these will influence the monoculture
rate, which goes into, I'm going to skip
[SPEAKER_03]: this slide for a moment, which I'll show
you the monoculture rate will then be
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulated by competition factors and
cover factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the purpose is, the cover crop
capillary has multiple purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are some of the rationale that
I've used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have soil health general,
what's called soil health increase,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that was decided that within NRCS,
we do have a soil health increase,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're sort of concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, it's used when organic matter
is low in general, and the rates allow for
[SPEAKER_03]: most species to go to coexist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives you opportunities to claim
that that's sort of the highest rate for
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the species so that they coexist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil health maintenance are most of the
species at their lowest rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when the farmer has a long history
of being doing no-till cover crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's no other resource concerns,
but we're seeing that farmers really want
[SPEAKER_03]: to have low heating rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we do have choices to bring down
those rates to low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nitrogen is for areas where there's low
nitrogen situations, where we want to have
[SPEAKER_03]: a mix while fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be higher legumes,
lower rates of grasses and grasses to
[SPEAKER_03]: allow those legumes to be utilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Erosion is high in great mixes of grasses,
but some species, especially the clovers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not given that choice because we
know that your clovers are going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: out-competed by your grasses, and you're
using this choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compaction-utilized species with taproots
and other complementary species.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a water quality nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of similar to erosion,
slightly different, and it has highest
[SPEAKER_03]: rates of grasses and lowest rates of
legumes and grasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this could be debated on where you
are in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the brassicas will terminate too
soon, will allow for the nitrogen to leach
[SPEAKER_03]: out before we can plant the next crop,
let the macro core issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you're in Maryland, you know,
that would not be the case, and maybe you
[SPEAKER_03]: have larger amounts, you could tolerate a
little bit more of the grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, similarly, no-till and planting
grain that are lower rates, which you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purposes are for the mixes and not for
the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: The monoculture is only manipulated by the
breeding method.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is behind the scenes of what drives
the calculator.
[SPEAKER_03]: A part of what I'm showing you is that the
monoculture rate, based on your purposes,
[SPEAKER_03]: will multiply that monoculture rate by
0.15 or 0.25, in this case, 0.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: For soil health, maintenance is lower,
so the bottom line will be lower for
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your legumes are going to be high,
like I mentioned before, your brassicas
[SPEAKER_03]: and grasses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try to pull up the calculator.
Hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll enable the content, and we'll go to
the calculator.
Let's just start off with soil health in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reset the table, and it'll ask you
whether you want to do it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I didn't do, I don't know if you
can see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about seven different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I could bring it up here or
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start off with different types of
covers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably can't see this, but they're
color-coded, and there's brassicas,
[SPEAKER_03]: clover with cool season legumes,
this is the category, cool season broadly
[SPEAKER_03]: for diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool season with asalia,
flax, and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool season grasses, then cool season
grains, warm season broadly competitive,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be like buckwheat,
warm season broadly less competitive,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, with the sunflower,
warm season grasses, and warm season
[SPEAKER_03]: legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have those categories, and you go to
your calculator, and the first thing you
[SPEAKER_03]: do is you select your category or type.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one we'll do is brassica,
and then it gives you a choice of species,
[SPEAKER_03]: and behind the scenes, and there hasn't
been probably enough work, it lists,
[SPEAKER_03]: it rates the species for that particular
purpose, but it rates it not only just for
[SPEAKER_03]: the monoculture rate, it also is a rating
related to the concept of it being in a
[SPEAKER_03]: mix, which makes it even more complicated
than trying to rate it as a monoculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's what that's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it gives you the seed per pound,
it gives you a cost per pound,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is a planning tool because your
cost is going to change based on the
[SPEAKER_03]: vendor, based on mixing costs,
so this just kind of gives you an idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: gives you the monoculture rate,
gives you that competition factor that I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned, and gives you that adjust in
this factor, and then it gives you a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar type factor, and the reason for
that would be if you were to select
[SPEAKER_01]: another brassica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, go back to brassica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in brassica, you get another choice,
so you put in hybrid rate, and it
[SPEAKER_03]: populates that, and what it does is
basically for similar cover types,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will give a similar cover type factor,
and will divide that first rate in half so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're not accumulating more and more
seed based on how many different species
[SPEAKER_03]: within that cover type that you use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll add a few more species here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things about this calculator,
which I think is really great and I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: take credit for it, is how kind of
transparent and how easy it is to be
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulated and changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're utilizing the calculator for
NRCS specs, then we have to kind of pre
[SPEAKER_03]: this, but if you are a researcher or if
you are a seed company, then there might
[SPEAKER_03]: be the opportunity for people in different
regions to change that, to kind of have an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now a cover crop, a mix in my definition
is it's got to be at least a cover type.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mixing just oats and rye together might
reduce your overall amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we have multiple species in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we end up here with,
without much planning, is something like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't see it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have about 0.5 and 0.4 pounds of the
brassica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three pounds of the sweet clover,
spring seed 22.5, or it can be Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: winter seed, probably be a similar rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 28 pounds of the triticale and 24
pounds of the oats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gives you on the bottom,
it'll accumulate, it'll let you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: the total amount of seed is, 78.4 pounds,
38.9 seeds per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it'll give you the percentage of each
of the species and count per acre and feed
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will give you basically the price
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is for planning purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the nice things about this
calculator is also that if you populate it
[SPEAKER_03]: and then decide to change that maybe you
want to do soil health maintenance,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you just put that in there and
everything automatically gets changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to re-enter things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did mention earlier that certain species
like the nitrogen production might not be
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably the sweet clover,
since it's very slow to emerge,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably... The sweet clover in
the...
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in there, but the competition
factors change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you could see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, we have 0.3 pounds of
each of the brassicas, five pounds of the
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet clover, 30 pounds of the pea,
14 pounds of the triticale, and 52.8
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds of the veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mentioned earlier is that if you,
as a collaborative to do research or to
[SPEAKER_03]: change things, you don't have to reprogram
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to change this to any number,
you basically just type over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not gonna spend the time to go
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to trust me on the fact that
all you need to do is the next time you
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it up, it'll be at that 40%.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to add species, you would...
Essentially, you would copy this and you
[SPEAKER_03]: would insert... This will work.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would do is I would insert first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, if you wanted to insert a
species, you would insert a column.
You would copy this, if I could do it this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to do a direct copy instead
of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what you would do, you would do
what I'm doing, but you would have to
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly laboriously cross over here so
you're not doing the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would...
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trust me on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would simply have to copy and paste
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you would put down the new species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you'd have to add the
information off the internet or wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: for the feed per pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd have to come up with your
own competition factor, which is gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: probably similar to a similar species that
is in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we make those modifications,
you can save it in a different file and it
[SPEAKER_03]: will still be there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there is... First thing I would do,
if you ever get this, is to throw away a
[SPEAKER_03]: copy to our toy that you're never happy to
play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to have to... You don't
want to have to... Yeah, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also...
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there's two other ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to say organic or you want to
have something for pest control,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can basically type in... This is a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would type in a new purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to populate the species rating
system there, as well as you would have
[SPEAKER_03]: over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have one in here where I put
the tester, but you would populate your
competition factors.
So you can very easily just add a couple
other places to add other purposes to the
calculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think with that, I can end it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any questions...
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first question... The dicon,
the teledradiate, probably should not
[SPEAKER_03]: be...
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think I have... I think I've
talked about a rustic in the PowerPoint,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's variety not collected in the
calculator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tomorrow, if you're at the Plum
Materials Center, we have cultivar trials
[SPEAKER_03]: that are multi-center around the country
and with other people doing research
[SPEAKER_03]: related to cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we definitely don't take it down to
cultivar level.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pretty amazing, interesting
things that are going on with cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Florida cultivar of rye that
you'll see is fully headed out and is
[SPEAKER_03]: almost as tall as the rye is in spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will winter kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll almost be like a roll of rye
without having to fill it or roll it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested in different barley
that might winter kill or partially winter
[SPEAKER_03]: kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even think the Midwest Recover
Crop Council pool is ever going to get to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these cultivars are kind of
expensive and people don't want to spend a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will be some cultivars that
might be adventurous like that Florida
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if this is what is
happening with rye and rye and rye and rye
and rye and rye and rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change the purposes to resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called it before, I guess you could
relate, most people wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called it organic matter increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I did this presentation in poster
form, I think an ARS scientist said,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, you shouldn't put increase in there
because you can't prove it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I changed it to general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I first put increase,
it has been related exactly to resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually do have it in New York as
our job sheet or implementation
[SPEAKER_03]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year starting off, so far we
haven't had too much revolt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at the moment in a fixed format,
we could get it from the NRPS New York
[SPEAKER_03]: website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you a little bit easier how to
get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I can't give you the URL to
link directly to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a couple of clicks away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can probably give you a copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's available in a fixed format.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the competition factors might be a bit,
but they're using it for programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a research standpoint,
I've demonstrated very deeply.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I guess there's a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
