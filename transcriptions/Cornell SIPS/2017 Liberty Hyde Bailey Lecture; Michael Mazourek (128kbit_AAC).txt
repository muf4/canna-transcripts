[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris, and it's a pleasure to
see you all today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about some of my
connection to work in the farm-to-table
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, part of why it's really special
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up, my family has a farm not too
far down the road from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so working on that from Cornell has a
great special resonance with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about kind of why
farm-to-table matters, thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of food to us as we have,
throughout humanity, celebrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, express our gratitude for food or
the meals that bring us together,
[SPEAKER_00]: the meals you'll have here at Reunion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be kind of your gathering points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food has been really an essential event,
and sharing food has been an essential
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: through our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we've, in the past few generations,
one of the tendencies we've seen is for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be a bit more disconnected for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the movements we see is people
being very interested in reconnecting with
[SPEAKER_00]: where their food comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see more young farmers getting engaged
with agriculture again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see other people just wanting to be
connected to the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people just looking to see no more,
where is their food coming from,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel more connected to that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we have started to have this
movement, this reappreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting with food and how it's grown
and can be grown locally, sourced locally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and feel more kind of connected to the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that helps build and
empower communities and new varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: new cultivars to help that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one of the areas I contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extend beyond that, but it's one of the
areas that's the most personal and special
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that process, beyond just looking
at the benefits to create new varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: for a farm, for a grower, for the food
system, a critical thing is the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: in the food system, all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we empower us to be navigating
that with the choices that we're wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to make, trying to make, thinking about
freshness, nutrition, sustainability,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the choices we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find our way through the food
system with so many new crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many opportunities to get food,
so many opportunities to get produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know that we're making the
choices we think we're making?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my apologies for anyone that has
any memories of taking multiple choice
[SPEAKER_00]: tests in this room before and call
auditorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the test, the choice you might
have in the marketplace is looking between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two squash and which one is the
ripest, which one is the most nutritious.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them happens to be ripe and ready
for the market, and the other one is not
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you tell which one is the most
delicious, most nutritious?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about if through plant breeding we
can change the question and make it an
[SPEAKER_00]: easier question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now A and B, which one is the ripest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a honey nut squash,
one of the products I've helped develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so clearly B is the ripe one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ripeness indicator, so like a
green versus a yellow banana, a green
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a red tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ripeness indicator, it empowers you
as you go through the grocery store to
[SPEAKER_00]: find, or the market to be able to find the
produce that's the ripest, that'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also, not only can you tell when
it's ripe, it's naturally more nutritious,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has more vitamin A, a great antioxidant
for your health, pro-vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the honey nut squash all the way on
your right, B, will have three times the
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene content, this pro-vitamin A
activity, as the ripest of the squash on
[SPEAKER_00]: your left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10 times as much as you would find on
the less ripe one you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this gives you a way to be able to
find something that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious when you bring it home to your
family, when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that you get the flavor,
the nutrition, and not only is it
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is helping some farms to be
able to have an identifiable product where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can kind of guarantee the quality,
and you can understand what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, it also helps people change some
of their dietary choices, because rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than going through the produce and finding
something maybe not to your taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can get them at their peak,
and maybe this is going to influence how
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it you can eat and have all these
great plant nutrients in your diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been a novel thing that wasn't
very fast initially to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I have a great ally in this
process, so I am very fortunate to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with a renowned farm-to-table chef,
Dan Barber, one of the world leaders in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we started to develop this and kind
of the co-creation of this new squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was working with him in the fields,
the opportunity to taste together,
[SPEAKER_00]: see the techniques, how we get the most
flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here is before I was savvy to Instagram
a while ago, so I started to eat it before
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see this beautiful small squash,
something that's convenient, that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: some family sizes nowadays, is able to be
more of a side dish rather than kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: filling up a dish, concentrating the
flavor, concentrating the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also one of the things it does that we
didn't realize at the time is on the plate
[SPEAKER_00]: it can resemble what it looks like in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really bringing some of that
field present to you on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of some of the
farm-to-table connection it can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has received a lot of popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been described in many food
magazines, media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have seen us talking about it on
Netflix in a great documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's achieved one of the things that
few vegetables get to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples, we'll know by variety name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be going to the orchards at
homecoming in the fall and be getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: Snapdragon apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a butternut squash that's
actually sold by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a butternut squash, but honey nut
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we continue to go along,
there's been a lot we can do to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: food we have available to us in the farms
that can grow for us more exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: more distinctive, to be able to really
showcase what we're developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: give consumers, give all of us new flavors
to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in many of the seed catalogs
you'll see this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the white cucumber behind me,
martini, that has also a fantastic yield
[SPEAKER_00]: for the grower and a much more delicious,
refined flavor than many other cucumbers
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The habanero pepper, which is a habanero
pepper with the spice removed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it keeps the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The habanero peppers, you can experience
all those flavors without the burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a great way to see all this
depth of flavor that's in the produce
[SPEAKER_00]: around us and some diversity to really
help make some of the produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive with some of the other food
choices we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can continue to push this and work
for some more ornamental edibles and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get peppers that are both loaded with
vitamin C and are just a nice snack size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a more convenient way to be able
to be eating delicious, hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling produce and also a plant that
even as an ornamental kind of works in
[SPEAKER_00]: many more areas than we might have
available to grow food for those of us
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have to have more of a balcony
space than a garden space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this process, as I continue to
be really excited about this co-creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of this avant-garde produce, new,
exciting, increasing the flavor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal of it and making it more noticeable
and enjoying seeing farmers and corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: this into what they're growing,
I had started to really think this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: farm to table was about, to be able to get
all these great new exciting things for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate that, again,
this is where Chef Barbara came in to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct me and say, well, no, it's not
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supporting the food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also, it's really about trying to
figure out, so farm to table, and so what
[SPEAKER_00]: do the farms have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best way to support the bounty
that's there sustainably on the farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we integrate that into our diet,
into what's being served and showed and
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found myself in some interesting
breeding projects at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, beginning of the season before you
are having a harvest from a field or right
[SPEAKER_00]: before the frost like it is in this top
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've gotten all the ripe produce
that there is out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cultures outside the US,
they would be looking at how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid wasting all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we are starting to
tackle is how to look at food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the project that we kind of evolved
into is looking at this field and figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: out, well, here's a field of squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this foliage has left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this be something that we could
incorporate into our cuisine, adapt to our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, what some other cultures do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although I spent much of my time here
selecting for the tastiest squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found myself going through the field
finding the tastiest squash stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And joined looking for something that we
can get this other food that kind of fits
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan's visions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ended up with actually a
delightful squash penne pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gluten free, it just comes right
from the squash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that is abundant
throughout the field, throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, and is something that is
nutritious and fitting right into another
[SPEAKER_00]: use a farm can have for much of what it's
already producing that would otherwise be
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the challenges, some of you might
be close to experiencing some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have gardens at home that dreaded
cucumber beetles as they come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat squash especially, and as they
defoliate the squash, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: different controls we can use and
insecticides that now we're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss more about how they may be
impacting pollinator health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at ways to avoid that,
it turns out there's some natural
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity within squash we can start to
leverage and use to be able to create
[SPEAKER_00]: squash that the beetles will leave alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we will still find tasty,
but the beetles will find distasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's as simple as see a golden
zucchini here that the beetles will
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly ravage, and a straight neck or
crook neck summer squash that they leave
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me as a plant breeder, it is as
simple as crossing the two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: together across pollination, and then
going through the generations to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find where I've kind of merged the best
of all those characteristics towards a
[SPEAKER_00]: more sustainable harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's not the only insight
threat out there, and talking to growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the southeast who have given up growing
zucchini, as we're about to be flooded
[SPEAKER_00]: with zucchini, you can kind of imagine
what threat they must be to not produce
[SPEAKER_00]: zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other squash, squash that are
naturally resistant to some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: pests, insects you might experience in
your garden, in your fields and your
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So above me here is a tromboncino squash,
an Italian heirloom squash, selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor that you don't see much in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I try to work with Dan to how
can we adapt this to some of other ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking and preparation, and also to make
it more delicious and sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: through a variety of taste tests,
we are able to find some of my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that are excelling in the kitchen,
and are delicious and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really what much of the farm
to table, the farm to fork movement have
[SPEAKER_00]: meant to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both trying to create new varieties
to really excite us and nourish us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we can find them and incorporate
them into our diets more and more out of
[SPEAKER_00]: just a natural beyond, like we should be
eating these things more, but a drive and
[SPEAKER_00]: desire to eat them more, and also ensuring
that we're also really thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, the grower, and how we can take
things that are thriving for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and incorporate that into our vision and
plan for this new cuisine.
