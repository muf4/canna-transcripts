[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I'd like to introduce Marvin,
who's going to say a few words about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreer Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the wonderful things about Cornell
is they introduce pockets of money around,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people don't often know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pretty big pocket of money
called the Dreer Award that's set up to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow graduate students to travel
somewhere internationally to supplement
[SPEAKER_02]: their career or their research or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about $28,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: $28,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometime in March, April, we invite
graduate students to submit a proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very onerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to submit five or six pages of
what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to meet with a committee of
three for like 20 minutes and explain what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we make a decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the easiest money you would ever get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only requirement is after you travel
and you do your study, you come back and
[SPEAKER_02]: give a seminar to all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open to landscape, architecture,
and horticultural graduate students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our speaker today was the recipient of
the Dreer Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let Justine introduce.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll come up to the microphone just so the
online folks can hear me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Justine Vanden Heuvel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a professor of viticulture in SIPs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm pleased to be here to introduce
Kobi Chok.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Kobi's undergrad is from the University
of Hawaii at the NOAA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he grew up in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did spend a semester at the NOAA.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a professor at University of
Massachusetts Amherst, where he actually
[SPEAKER_08]: took his first viticulture course.
[SPEAKER_08]: His background is in economics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when he was here, we actually designed
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did a cost analysis of a spatial
sampling protocol that we had designed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that paper was recently published in
the American Journal of Acknowledging
[SPEAKER_08]: Viticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very proud of the work that he's
done here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a pleasure to have him in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad he has kept up the long line of
my students who have then gotten the Dreer
[SPEAKER_08]: and gone off and done amazing things
around the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're thrilled to have him here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, Kobi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Justine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I'd like to thank Justine and
thank the Dreer committee, as well as all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people who made it possible for me
to go and learn all the things that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, my presentation today
is going to be covering tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's a little different
than standard winemaking and standard
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm interested is,
as Justine mentioned, I'm from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down the road, I plan on starting a
vineyard and winery in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this picture here is of me at the
vineyard I was interning at in Thailand in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kauai area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regions that I visited is in
Thailand, Brazil, and India, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the Kauai area, as I mentioned
previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winery I was at is Grand Monte
Vineyard and Winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This region up here is further north than
some of the other regions that also have
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards and wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the largest concentration of
wineries were located in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, Thailand has two significant
seasons that are pretty consistent every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a winter and then a summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the winter, I'm sorry, they have a
monsoon season and then a dry season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the monsoon season, as you can imagine,
is very wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't propagate or grow any vines,
grapes that year, that part of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that time, they just pretty much
prune and expect vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want any grapes because even if
they had grapes, they would be swallowed
[SPEAKER_00]: with water, they would get a lot of
diseases, and it's just not worth
[SPEAKER_00]: producing any grapes during that time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further down south in this area,
there's another vineyard that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vineyard also has a monsoon season,
so they also don't go and have two yields
[SPEAKER_00]: per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a lot more sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to this region on the right,
there is one vineyard that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're no longer there, but this
region was closer to the region southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second region that I visited is in
Petrolina, Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Petrolina, it is described as
semi-arid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very dry for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was there, they said that it was
actually the wettest it had been in 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in every 10 years, they get a lot of
rain and it was actually flooding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's so rare that they can
continuously harvest 365 days a year
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the most unique regions
that I visited for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little further south in Brazil,
as more of you are familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: is São Paulo, where they have other
vineyards in three different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here, a little bit to the north of São
Paulo.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit further south and then to the
west of São Paulo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little bit closer to the
traditional 30 to 50 latitude that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect wine to be grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they grow it here and it's pretty
unique as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last place I visited was in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the Nashik region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Nashik region, it is also
pretty dry and arid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, I would say, a little bit
cooler than a lot of the other regions I
[SPEAKER_00]: visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still within the tropics,
unlike if you went to further south in
[SPEAKER_00]: India, it would be in the traditional
latitude as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through, instead of
describing each place that I visited,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the vineyard management practices and
we can kind of see how things were
[SPEAKER_00]: different or similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is vine propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, because vineyards
aren't as common in these regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really have a large supply of
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the vines that they do have were
all imported in small shipments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was grown based off of the
material that they already had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is going to bring up
problems of potential virus transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: as you propagate vines that have viruses
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, certain vineyards,
especially this one that I was at in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, they tried to take precautions
to kind of prevent or at least mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see on the top left,
this is the fresh cuttings that they got
[SPEAKER_00]: from the vines and the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defoliated the branches and then pruned
them to lengths of about a foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in the bottom left,
this is when we were, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilizing the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we pruned them, we stuck them in
a hot water bath at, I believe it was 50
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius, maybe it was 80 degrees
Celsius for about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some papers about using this
method to kind of kill any diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: are present and try to prevent the
spreading of any trunk diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we finished that, they were stuck in
pots with instead of like coco coir,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a lot of rice down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was that rice hull vine material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tops of the vines were painted
with paint mixed with fungicide to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: close the wound on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few months, or actually a couple
months, then this picture here is what the
[SPEAKER_00]: result was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see something similar when I
visited Petrillion in Brazil, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: also propagated all of their own vines as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For vineyard establishment, it was pretty
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, they kind of just planted vines
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you don't have to wait for fall
or spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just plant whenever you feel like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Thailand, they did something a
little bit more unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of grafting the vines before
planting, they actually planted the root
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks and then field grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their explanation to me of why they did
this is because instead of having the
[SPEAKER_00]: scion that has your desired grape variety
on top immediately, allowing the root
[SPEAKER_00]: stock to take off and be as vigorous as
they can to really establish its root
[SPEAKER_00]: system is what they were going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later, we would go into grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just thought this was a little
interesting on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of using a stick to pull it up
vertically, they tie it on like this
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing line almost and tie it to the top
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought that was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't seen it previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll move to the grafting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you comment just briefly on the
sparklings that people asked before where
[SPEAKER_08]: it's from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from that Brazil region that I
mentioned previously in Petrillion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variety is muscatel, which is a type
of muscat, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really common wine from the
region that dry, semi-arid region
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily makes white wine and sparkling
wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: For red wines, it's just not the best
climate for it, I guess, because there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't enough fluctuation in temperature
between day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also receive a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said that whenever they get
certain red grapes, it comes out very
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tannins break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing left as far as
complexity in the reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the most popular wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottle, I believe, is under $5 US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market is for the local Brazilian
wine drinkers who are relatively new,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, to wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they like their beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is muscat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for grafting, this is field grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the cyan variety that was
refrigerated from the previous pruning in
[SPEAKER_00]: the monsoon season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taken out of the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root stock was split down the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cane is shaved to a flat
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleft grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one bud is cut from that cane and
inserted in two to the slot, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped tightly with this plastic wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty standard cleft grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that they noticed
here is sometimes the plastic gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: the graft union, which will cause the vine
to die after a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the downsides of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a lot more labor intensive
to go into the field rather than bench
[SPEAKER_00]: grafting in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll move to training systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another very unique thing to
the tropical regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often than not for the wine grapes,
you would see double cordon or single
[SPEAKER_00]: cordon VSP systems, as you see on the top
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Grand Monte Winery in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this typically works very well for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, for the more
vigorous varieties, I think the only
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that that winery did cane pruning
was for their muscat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it was all double cordon spur
pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The training system that you saw in Brazil
was often similar, although sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: saw high wire cordons in this middle
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Brazil, because the region is also
known for their table grape growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had regular pergolas that they also
grew table grapes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did this for wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this method is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's a lot less
control over how many buds you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many clusters you have, unless you go
through and kind of go underneath to
[SPEAKER_00]: really look at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because this vineyard didn't have too
much mechanical operations, it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this middle picture at the bottom is
in India, where, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: their training system is also this Y
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justine, do you know the name for where
they split it into a Y?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the Y system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Thailand, they also use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually where they saw the
best quality grapes and the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Thailand didn't regularly use this for
all of their grapes because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanize really anything in that block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system on the bottom right is in
Thailand as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they use it for root stock growth so
that they can propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a really easy method for
them to grow the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as pruning goes, in Thailand,
the first thing they did was count the
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they split the buds to see how many
inflorescents they're expecting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: year to estimate how many buds to prune
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's five to six buds per spur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would only keep a couple on the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, they use diagonal pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five to six buds per spur is what they
said to be a better amount of spurs to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep for yield rather than vegetative
growth at the lower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then similar to how we did the
grafting, they also sealed the pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: wounds with a mix of fungicide with paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growing cycle is something that is
very distinct from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, in Thailand,
they are able to have two growing seasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they only harvest in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of look at this and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the rainfalls average between
2001 and 2011, as well as temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have noticed that it has gotten
warmer and that rain has been a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more variable because of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought this was a good chart to
show because it really covers and
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights a lot of different things
happening in the vineyard throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see pruning number one happens in
April through May, and that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pruning number two happens
September through October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fruit's set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when they're looking to get
their quality grapes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see a distinct drop in
rainfall in the season, 24 millimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: versus between 120 and 220.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty distinct difference in
rainfall, which is why they go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: season to be the pruning season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pest pressures is also down here
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover some of these pests a
little bit more later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see at different points in the
season they experience these diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, birds will always be there,
but can't do too much about that other
[SPEAKER_00]: than putting a net or making some noise of
cannons or lasers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to do what they do here,
they induce dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior to pruning, they spray ethyphon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is really kind of prep
the plant and induce it to dormancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we prune it and whistle defolie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go ahead and remove the leaves with a
hedger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have people going through,
just taking off the bulk of the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is generally how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a couple days later, they will then
apply hydrogen cyanamide to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe some spray it, but the
vineyard I was interning at, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in Thailand, they would actually go and
get the mixture and then paint it onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds rather than just spraying broadly,
because I guess the buds is where it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Thailand maybe a week after bud
burst, a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is almost immediately after
bud burst in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the ethyphon help to defoliate the
plants at all, or do they have to really
[SPEAKER_03]: go in and kind of aggressively defoliate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sprayed this about right before I
got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not exactly sure what it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice that there were some less
leaves, but there were still a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of leaves that needed to be pulled
off by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Koby, everyone kind of saw your second
wine, which was right there.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second wine here is from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Shiraz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're close to Australia,
they use a lot of Australian terms for
[SPEAKER_00]: these wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from Monsoon Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest winery in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think a little bit about
this wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this winery, they use hyper
oxidation in the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation process and then ferment it
more or less normally through the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: blend it with the different blocks to try
to get something consistent from year to
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to keep these in mind,
because at the end, I'd like to ask your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on these different wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit set happen pretty normally,
as you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through this slide
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest problem that they
experienced is downy mildew, as we could
[SPEAKER_00]: really get to the inflorescence before it
even sets, causing a big loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something unique, again, with these
regions is because they don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: winter coming up, they can't afford to be
a little late on the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one block that we visited
that was, I think, contracted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still went to check it out and see
how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had very, very poor fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had almost nothing because of downy
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was already a month or two into
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just pruned again and started all
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't there for when they harvested
this block.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I assume it worked out, because like I
said, they have a lot of time to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the canopy management
that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, I noticed probably the least
canopy management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were generally the messier vineyards
that I visited, as far as weed control and
[SPEAKER_00]: general maintenance of the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Brazil, you see them kind of
just taking a handheld hedging tool to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's hanging out into the
rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Thailand, this was probably
the most painful thing I did while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us lopping shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to go overhead and lop all day
for a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to keep it within the trellis
wire, so that way the growth was vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we lopped, we just took off
the tops, the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in Brazil, some of these were
hanging out on the side of the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would be cutting some branches
very short, doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But labor is really cheap in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they had just a few of us
going out there and manually removing the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the other canopy
management that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to remove all the downward-facing
shoots, because generally you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then early in the season, before bud
burst, we went through and removed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: little, buds that were coming up across
from the future clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really try to keep the fruit zone
open for disease reasons, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through, before the vine got
massive and really vigorous, and removed
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these little shoots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also removed, this is shoot selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, we only select two shoots
per spur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you don't have too much vigor
across the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you can see here, it already
gets pretty developed in terms of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: development and fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through and leaf pull for better
air circulation and sun exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leaf pulled only on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the side that was facing the
west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, in the morning, it would be
kind of protected from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: In midday, the whole canopy will protect
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll get a little bit more sun
exposure in the afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see how much they leaf pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much remove all the leaves
from the lower part of the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a lot from the fruit zone as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative management.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of irrigation, it was all water
sources that were available right on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, this is Petrolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big lake, the San Francisco River.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this lake is what they pull the water
into through this pump system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then would irrigate their fields with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, similarly, the main vineyards
site, where they have this big pond,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have this pump house that would
pump water through to the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would use this for fertigation as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in another site in Thailand,
they also have water right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture of this,
but in the southern vineyard in Thailand
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a little bit more sandy,
of course, they have better drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a little drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need to be watering it a little
more frequently, because generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are sandy soil, the water is just
going to go right through, and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a lot of retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also had a water shortage for
that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to determine which blocks they
would just kind of neglect for the year
[SPEAKER_00]: and not water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were certain blocks, because of
water shortages, that they just wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: water, because there is no county water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really feasible to bring in
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like many other regions, especially in
California, water can be a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's generally not in a lot of
tropical regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can pour this next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess before we get there, let me just
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next line is a, Justine,
how do you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Barbera is from Brazil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's known to be a little bit
more tannic and bigger water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this region, as I said before,
it's also a region that is known not to
[SPEAKER_00]: have great reds and known to have low
tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see what your thoughts are,
because typically, the better wines that I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried were the ones that were typically
supposed to be bolder, because I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have that loss, you still have a
higher amount to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you lose some of the tannin,
then it's not as big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I didn't try this one,
so I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the other side of it, because it is
so tropical, sometimes you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, you have the monsoon season,
a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, generally, you don't have too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do, it can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across all of the regions I noticed,
rays grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of mounded growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left side, this is India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's a hump where
the vines are planted in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also Brazil on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I put one of Thailand in
here, but I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did that to kind of keep the water
table a little bit lower by having the
[SPEAKER_00]: vines start off at a higher point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then aside from that, there were also
vineyards in Brazil where they had
[SPEAKER_00]: trenches that they dug to kind of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of tile drainage, where you dig,
you set the tiles, and then you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cover it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just dug it and left it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have pipes, or not pipes,
other trenches going across this way in
[SPEAKER_00]: some rows that drain into this main
trench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way that they kind of either
lowered the water table or kept the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the major pests that were there
are worms, caterpillars, and thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as mealybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, can anybody define or see
any pests here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right here on this leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's a mealybug.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for sure a mealybug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone know what this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are worm eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see this worm in the tropics
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're common here or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the egg nests for these
worms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also large caterpillars in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of freaky when you came
across one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were these weird horn
beetles that would bore into some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: trunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically eat into this spur across
part of this trunk and went in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept cutting back, cutting back,
cutting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ended up cutting off this whole
part of the cordon because it was eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too common, but it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from insect pests, there are also
other animal predation pests, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, you would have these big birds
and sometimes toucans come and eating your
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Thailand, you would have monkeys
coming in from the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as once in a while, you'd have
elephants marching into the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had barbed wire fence and all
around the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one section where the elephant
didn't care and they just come right
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not much you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a tough situation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, it's not too common.
[SPEAKER_00]: For viruses, root pressure stem pitting is
a common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf roll is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I mentioned, they propagate
their own vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no virus-free initiatives
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more of these viruses
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is some kind of virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be possibly leaf roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea, Justine,
or anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this trunk was also split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's butchery, sophoria,
trunk disease as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I'm being shown here by
the vineyard manager in southern Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is actually from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did an internship there and liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was asked to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he stayed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been working there for about 12
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting because this guy,
as well as the person I was working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: both were trained in the more traditional
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trained in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that I was working under in
Thailand, she was trained in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they both have a better idea of some of
the scientific developments and other good
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed management was another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, people spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: India didn't really have too much weed
management happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One vineyard in Thailand had sheep that
they were looking through their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a organic vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tried to not use too many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sheep, and then in this other vineyard
I was interning at, they used hose,
[SPEAKER_00]: these white base hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of just dug up the weeds under
the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it took a lot of manual effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But works, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diseases, downy mildew, powdery
mildew, anthracnose are common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some anthracnose on these grapes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildew on this leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's powdery on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a lot of disease in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the organic vineyard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did for this is they had
their typical sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, they would use
some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My notes didn't transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have other sprays, such as this
type of,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This presentation was supposed to be on my
laptop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it here and didn't share this
other part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's some kind of biological control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look it up after and let you know
what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuous harvesting in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to touch on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike Thailand, where they have so
much rain in one season and no rain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other, they were just dry year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could just continuously harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you prune the vine,
you could then go ahead and start the next
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these pictures were all
happening within one month of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, they're all in very
different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have recently pruned.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bud burst at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here you see vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're just across the aisle
from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in very different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another vineyard at the same time
is also almost ready to harvest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a very unique opportunity for
these vineyards and possibly a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to explore further as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That side of that here are some other
interesting things that I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can anybody see the snake in this
bottom picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the snake head here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is when it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was actually stepping on this snake
when we were grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting down on a stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cutting the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt the ground moving under me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wasn't sure what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought maybe I just dehydrated
because it was very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the mid 90s with 90% humidity,
full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we ended up doing for the next
hour is catching the snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we released it right across the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably came right back the next
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we caught the snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a different snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tree snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit more scary because when
we're working in the canopy, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally touch the snake or get too
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might bite you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, someone saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we whacked it with a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one won't be coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just another thing that I
wanted to bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really sure what to make of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But air roots were very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it as much, I would say,
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were on a lot of the vines and
quite a bit of it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if anyone here has any
experience with why this might be the case
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to kind of see it a lot in
more humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Long Island, for example, it's actually
quite common, aerial roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see it very often up here unless
it's very humid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the humidity somehow the
plant wants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very typical to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of the people that
I worked with who hosted me while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the vineyards that they
grew table grapes but they also made wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the third wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last one that you just had was from
this vineyard that they grew it on an
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead pergola.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another block of the same
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this picture, it is in another
Petrolina vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is the, OK, this is a
different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first one that you had the sparkling
was this vineyard that I visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make a lot of sparkling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make wine for a lot of different
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a huge facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the people that I
interned, worked with in Thailand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there has to be a vineyard
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand had vineyard five dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one was named Nam Tam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we can move to question as
Manushi pours this last wine that is from
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the vineyard that I interned at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that they had the best wine
overall that I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What cultivar is this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Petit Seurat Durif.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the typical?
[SPEAKER_06]: Timeline for production there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they try to avoid the monsoon season,
or do they figure out a way to work that
[SPEAKER_06]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they pretty much have a full growing
cycle during the monsoon season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just remove all the grapes so the
plant can just have vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unfortunately, and fortunately,
I guess, the vines don't experience any
[SPEAKER_00]: natural dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it's going to keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't make it stay dormant for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come back sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than just keep killing
everything that's out there, they just let
[SPEAKER_00]: it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it just have vegetation and then prune
it before the season that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, between in September,
they prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit set's going to be in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's September through October,
because a lot of different blocks take
[SPEAKER_00]: time to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also start off with, I believe,
the reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do the whites, because the whites
have a shorter growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit set happens here generally,
and then grows through December,
[SPEAKER_00]: January.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sparkling, they'll harvest in
January, typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do an earlier harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reds, February, the bigger reds,
like this one, so maybe Cabernet
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauvignon, could be end of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, I think it can go through maybe
early April.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually by March, that's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the trade management?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of fertilizer do they use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they use organic fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic isn't too big of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the vineyards don't do organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that I showed you with the sheep
is the only one that I know of who goes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their way to use organic
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the exact types of fertilizer,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a discussion that I had with
Justine yesterday about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and fungicides that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave me this sheet, their spray
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of it's in Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you translate it, it didn't
exactly come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not exactly sure what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that they fertilize across,
I think, several of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to, they fertilize quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd assume it's more or less standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to kind of depend on the
situation of each vineyard, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need for their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But regarding the amount of sunlight,
cloud cover that you can see throughout
[SPEAKER_04]: the varying seasons that people choose to
use, find that some regions had more
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent sunlight, or is it variable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for Thailand specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, in September, October,
it's still the very edge or end of monsoon
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some rain and cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to the end of October,
November, it is very, very sunny,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hot all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: December and then January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go further south to the other
vineyard, it is also very sunny,
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it can also be fairly sunny,
although there are clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, it would also be very sunny as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these regions had a lot of sun,
cloud cover occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't a regular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to be expected either too
often.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you've been in the other regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd say it's going to be great if
they're continuously growing and
[SPEAKER_07]: producing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have to do a little more replants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard that in the southern part of
Brazil, they do have to do replants a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually, not southern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The northern part of it, they need to do
it more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I heard from some people who
told me outside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I spoke to the folks at one of
the vineyards there, they were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so new that they're not entirely sure
how long the vines will last.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only really planted about 30 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their oldest block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't had to do a replant yet
for that block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the most established,
longest lasting vineyards there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as they know, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not any shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the continuous harvesting thing,
so you mentioned sprays to force dormancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing continuous harvesting,
can you get more grapes to grow just by
[SPEAKER_03]: pruning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you always have to spray something
to force the vine dormancy first?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or can you just prune it and it'll grow
more grapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could prune it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the idea behind spraying is to
kind of allow the plant sometime to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: back some nutrients back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To its roots and kind of store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of being able to just prune,
that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the bigger thing is coming out of
dormancy, applying the Cyanamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the Cyanamide is a bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you will get bud bursts regardless
of whether you apply that or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this allows for more uniform bud
bursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, what you may see is bud bursts
towards the edges because of epical
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the middle might not have very
much or might be weaker growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the outer ones are going to be
a lot more developed by the time the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle one even bursts, it's going to have
uneven ripening if you have fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outer ones can overtake the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the middle might not grow enough at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the vineyards in Brazil
specifically mentioned instead of using
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyanamide, they use a garlic mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's garlic in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I heard a couple of people using
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organic winery in Thailand also
said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it needs to be looked at a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see one paper that kind of mentions
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I find it, I can send it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is supposedly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take you with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a question for just a general
throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assume you're not fluent in
Portuguese or Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did it work not being a native
speaker and communicating with growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: managers and so forth?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you advise other students to go
to places even though they might not speak
[SPEAKER_02]: that language?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the experience was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The places that I got more from,
I would say, were the ones that spoke some
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the place I interned at,
she spoke English.
[SPEAKER_00]: She studied in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knew kind of what she was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the one in the south,
he was in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germans speak English more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also had a good idea of what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is a great thing to go out
and meet other people from other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's almost always someone who can
speak English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, like in, let's see,
Thailand, some places nobody spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people only spoke Portuguese and
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, we live in a good time when we
have Google Translate and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribe feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could just record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could just read exactly what they're
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of great opportunity now
that you can do that type of thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you wouldn't have been able to
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I wouldn't say that it's a
limiting factor at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so after they prune, some of it is
used for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of it is dumped into the
forest or somewhere because we're not very
rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a rural area and there's nobody
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have a big pile generally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gives a very nice aroma to the
meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Thailand, one of the vineyards
did sell some of the cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dried out cuttings for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it's a tradition or
something that everyone regularly does in
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mostly either composted or thrown
off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think you've learned that you
will apply to your time in or when you set
[SPEAKER_03]: up a place in Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I did notice is
certain varieties just don't do well at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, they didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, they didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those varieties is Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, they could barely get the
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there, but it has no fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been maybe four or five years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Brazil, there was a vineyard
that is growing Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're only getting about
maybe one case of wine per acre or
[SPEAKER_00]: something crazy low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to charge a ridiculous
amount for that bottle because it just
[SPEAKER_00]: costs a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's just certain varieties
don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain ones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petite Syrah, Syrah are very good,
as well as the canopy management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I forgot to mention in
preventing disease is whenever it rains,
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent downy mildew, they will just
take the sprayer through the vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just turn the fan on high and
blow off the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't spray anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just to dry out the flowers so
that they don't get downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I would probably do
because it's, from what I understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes all the difference in preventing
downy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe last question, and then we got to
wrap up.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was going to ask, how has the
market changed in these wines and these
[SPEAKER_07]: regions?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess are they exporting a lot,
or is it just kind of state?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, the market is very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their religion, I think it's Buddhism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually weren't supposed to drink,
I think, at one point, the strict
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddhists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the newer ones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it's beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Song beer and Chang are the two most
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine is a very new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some domestic tourists coming to
visit the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, it's the wealthier ones
because, I mean, the wages in US dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like $10 a day, so it's barely
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't really afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see the higher income
classes getting these wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Brazil, they're able to mechanize a lot
more than Thailand can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce cheaper wines that are
under $5 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do see more of a domestic market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil isn't exporting too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand is to the neighboring countries,
Singapore, China, these other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that have higher incomes, maybe not
overall, but higher income individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: that can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, that's about the extent,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please join me in thanking Koby.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're interested in the drear,
watch the horticulture blister and or
[SPEAKER_08]: reach out to Martin, who would be happy to
share some information.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank you.
Thanks.
