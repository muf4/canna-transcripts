[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start right at the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the name of our lab suggests,
we study fungi as model organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: really to try and understand evolutionary
processes and to try and understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms adapt to ever-shifting
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to start with just a brief
overview of the fungal kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: because not everyone is always so familiar
with them or thinking about them all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fungi, of course, are the largest
kingdom of microbial eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a group, they've been diversifying
for just over 1.5 billion years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might imagine, over this amount
of time, fungi have radiated out into
[SPEAKER_00]: basically all environments on Earth,
both terrestrial and aquatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've evolved a variety of different
strategies for survival across all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my lab, we take a comparative
approach to try and understand how fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity is generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than focus on just one model
system on one branch of the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try and leverage multiple model systems
across the fungal tree of life in a
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative framework to try and
understand what strategies are shared
[SPEAKER_00]: across different lineages, what strategies
might be more innovations particular to a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this way, we really try and
understand some of the foundational
[SPEAKER_00]: principles of fungal adaptation and fungal
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the types of variations that
we're most interested in studying in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lab are fungal interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because, sure, come no
surprise in a plant pathology and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology department, that fungal
interactions literally shape our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fungi have evolved to interact with
humans, with animals, with plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: with bacteria, and with other fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outcomes of these interactions are
really essential for the continued
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning of ecosystem processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe more visibly, the interactions
really impact very important aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: human society in terms of human health and
also global food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the goal in our lab is really to
understand fungal interactions as a
[SPEAKER_00]: process where a process is really
something that is continually unfolding
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested both in the ecological
dynamics and also evolutionary dynamics
[SPEAKER_00]: and eco-evo dynamics that are driving
fungal adaptations on the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are two main questions that
we're really interested in understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can boil them down to, first one,
when do good fungi turn bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really interested in
understanding the genetic drivers and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental drivers that can lead to
pathogen emergence, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a mutualist or commensal to a
disease-causing organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, and kind of
related, we're also interested in how do
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi learn new tricks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you establish pathogens,
for example, pick up new traits or evolve
[SPEAKER_00]: new traits that allow them to expand and
infect other hosts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do pathogens evolve new strategies
for overcoming host offenses or,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, some of the control
mechanisms or control strategies that we
[SPEAKER_00]: try and deploy out in the field to control
their impacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, of course, a major challenge when
studying fungal interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can boil these down to a question
of genotypic and phenotypic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as many plant pathologists in the room
will know, getting disease to happen or
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to induce a disease isn't really
always as simple as mixing together one
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic strain with one particular
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variation, certainly
between species, but also within species
[SPEAKER_00]: and across different populations and
lineages within the species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variation in how these
fungi are actually interacting with their
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an evolutionary biologist,
I think it's really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand where this variation comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is it generated and what are the
outcomes of this variation in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: practical sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think by understanding where
variation comes from and what the outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: are, we really position ourselves much
better to actually being able to get one
[SPEAKER_00]: step closer to being able to predict the
outcomes of different interactions as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're happening out in the field or even
within our own bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really another reason why a lot
of the questions that we ask in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: span from the within species level to
between species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as was briefly mentioned in the
introduction, my lab takes a three pronged
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to try and tackle this question
of how is variation generated in fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we take a computational biology
perspective, and this really allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: discover patterns that are unfolding in
large omics data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take an evolutionary genomics
approach to actually try and characterize
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the processes that are responsible
for generating these patterns that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: in these data sets and across different
species and in this way generate some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of comparative insight into how these
processes are unfolding across different
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal species and populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we try and tie it all
together with a molecular genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, trying to actually conduct some
functional characterization experiments to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually test the hypotheses that
computational biology and evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics are really so good at generating
and also conduct some manipulative
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in the lab along those same
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the past couple of years and
hopefully into the future, we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: applying this approach to a new and
emerging concept within the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal biology and fungal genetics,
and that's the concept of starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike this picture might suggest or
unlike what ChatGPT thinks a starship is,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are not the starships that our
spacecraft that you might have heard or
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in science fiction shows,
but rather these starships that we study
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab are a newly described
superfamily of transposable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think this scientist needs any
introduction in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'm looking at a picture of her
right now in the back right corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, transposons are these
really interesting features and entities,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic entities that live within
organismal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were discovered just over 80
years ago by Barbara McClintock,
[SPEAKER_00]: including some of her pioneering work done
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, through Dr. McClintock's
work, she showed that there are particular
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of the genome that are capable of
transposing themselves from one location
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was finding that the consequences
or outcomes of these interactions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at the genetic level can have
very important phenotypic outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of Dr. McClintock,
model organism maze, she was of course
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that this great variation in
pigmentation patterns could be traced back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the activity of just a single
transposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these effects were largely resulting
from where that transposon ended up as it
[SPEAKER_00]: moved itself between different positions
within the genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a consequence of her pioneering
work, scientists quickly began to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of the cases of adaptation that
we observe out in nature and in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: have been observing for decades and even
over hundreds of years, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cases of adaptation could ultimately be
traced back to the activity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly understood and previously hidden
features of organismal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the classic case, of course,
being the peppered moth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of students learn about this
example in Biology 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the classic case of adaptation where
during the Industrial Revolution in
[SPEAKER_00]: England, this particular moth species
underwent a shift to a darker pigment
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern that was better able to camouflage
it against trees that were accumulating
[SPEAKER_00]: soot from the Industrial Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a couple of years ago that
researchers went back, sequenced these
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes and realized that this change in
pigmentation phenotype, just like what Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: McClintock was seeing, was actually being
driven by the activity of transposable
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, if we want to learn more about
organismal adaptation, we really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: start paying attention to these often
hidden parts of the genome that can have
[SPEAKER_00]: these outsized phenotypic consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the 80 or so years since Dr.
McClintock first described a transposable
[SPEAKER_00]: element, the definition of a eukaryotic
transposable element has essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: remained unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the definition is a relatively short
piece of DNA that can just move itself
[SPEAKER_00]: from one location of the genome to the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's where things start to get a
little bit different when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: starship transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like their name suggests, the first
thing you need to know about a starship
[SPEAKER_00]: transposon is that it is much larger than
any other eukaryotic transposon described
[SPEAKER_00]: to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it can often be one to two orders
of magnitude larger than anything else you
[SPEAKER_00]: would find in a fungal genome or really in
any other eukaryotic genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, towards the upper range of
the starship-sized spectrum, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: starships that are actually approaching
the size of small fungal chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you a sense of the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a sense of perspective
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like other transposable elements,
starships have a recombinase that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: the captain, which is actually the only
gene that's both sufficient and necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for moving the entire element,
for transposing the entire element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some really elegant work was done by
Andrew Urquhart to show that this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond the captain, and here's where
things again start to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more interesting, the starships actually
carry many other protein-coding genes as
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic cargo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might expect from such a gigantic
transposon, there's a lot of room for
[SPEAKER_00]: other cargo to actually begin to
accumulate within the boundaries of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, at a fundamental level,
this is why starships are so special,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the ability to carry genetic cargo
gives them this ability to make complex
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions to organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we have a lot of different types
of transposable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here's a small little schematic,
just placing starships within the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: context of eukaryotic transposon
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom, we see the canonical
transposons, like the one Dr. McClintock
[SPEAKER_00]: was working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: These transposons are not capable of
carrying any genetic cargo beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinase that's responsible for
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, all of their phenotypic impacts
are largely gonna result from where they
[SPEAKER_00]: end up inserting in the genome,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they insert themselves in a promoter
region, this can lead to a change in gene
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they insert themselves into a
protein-coding sequence, that can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: the generation of a natural knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, their impacts are limited to
their transposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you increase the size of the
transposon, moving up this spectrum to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where you have starships,
because starships can carry dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes at one time, this gives them much
greater ability to impact phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their fungal hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the example of the starship here,
Hephaestus, which is one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: starships to be characterized,
this starship actually carries many
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes that are each involved in
detoxifying a different type of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this way, the starship, it's not
just contributing to a phenotype based on
[SPEAKER_00]: where it ends up in the genome,
although it certainly can do that as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but rather it's able to impact the
generation of phenotypic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what do we know about starships so
far?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from one of our early systematic
studies, we were able to categorize the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of starships into 11 major
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a phylogenetic tree
showing how all of those different
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences have evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, this is a very diverse
gene family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even within particular families,
but certainly between families,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different captain recombinases show
very, very little similarity to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, indicating that through some
combination of rapid evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also evolution over long periods of
time, these elements have been
[SPEAKER_00]: diversifying in fungal genomes for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we estimate just close to 400 million
years of evolution based on how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that starships, they're not a
kingdom-wide phenomenon, but rather
[SPEAKER_00]: they're concentrated within a particular
subphylum of filamentous fungi called the
[SPEAKER_00]: pisizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really lucky for us because many
of the fungi that cause diseases on humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and also on plants are found within the
pisizomycotina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some evidence of starships in some
pisizomycete lineages, but we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really quite sure how they have ended up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to figure that out right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as I was saying, the ability to
carry cargo has resulted in many different
[SPEAKER_00]: starships encoding very diverse traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we first described the starship
superfamily, people have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: other groups have been coming out with
many different papers and our groups as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, showing that different starships are
contributing in different ways to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotypes that we really care about
studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, phenotypes like virulence
evolution in plant pathogenic fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also heavy metal resistance,
like I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might notice, a lot of these
papers are currently still in the preprint
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really still are at the beginning of
understanding just how broad the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: starships are on fungal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to figure out what are the
parameters of this fungal adaptation and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my lab right now, what we're
doing is framing this question of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions through the lens of
starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're asking now, how are starships
actually mediating fungal interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: with both plant and animal hosts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially trying to understand what
are the parameters of this newly described
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of fungal evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the takeaway from today's talk,
I'll be sharing two recent stories that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come out of some of the work we've
been doing over the past year with many
[SPEAKER_00]: different collaborators, just showing
everyone here how starships really provide
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel for fungal evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you how they do this
on two different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is through generating genotypic
variation at the level of genome
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, but also at the level of genome
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, we'll start getting into
what I think is really going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next frontier of starship biology,
understanding the role of these elements
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mechanism of fungal horizontal gene
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this first part over here,
understanding contributions of starships
[SPEAKER_00]: to genome structure and genome content,
we were working with a large genome and
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic data set of the opportunistic
human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest in understanding
the genetic mechanisms of strain
[SPEAKER_00]: heterogeneity in this particular
opportunistic pathogen, just because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the number one killers of
immunocompromised patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were working with just over 500
short read genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also went ahead and sequenced 12 new
longer read genomes, which would give us
[SPEAKER_00]: this ability to actually be able to more
precisely resolve the dynamics that were
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at the population level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we essentially applied
this new tool that I developed for
[SPEAKER_00]: annotating starship elements to this data
set and ended up with this compendium of
[SPEAKER_00]: starships that are active within this
particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to walk you through how
we then interrogated this data set or
[SPEAKER_00]: interrogated this compendium to try and
understand now some of the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: foundational biology of these elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first things first, once we had all the
starships, what we did was we tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: classify them into different unique types,
because one starship, even though they're
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the same superfamily, can actually
be quite distinct from one another at a
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did that, we found that there
are at least 20 distinct starships that
[SPEAKER_00]: are actively transposing within this
particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, you'll see just a heat map
about how these 20 different starships are
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed across the population that we
worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, as you might expect from
a mobile element, and we know this from
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial mobile elements very often,
these genetic entities have very patchy
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions across different
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that recapitulated over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned that many of these
starships really share little to no
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence identity with each other,
indicating that many of them are carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: different combinations of cargo genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that I like to point out is
that, unlike a canonical transposon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will only ever find these starships in
a single copy within a particular genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there appears to be some mechanism
controlling copy number within this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that that mechanism can
break down because other species can
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate multiple copies, but we're
really still not quite sure what that
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism might be and whether it's
host-controlled or starship-controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the benefits with working with Fuma
goddess is that people have sampled this
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus from literally everywhere on Earth,
but also from outside Earth in space on
[SPEAKER_00]: the International Space Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of our isolates were indeed
sampled from the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can confirm that starships have made
it to space because we can find them up
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well, looking down on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we tried to understand where
these starships are found between
[SPEAKER_00]: different individuals, we then wanted to
understand where they're found within the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done here is map out the
eight chromosomes of the reference Fuma
[SPEAKER_00]: goddess strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 293.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the perimeter, I've indicated
all of these segregating starship
[SPEAKER_00]: insertion sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are sites in black over here
where starship is present in some other
[SPEAKER_00]: individual in the population, but absent
from this one particular reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in red over here, and you can see
the eight starships that are present in
[SPEAKER_00]: this one particular individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add up all of the sequence that's
contained within this mobile compartment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get upwards of two and a half percent
of genome content actually being located
[SPEAKER_00]: within these mobile elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we add up all of the different
insertion sites across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: population, there are just over 150 unique
insertion sites where starships are
[SPEAKER_00]: generating this genome-wide structural
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you a sense of the upper
bounds of starship mediated structural
[SPEAKER_00]: variation, over here, I'm showing the
single locus with the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of starship activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a synteny plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regions of similarity are indicated in
gray over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each line is a different isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just obviously a subsample of
the isolates in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red, outlined in red, are all of the
different starships that are found at this
[SPEAKER_00]: one particular locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in different colors over here,
might be of interest to some people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, these are all different biosynthetic
gene clusters that are encoded in this one
[SPEAKER_00]: locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think is really interesting
about this example, it really shows how
[SPEAKER_00]: much variation can accumulate in just a
particular region due solely to starship
[SPEAKER_00]: transposition activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, we have starships
actually introducing a biosynthetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster to this EGC hotspot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, we have starships that are
coming in and inserting themselves within
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular cluster, like over here,
or just upstream of different clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the phenotypic
consequences of these insertion events are
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but now we actually have a hypothesis
that we can go back to the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually interrogate in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, the takeaway here is that
really nowhere is safe in the genome from
[SPEAKER_00]: starships actually being able to insert
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I also like to point out,
and I get this question a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how faithful is transposition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, I've pulled out the same
starship across a dozen or so isolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the starship is found across different
genomic locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see synteny only between
the different starship copies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not between the planking regions in
this particular plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell, the boundaries of the
starship are pretty faithfully maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: across transposition events.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some variation, some
intraspecific variation in what this
[SPEAKER_00]: starship actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that the answer to this
question of whether or not content is
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained between transposition events or
between different isolates, it's both a
[SPEAKER_00]: yes and question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is maintained, but then also these
sequences are part of the genome and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, are experiencing the same types
of mutational events that other sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: in the genome is experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are also changing over time,
although we don't really quite know if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're changing the same way or if
they're changing in slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was looking at starships across
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we wanted to understand what impact
starships might be having on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pangenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pangenome is the complete set of
genes or genetic sequences found across
[SPEAKER_00]: all individuals in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was saying within any one particular
genome, around two and a half percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic content is located on a
starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you try and scale that up to now
look at how much genetic variation is
[SPEAKER_00]: contained on starships within the
pangenome across all these isolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that around three to five percent
of all of the genes in the pangenome are
[SPEAKER_00]: found at least once on a starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, the genes that tend to
be enriched on starships, no surprise,
[SPEAKER_00]: are so-called accessory genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accessory genes are genes whose
presence and absence differs across
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals within a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upwards of 16 percent of accessory
genes are starship mobilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited about this
finding because for a long time we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really quite understand what contributed
to variation in gene presence absence
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of canonical genetic mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have some really good evidence that
it is the mobility of the starships that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be contributing to the presence
absence variation in these accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, thus generating variation in
genomic content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this, we'll get into
aspects of horizontal transfer gene gain a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit later, but something that's
important to know is that being located on
[SPEAKER_00]: a transposable element also predisposes
genes on that element to being lost
[SPEAKER_00]: because not every transposition event is
ultimately successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown in the lab that
occasionally a starship will fail to
[SPEAKER_00]: reintegrate into the genome during a
transposition event, leading to the loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of that gene, of all of the genes located
on that particular element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this way, starships are both
mediating gene gain through horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer and also gene loss through just
failed transposition events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because fumigotus is this model
organism, there's been a lot of work done
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and understand the functions of
genes involved in different host
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions within fumigotus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that became very quickly
clear was that their starships in this
[SPEAKER_00]: species carry loci, carry genes that
people have been studying for decades
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their involvement in particular
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best case of that is here with the
biofilm architecture factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular gene, BAF, is shared
across actually six or seven different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be this very strong
association between this biofilm
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture factor and mobile starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in this particular gene
because it's been shown by some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators that it is responsible for
mediating biofilm morphology, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to form biofilms, which is
important from a human health standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also more importantly, it's able to
increase and affect how this fungus grows
[SPEAKER_00]: under low hypoxic conditions, which
ultimately impact the virulence of this
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a really cool example of a
trait actually being localized to one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these mobile elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to understand how this
trait evolves, how this trait gets
[SPEAKER_00]: disseminated or spread throughout
different pathogen lineages, first step is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually realizing that it is located on a
mobile element, and that opens up some new
[SPEAKER_00]: avenues for understanding how these
phenotypes evolve over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also noticed that there are a couple of
biosynthetic gene clusters located on
[SPEAKER_00]: starships, which again gives us some
insight into how these metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes are evolving and changing over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two examples over here were actually
identified just over eight years ago by
[SPEAKER_00]: Antonis Rokas's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first to realize that these
clusters were actually found in different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the genome, depending on what
strain you looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They named this phenomenon a mobile gene
cluster, and here we're actually showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that the starships are the mechanism
that's resulted in these clusters ending
[SPEAKER_00]: up in different locations of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that paper came out,
there's been some functional work done to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate and characterize the products of
these BGCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, one of them,
the Fuma German, is involved in mediating
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal bacterial interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this molecule actually suppresses
bacterial spore germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be important from a
competitive standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to dive a little bit deeper
into exactly how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a molecule, Fumahopsid A,
which is involved in increasing thermo
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance and also tolerance to UV
stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, again, a really great
indication of how starships, how their
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes, could ultimately impact the
phenotypes of the fungi that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: studying, and how mobilization in
particular could impact the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: these phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over here, this is just kind of one
side story just to show just how many
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses and new directions this data
set has opened up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the findings of the analysis was
that starships carry not only
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme-encoding genes, but they also carry
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using some of the tools developed by
our collaborators in the Keller Lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that in many cases,
the transcription factors carried by the
[SPEAKER_00]: starships are embedded into larger gene
regulatory networks in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, I've just color-coded all of
the transcription factors found in
[SPEAKER_00]: starships as these colored diamonds over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each connection between a node in this
network is indicating a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation in gene expression between
these two different loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that these starship
transcription factors, some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: only associated with the regulation of
other genes on the starship, like in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases, you have these
starships which tend to be associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression of many other genes across
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cursor on the screen is not tracking
the cursor on your- Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these transcription factors over here
are the ones that we're finding in
[SPEAKER_00]: starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clear for everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, we're trying to use this now
as a model for understanding who is
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating who in this interaction that's
happening between the transposon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal genome at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these interactions that we're seeing,
these hypothetical interactions that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in the network, evidence that the
host is somehow controlling expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: starships?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or conversely, is it some evidence that
the transcription factors being carried as
[SPEAKER_00]: cargo are somehow manipulating other,
potentially other phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: encoded elsewhere in the fungal cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And postdoc in the lab right now is trying
to dive in, knock out some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors and try and
understand what their phenotypic impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wraps up the first section of the
talk, just looking at what these elements
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing at a population level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to shift to a more between
species approach to try and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: role of starships in actually mediating
gene transfer between different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work is a collaboration with
Andrew Urquhart and Aaron Bogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the lab work, I would say all of
the lab work was done by Andrew,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's just started up his own lab down
in Melbourne, Australia, where he's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be looking into this a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off with our interest in
starship horizontal gene transfer begins
[SPEAKER_00]: with this particular gene cluster called
the SSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the SSA cluster, which encodes a
pathway for formaldehyde degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all three of us initially became
really interested in this gene cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was found on a couple of the
starships that we were studying at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it seemed to really
exquisitely encode the complete pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: for formaldehyde degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say we were initially a little
bit confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would fungi have evolved this really
sophisticated genetic architecture for
[SPEAKER_00]: degrading formaldehyde?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say our confusion was really
just a result of our own ignorance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't quite realize how pervasive
formaldehyde is in natural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thinking that it might only be
linked to human activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, formaldehyde is produced
usually as a byproduct of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these cases, in some cases,
it's been shown that the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: formaldehyde acts as this antimicrobial
agent that can protect particularly fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: from fungal colonization or bacterial
colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this got us really interested in
understanding this cluster because
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially it could be providing adaptive
benefits to fungi that are encountering
[SPEAKER_00]: formaldehyde out in their environment,
especially a lot of fungi that are
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said we were interested in the
cluster primarily because it was found on
[SPEAKER_00]: a starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we dug into it a little bit more,
we came to realize that actually it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just found on a single starship,
but this cluster is actually shared across
[SPEAKER_00]: four very distantly related starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've aligned those starships over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in most cases, only the
formaldehyde degrading cluster,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is outlined in blue over here,
is shared among these vastly divergent
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, the cluster itself
shares relatively high nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities, certainly higher than you
would expect just given the element-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, of course, really interested
in trying to identify the process that was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for producing this particular
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a phylogenetics approach to
understand during what time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary history of these starships
did they acquire the cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we did that, we found that in
each of these cases, these starships seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to have independently acquired the cluster
from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, we have a tree of the
captain recombinase that acts as a proxy
[SPEAKER_00]: for understanding the evolution of the
element as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, we've just mapped out the
presence, absence of the various genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are found within this cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see on this tree over here,
we have these four spots within the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cluster just suddenly appears to
now be associated with a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is pretty good evidence
that this process was a process of
[SPEAKER_00]: convergent acquisition and not a process
of inheritance through vertical descent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really interesting was that
in each of the cases where the starship
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared to have acquired the formaldehyde
degrading cluster, each of these events
[SPEAKER_00]: coincides with a horizontal transfer event
between different fungal species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case over here, between four
different species, we saw evidence over
[SPEAKER_00]: here between two, here three, and here two
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each of the cases, it seems like the
convergent acquisition of this cluster is
[SPEAKER_00]: priming fungi to adapt via horizontal gene
transfer that's mediated by the starships
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just get a sense over here
from what that horizontal transfer looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like at a genetic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're comparing two species,
putative donors and putative recipients.
[SPEAKER_00]: From different fungal species,
all of these dots represent a gene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been blasted essentially from one genome
to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see for the most part,
a lot of these comparisons, the median
[SPEAKER_00]: gene identity at the nucleotide level is
just around 70% or maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here in red are all of those starship
associated genes in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many cases, these genes are showing
100% nucleotide identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across different species, much more than
you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most simple explanation in this case is
one of horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we of course wanted to understand
what effect horizontal acquisition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: starship might have on a recipient fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were lucky enough that we found one
of the very often working with genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences, the isolates are typically not
always available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this one particular case,
we were able to acquire isolates from both
[SPEAKER_00]: the donor, aspergillus, and also the
recipient, pasolomyces over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a nice collection of both
starship positive and starship negative
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that we could test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as predicted by the genotype,
by the starship genotype, the fungi that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the starship had a phenotype of
increased formaldehyde resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here we see increasing
formaldehyde concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have the different isolates,
either starship positive or starship
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really only those isolates that have
this starship with the formaldehyde
[SPEAKER_00]: degrading cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These isolates over here, positive and
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the isolates with the cluster that
actually have the predicted phenotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: increased formaldehyde resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really exciting because it
suggests that we might actually be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's one of our ultimate goals
is trying to predict the outcomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal interactions with their environment
and with hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're showing that it is actually
possible to predict, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype of the fungus based on what
its starship genotype might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to shift perspectives a
little bit, try and understand some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: broader consequences or broader context of
starship activity within fungal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I was showing you evolution from
the perspective of the starship itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how the starship is evolving over time,
here we're taking a different perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to understand evolution from
the perspective of the formaldehyde
[SPEAKER_00]: degrading cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here we have a phylogenetic tree
of one of the genes within the cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: that's acting as a proxy for understanding
evolution of the cluster as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a very interesting evolutionary
pattern playing out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there are some clades within
this tree where this formaldehyde cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to be associated with starships as
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we went into this analysis
knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other cases, we see examples where
the cluster is associated with a degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this scenario where the cargo
in the cluster becomes mobile when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired by the starship and can be shared
between different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the flip side of that is we also
see the consequences of what happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: the starship begins to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these cases, the cargo once again
becomes part of the non-mobile compartment
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by this time, it could have ended up
in a different species, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in a different genomic location in the
cases up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was really interesting because
one of the mysteries of fungal genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: has always been how do, why are we finding
genes in different places in the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we finding what look to be near
identical copies of the same gene across
[SPEAKER_00]: different species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And before, we didn't really have a
satisfying mechanism for being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what we're seeing here is that
starships do provide now a very convincing
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation for why we might be ending up
with very diverse patterns in gene
[SPEAKER_00]: location and also gene distributions,
both within species and also across
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't to say that there aren't
other genetic mechanisms that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for producing these patterns,
canonical mechanisms like recombination,
[SPEAKER_00]: either parasexual recombination or sexual
recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in this particular case,
we're just seeing just the impact that
[SPEAKER_00]: starships can have on this one particular
gene family, providing a very satisfying
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation for how this particular
cluster has ended up so widely
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed, even when all evidence of
starship associations might've been
[SPEAKER_00]: erased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, getting back to this main
question over here and just wrapping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are starships mediating fungal
interactions with their environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: with their hosts?
[SPEAKER_00]: The two stories that I've shared today,
I hope they've demonstrated that starships
[SPEAKER_00]: really are fueling variation in genome
structure and genome content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we now have very convincing
evidence, also some laboratory experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: that Andrew has been running that we
didn't have a chance to get into right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very convincing evidence that
starships are indeed a mechanism of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, try to create a model that
summarizes everything that you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: heard over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're really advocating now is a
shift in how we conceive of fungal genome
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So current theory in fungal genomics will
divide up the genome into two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have dynamic or accessory compartments
that are changing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have core compartments which
are more conserved within species and also
[SPEAKER_00]: between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing now is that actually
there is a third type of compartment and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the starship compartment,
which consists of the mobile fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really important for a number
of reasons, but fundamentally the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to transpose or the ability to be mobile
puts the genes in this compartment on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different evolutionary trajectory compared
to genes in other genomic compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because through starship
mediated movement, these genetic cargo can
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in new individuals through
horizontal transfer events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also end up at new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can end up at sites within the same
species or can ultimately lead to loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: that mobile cargo through failed
transposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, eventually it seems
like many starships can keep going for
[SPEAKER_00]: some time, but one possible outcome is
that those mobility features are lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cargo then reintegrates back into
either dynamic or accessory compartments
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometimes even into core compartments
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really by just proposing starships as
this new genomic compartment, we're hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that this can now provide more mechanistic
explanations for genome evolution across
[SPEAKER_00]: different Pozizomycotina fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the next steps really in this
process are to continue charting the
[SPEAKER_00]: starship genotype to fungal phenotype map,
trying now understand not only fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with their environment and
with hosts, but also understand how fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: are interacting with these genetic
entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are actually embedded within their
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to thank some of the folks
involved in supporting me and also
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the folks in the fungal interactions
lab, as well as some collaborators both
[SPEAKER_00]: across the US and also Europe and
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always like to mention that this
process of actually discovering starships
[SPEAKER_00]: as a feature of fungal genomes is
certainly not something I did by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really a collaborative approach
that really resulted in us being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: really rapidly move forward in our
knowledge of these elements over a period
[SPEAKER_00]: of just four years now to really try and
more quickly and effectively understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what their role is in fungal biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just highlight some of my
collaborators that have been involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently we just wrote a little
chapter in fungal genomics textbook over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, kind of documenting the timeline of
this particular discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just highlighting how processes
like openness, transparency, and data
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing really resulted in a lot of
different groups independently,
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-independently coming up with this
concept at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would encourage you to maybe take a
peek at this chapter if you're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in understanding how this process of
discovery unfolded over the past couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do specifically want to ask students
for questions first and give students
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly an opportunity to ask
questions first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also be looking for questions on
Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about what it is about the
genetic structure of these transplasmal
[SPEAKER_07]: elements that allow them to carry these
gene groups with them in a way that other
[SPEAKER_07]: transplasmal elements can't, if you know
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's going to be my answer
to probably a lot of questions today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really still don't understand how these
things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really understand how those
boundaries are maintained across different
[SPEAKER_00]: transposition events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely something we're interested in
figuring out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know there are other tyrosine
recombinase elements that don't carry
[SPEAKER_05]: around cargo genes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you make a phylogeny of all the
starship tyrosine recombinases and the
[SPEAKER_05]: tyrosine recombinases of those other
elements, do you see that they seem to
[SPEAKER_05]: have like a monophyletic origin and
there's one type of this element that can
[SPEAKER_05]: gain this ability or is it happening all
the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is actually a question we could
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, are starship tyrosine
recombinases monophyletic or have they
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared multiple times over evolutionary
history?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that question is that
they are monophyletic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this phylogenetic tree over here,
all of the at least fungal and even
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial tyrosine recombinases that we
were able to fit into this tree all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them appear external to this particular,
sorry, all of them appear external to the
[SPEAKER_00]: starship tyrosine recombinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do share one single common origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something interesting about just tyrosine
recombinases in general, some of them like
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal cryptons, for example, they don't
carry cargo, but there are other tyrosine
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinases in bacteria that are like
bacterial analogs of starships and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: called integrative and conjugative
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in those cases, those tyrosine
recombinases also appear to be capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying cargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's something particular
about a tyrosine recombinase, some
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence in protein function or
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really enjoyed your figures and
diagrams, things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question was, I was really interested
in how durable canthopreneldehyde
[SPEAKER_06]: biosynthesis pathway and how a whole
biosynthesis pathway could fit onto a
[SPEAKER_06]: transfer as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other like biosynthetic
pathways or things that you guys are
[SPEAKER_06]: pursuing now after looking at the tyrosine
recombinase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying metabolic gene clusters
for a long time, just starting in my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about it, it really
makes a lot of sense from a selection
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective that entire pathways would be
located on mobile element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, some of the earliest
hypotheses in particular put out by John
[SPEAKER_00]: Walton, he was one of the first to suggest
that maybe the actual selection to form a
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic gene cluster came from the
selection pressure to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained, to have the pathway maintained
after a transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the very beginning, there's been
this connection between horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer and the formation of metabolic
gene clusters that I think is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short answer is yes, we are really
interested in other metabolic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters that are found on Starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two that we know the products of
in Aspergillus fumigatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those, they're actually
outlined here in white over here on these
[SPEAKER_00]: different fumihopocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there's actually a lot
of other cargo that's included in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to these particular clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly there's been a lot of
interest in the fungal genomics world in
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how different clusters end
up different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they're frequently
horizontally transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can actually begin to understand a
little bit more mechanistically why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're horizontally transferred or what
conditions induce transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it related to the actual function of
the cluster itself, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, questions like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So regarding the 11 gene families that you
found Starships in, to this point,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much of that result do you think is
due to the fact that those are heavily
[SPEAKER_03]: annotated gene families or that are
particularly relevant and we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: genomic sequences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I have a lot of things to keep
track here between the cursor and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeating the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're quickly seeing how I'm very bad at
multitasking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the question is how much might bias
in our genomic databases be impacting our
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments of tyrosine recombinase
diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say so very quickly, one of the
more frustrating aspects of one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadblocks in studying these elements was
that the tyrosine recombinase itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: often poorly annotated in a lot of
automated pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step of the tool that I
developed just takes a de novo approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: just annotating them and not relying on a
priori information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say we have a really good sense
of the tyrosine recombinases themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there is still that question of
bias in the genomes that are available for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that that's certainly something
we're thinking about when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand where Starships are
found and what fungal lineages,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, yes, they're found mostly in
Pozozo mycotina, but also most fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequences are from the Pozozo
mycotina as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am going to be really interested
to see whether or not this pattern holds
[SPEAKER_00]: true as more genomes are sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say for sure is that Starships
are not in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of really great yeast
genomes, and there's just no evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: Starships in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to mostly just be in filamentous
fungi for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a sense of the mechanism by
which Starships acquire their cargo and
[SPEAKER_02]: how, like, is it usually like a single
synthetic block of genes that corresponds
[SPEAKER_02]: to a segment of like a fungal genome or
their multiple synthetic segments that
[SPEAKER_02]: touch them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is, how do Starships
acquire new cargo?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the cow get its spots,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question kind of answered here,
I think, when you start aligning Starships
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe share different parts of their
cargo with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, like between Mithridate and
Prometheus, there's evidence that maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: was some sort of intra-element
recombination event that happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly resulting in the exchange of a
larger segment of cargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, though, with selection,
if there really is just selection for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular phenotype, you might expect
other parts of that to have been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's why these see really the
only regions being shared in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: here just being really kind of restricted
to the cluster itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that Starships can nest within
each other, so that appears to be maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: one way that cargo could be exchanged
between different elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think recombination is important,
but beyond that, we really don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether their particular genetic features
associated with Starships that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: predispose them to acquiring cargo from
other parts of the genome or from other
[SPEAKER_00]: Starships as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that those types of sequences
or IS elements in bacteria exist,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we would predict that maybe something
similar is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that Starship typically have
one copy number in each genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: although you observe some have multiple
copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering, do you plan to
investigate what mechanism onto a copy
[SPEAKER_01]: number?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that affect the phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is, do we have any
plans to understand how copy number
[SPEAKER_00]: control is enforced in fungal genomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no plans to do it,
but we're really interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how that might happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's host-controlled or whether
it's through some mechanism that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: encoded on the Starship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, you might expect there would
be selection for elements that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the detrimental impact they have
on their particular host, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about host parasite or host viral
coevolution over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the evolution of a virus or
sequence that's just more able to persist
[SPEAKER_00]: within a host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if that's something similar
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I caught this right, there's a
subset of genes on the mobile elements
[SPEAKER_02]: that are core genes from the pangenoma
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering, does that tend to be a
common theme between Starships and do
[SPEAKER_02]: those genes, are any of them known to be
essential?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, is that like a mechanism of
kind of vertical stability for it
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout propagation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, in some cases,
there are core genes that are located on
[SPEAKER_00]: Starships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any evidence that their core
presence absence patterns are somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: related to an essential function?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, like any analysis and
certainly a pangenoma analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is core in one particular gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another data set could ultimately end up
to be accessory as you add more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if that's the case with this
particular genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at their functions,
we have no idea what they're doing or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they are essential or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe do we have any questions on
the Zoom?
[SPEAKER_00]: None that I can see.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's thank our speaker again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to have the student and
first off lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try again.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
