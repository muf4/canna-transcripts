[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Frank Rossi for the Cornell
Turfgrass Video Log.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see right around the
middle of June as the ET demand and
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation systems start to get
challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to see one of our important
turfgrass pests emerging here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast, the annual bluegrass weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously it's emerged a long time ago
as an adult and now we're starting to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the damage that we're facing from the
larvae eating their way out of the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: and then chewing on the crowns of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically see this around the
periphery of fairways where we have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of annual bluegrass from
compaction and those plants start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: under stress and we start to see the
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smart turfgrass managers are
actively, if they are starting to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, they're actively seeding into it
to try to mask the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we're still struggling with
trying to find ideal timings and ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: products for application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing for this particular pest but the
annual bluegrass weevil remains one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: important and difficult pests to manage
here in the northeast and the damage can
[SPEAKER_00]: be severe around the perimeter of fairways
and surrounds of putting greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me for the Cornell
Turfgrass Video Log.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
