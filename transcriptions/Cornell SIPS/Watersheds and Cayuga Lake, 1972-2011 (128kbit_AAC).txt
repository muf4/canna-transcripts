[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I think everybody's aware of the
importance of the lakes to the landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that most residents are clear that
what happens in the watersheds is
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected in what goes on in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to do today is summarize
about 40 years of my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some problems with units,
and I guess I'd better try to get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this straightened out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volume of the lake is about 10,000
million cubic meters, if that means
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of up there with national debt
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a tornado sucked all the water out of
the lake, it would take 10 to 15 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: the lake to refill.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the deepest parts, about 450 feet,
so that gives you an idea of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking about concentrations of
phosphate, which instead of one with lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of zeros, now it's a lot of zeros and a
small number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the times we talk about parts per
billion of phosphate, that's 5 times 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: the minus 6 grams per liter, or it's about
5 times 10 to the minus 3 grams per cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please note that most of the nitrate
is talked about in terms of parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, which is 1,000 times more
concentrated than phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example that we'll see later probably,
if you put a cubic meter, if you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: pallet here with a cubic meter,
by the way, it's about a cubic yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put that in the lake and dissolved
it, you'd increase the phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration by about 3 to 5 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 5 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll concentration is commonly
parts per billion, micrograms per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at what goes on in the
early spring, chlorophyll concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: increases as parts per billion,
not equal parts per billion of phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon content of the algae is sort of 50
to 100 times the chlorophyll content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, one of the things that's important
to think about is the biological activity
[SPEAKER_00]: in Cayuga Lake depends on the
photosynthesis by the algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, that energy from the
photosynthesis is an important source of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy for all of the biological activity
in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the things we're talking about,
the chlorophyll and the phosphate are
[SPEAKER_00]: measured using standard, universally
accepted methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the data is online or in two very
important theses at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of this data is mine,
but an awful lot of it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really want to do is look,
this is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inputs of streams determines phosphate in
the lake, deep lake, which determines
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate in the surface water in the
summer or spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that determines the algal
proliferation in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measure it by chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see that a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years ago, I decided to assemble the
stream and lake data from 1972 through
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1972, I'd collected about 2,000
water samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 2,000 lake samples were available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of professional interest after
I retired, and I wanted to challenge my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, this has been a good
challenge for my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1960, for a little history,
environmental quality became a major
[SPEAKER_00]: concern at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture kind of realized food
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and the environment were all
tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the late Bob Young assembled a team of
professors, sports docs, grad students,
[SPEAKER_00]: research staff, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happened to be one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that period, 1972 to 77,
it was a very, very active group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced several theses, scientific
publications, a book, a bulletin,
[SPEAKER_00]: major emphasis on the lake, stream water,
agricultural economics, animal science,
[SPEAKER_00]: manure management, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rural sociology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole theme was to integrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced a book, and these are the
project authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, integration of everything was a part
of a major purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group met for at least two hours every
second week for six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of discussions,
and everybody had to go if they got money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob Young watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he didn't take ascendance,
but he was really just an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two people here I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Ray Ozwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ray was the lake person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to start early on, OK,
so how am I going to analyze water
[SPEAKER_00]: samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is he going to analyze lake
samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the water gets in the lake,
there's not some big, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cliff or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exchanged samples between labs and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to really point that out,
because later it's going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other person I want to point out is
Keith Porter, helped edit the book and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Goyette is sitting back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed, stand up, can you?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the guy that went out on weekends
and nights and whatever and took water
[SPEAKER_00]: samples during the storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm glad to see him here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start with kind of the conclusions
from the 1977 thing, the levels of algae
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lake are determined by the
dissolved phosphorus present in the lake
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other important issue,
once you get enriched algae, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of it by just getting rid of the
phosphorus inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real question, is that consistent with
1999 to 2011?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I want to do is just throw this up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pay much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say, OK, here's the
phosphate in the spring, chlorophyll in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's surely a clear relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how did we get the
phosphate in the spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with Q Lake and its
watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map defines the source of the
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lake surface area is about 10% of
the watershed area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we adopted as our model, our model
watershed Fall Creek for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it has a mix of agricultural
and forest land uses, which is fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: typical of the rest of the watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do is look at what
happens with Fall Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to extrapolate that to the
rest of the watersheds via this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other important issue, we had USGS
flow data from 1926 to the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will turn out to be extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing, I sampled about 100 feet
above the USGS station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked over the sampling site on my way
to my office in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took a sample, I just put it in my
laboratory or did the processing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all close to my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the watershed's about 20% of the
watershed area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just a brief map of the
watershed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that there are two main branches,
Freeville.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues on north from Freeville and
then to the east, Virgil Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did other small villages and population
densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I think it's reasonable to say
that it's a pretty good representation of
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bridge at Forest Home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
Pleasant code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what's important is you see the
pathway along the edge of the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I took all the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stored my sampling tools in the
superstructure of the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where I sampled from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice it comes through there,
and it's pretty well mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice winter scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low, very low flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice and snow are accumulated in the
watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a thaw, and oh, all sorts of funny
things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how dark the water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of sediment in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very important to take
these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: From streams like that, here's another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a summer storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the USGS control
stream on a nice summer day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just some landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the agricultural land, woods in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: More agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the background buildings and
diversity of crops and more forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a view across the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The valley and again, landscapes and
woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a creek above Freevale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the abundant vegetation along the
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the little stones, flat stones that
are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These streams are pretty well stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice now that there's a stream in the
background in the middle of this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at the buffering between the
stream and the agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Lake Como at the top of the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Fall Creek before Lake Como.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, notice the buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Virgil Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I want to emphasize
here, don't worry about the nitrate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a source of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's get to the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have here is a summary from 70,
2002 to 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: The log concentration, the log of load,
which is flow times concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's the amount of substance,
or in this case, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: taken to the lake versus the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flow is always a convenient way to
summarize the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to notice, though,
really is to look at the difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: color of the sample points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black ones are 72 to 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red is 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green is 2000, 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to conclude from this is the
loading has not changed appreciably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: period 1972 to 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, statistically, I presume you might
think of a model that would enable you to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a good statistical test.
[SPEAKER_00]: My attitude is, hey, you know,
I'm not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at these, so make up your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, oh, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we'll see this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the one thing I do want to point out
here, notice the variability in loads
[SPEAKER_00]: versus one given flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think, oh, my goodness,
this is sloppy laboratory work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not sloppy laboratory work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of samples in which you
take consecutive samples within a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes of each other and take them to the
laboratory, and there's very little
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait a few hours and take another
sample, you get into that variability that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we deal with that variability?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way is look at load versus flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually you can do some mathematics of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can either use a log or a linear
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big deal is take lots of samples,
samples all seasons and years,
[SPEAKER_00]: sample storms, low flow, and everything
else, because it takes that many samples
[SPEAKER_00]: to really get what you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another way to look at the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a concentration now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the concentration per unit volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of doing with the flow,
I've done it with flow ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these different boxes are 0 to 50 cps,
50 to 99, et cetera, all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,500 to 2,000 cubic feet per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one is over 3,000 cubic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably looked at box plots before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled one little thing out and pulled
it over to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bottom of that box is at the
concentration that includes everything
[SPEAKER_00]: below that concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the samples are below that
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the median, 50%, of course,
the top of the box is 75%, and the whisker
[SPEAKER_00]: is 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a convenient way to summarize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I finally did was just do a
regression of average on average of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our equation that converts flow
in cubic feet per second to concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of soluble phosphorus in terms of per unit
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK, now we've defined the load and
the concentration for Fall Creek 1972 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we extrapolate to all the
watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: First approximation, one thing that's
pretty well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow per unit of drainage area is the same
for all watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area of Fall Creek is 20% of the total
area of the lake shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five times Fall Creek is equal to input
of all the watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you might expect the next
approximation.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to also extrapolate the load
from Fall Creek to the whole watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've developed now the loading from
watersheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we turn our attention to how to relate
this to phosphate in the lake and algal
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's two things about the lake
that are pretty important to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, and I don't think
there's any controversy about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall and winter, the lake cools,
reaches 4 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mixed thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By March, the dissolved constituents in
the lake are equal, north to south,
[SPEAKER_00]: east to west, top to bottom, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, during the summer, things are a
little different because the surface water
[SPEAKER_00]: warms up and water floats on top,
and that's where the solar radiation is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the algal begin to grow, and they
proliferate, primarily in the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we conclude that the phosphate in
the deep, cold water in the lake is an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated average of stream inputs over
months and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recall the lake deeper than 60 meters
does not mix during the summer with the
[SPEAKER_00]: warm surface, but it does in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the deep water changes slowly over
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out we have a really,
really good set of data on the deep water
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the research in the 68 to 74
by Ray Oglesby and John Barlow sampled the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake, all the depths, all the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, the lake source cooling people
have taken samples of the intake for the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake source cooling, which is deep water,
60 plus meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two things, we know what the
concentration in the lake water has been
[SPEAKER_00]: for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, there's a missing slide
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graph on the left is the concentration
in the deep water, and the x-axis is used
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice in the upper left-hand solder,
there's the 68 to 74 data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beginning 25 years later,
in 1999, the concentration has dropped to
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around four to three to four to
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gradually increases as we go
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why this large difference between 74
and 99?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about eight if you compare 99 to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go later, it's about six parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we go back to our 1972 to 77 data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't recall, probably,
the phosphate and detergent was banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was banned beginning in 1973.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time in all our
deliberations from 72 to 77 on the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of this on the phosphate in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that detergent P,
the phosphate in the detergent was a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large fraction of the total phosphate
going into the lake from sewered
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, the two together were
about a half a kilogram per cap per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by 2005, 100% of the detergent P has
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, the Lake Cornell or the
Ithaca Sewage Treatment Plant has removed
[SPEAKER_00]: on the order of probably a little more
than half of the excreted P. So if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at just the sewered population,
which of course the output from the sewer
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was going directly into the lake,
it was about 44,000 kilos per year for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the 40,000 unsewered, about 11,000
kilos of P per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the total is about 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now obviously, these are kind of broad
generalizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at that 10,000 million
cubic meters of lake water, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to about five to six parts per
billion decrease in what you would expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to find in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can document all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out about it,
you can read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, now we're back to looking at this
by difference between 99 and 2011,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is documented by the Lake Source
Cooling Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice it does go from somewhere
around five to somewhere around 10 in that
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well again, we're back to the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very large, annual puts, the
watersheds varies between 10 to 15% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you're changing the amount of
phosphate going into the lake in a given
[SPEAKER_00]: year, you're not gonna see that right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wait at least five years,
six years, two years, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've puzzled over that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the really key issues is in 1972,
the chloride in the lake had increased to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 100 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve Effler and his group noticed
that the chloride started to go down once
[SPEAKER_00]: they quit putting the fines in the lake
from the excess of mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 100 parts per million in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1976, it's gone down to about 60 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that's kind of a gradual
decrease approaching probably the current
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride steady state in the lake of
around 55 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us right off hand,
oh, okay, that lake's big and chloride has
[SPEAKER_00]: said we got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, here things get, now we start
looking at stream flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph is 1963 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green things are yearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, this is flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yearly flow data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the black line, which is five-year
rolling average and how that goes through
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes of high and low flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we say, oh, wait a minute,
how are we going to average this over
[SPEAKER_00]: years if we sort of say, hey, the amount
of flow determines the amount delivered to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's the, here's the approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first of all on the far left graph,
we've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's chloride in the lake as it
decreases over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second graph is the delivery of water
that flow into the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five-year averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is the concentration versus
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to combine those, the two
middle ones, and then we have to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do to get that, to finally see how
that impacts the phosphate in the deep
[SPEAKER_00]: lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got all of that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how many years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, here's where things get a little
messy maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, I know what the flow is for this
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentration, box plot tells me how
that concentration is distributed as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: through flow regimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 750 samples in that box plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to say, oh, we've got
that, that's good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we start our, our matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first column we list the, let me go
back, I think maybe a little clearer if we
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first column in that right now I think
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get this all tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first column we list the concentration
in the deep lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for each year, 1999 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next column is the amount of flow or
the load the preceding year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second column is the average load over
the two preceding years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third column is three years, et cetera,
et cetera, all the way out to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now here's just sort of a piece of the
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a year, Lake P, first year,
second year, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take, we look at the, we put this
into a correlation coefficient matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a little, it's a little
small, but let's say, so these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation, the second column in is the
correlation coefficient between the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate and the lake and the stream
average input for the first year,
[SPEAKER_00]: second year, third year, fourth year,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the correlation
coefficient for the first one year,
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second year, it's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third year is better still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, you get to six years,
you get a correlation coefficient of .89.
[SPEAKER_00]: My interpretation is, oh, that's the key
issue is summarize stream flow or stream
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs over six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is correlated obviously with the
phosphate in the deep lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to call your attention to the
right-hand column, which indicates the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days in that average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember the concentration,
the box plot was concentration for flow
[SPEAKER_00]: regimes, for a flow rate essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've used the USGS data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the flow is every day for how
many years you want in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about 2,000 days go into that six
year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've done a good job of getting an
unbiased sample of flow regimes based on
[SPEAKER_00]: our 750 samples, all we're doing is just
taking samples of that out and applying it
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2,000 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is pretty unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is pretty unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole problem may be biased estimate
of how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the loading of phosphate
from the stream, I think that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: unbiased estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the stream inputs averaged
over the previous six years is about the
[SPEAKER_00]: best concentration of deep water in the
lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there are about four variables that
we pick as really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is correlation matrix,
2000 to 2011, 10 degrees of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the first, the six year business,
that's the six year input from the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EFF is the deep water, measured in the
effluent from the lake source cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lake LKAPR is the measured phosphate
in the lake in April, which is part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake source cooling data.
[SPEAKER_00]: All CHL is chloride for the whole lake,
or chlorophyll for the whole lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the 1% probability correlation
coefficients 0.68.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the chlorophyll and the other
things is sort of okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, you want to call your
attention to the six year correlation with
[SPEAKER_00]: the effluent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the measured deep concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lake phosphate in April is not the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: All chloride in the summer is not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, I think those are reasonable
correlation coefficients considering this
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of 40 years of experience from
lots of different sources of samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pretty well, here's my summary of
the relationship relationships we started
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the correlation
coefficients pretty well say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: yep, that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just summary, here's SRP in the lake in
the summer versus, that's the phosphorous
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lake in the summer versus six year
average from the stream inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer chlorophyll, six year average of
stream inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously a lot of things to be
done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just four of those things kind of
put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get down to the general
summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what did we learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphate concentrations varied from
four to 15 micrograms per liter,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1974 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentration of phosphate in the spring
is correlated with the six year average of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate input from the streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophylls increased and decreased in
phase with the variation in phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of variation that's not
explained by the phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a multivariable problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely things to look at more
carefully is temperature, solar radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I looked at that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided it was beyond my
understanding ability to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the data, I thought,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one's chlorophyll conservation
has varied from four to 10 micrograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter and within the period 68 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would argue that we have covered a
lot of history of the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to look for the guide to the
future, I would say you could look at
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll concentration, but since you
go to other things, you can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: deep lake or six years or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variability, but that's
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is very,
very important, a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, or at least my scuttlebutt is,
they look at the lake and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be all that phosphorus that went
in and it's all that chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really far, far from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is there are a lot of
suspended solids that are a consequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: all those sediment, all the sediment
that's gone in with all the storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all mixed up with chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really look at chlorophyll in a
very clean lake, the lake's very clear and
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks clean, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of misinformation
and whatever about the way the lake looks
[SPEAKER_00]: is not necessarily just chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's partly chlorophyll, but very often,
if you look today, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked today, but the last two
or three days, you see a lot of stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lake, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sediment from storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spring, chlorophyll's almost zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during summer, concentration varies
widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me, it's not sloppy lab stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are real variations in a chlorophyll
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I think is very,
very important, the phosphate dissolved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water has no important influence on
the macrophytes, that is the so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, those big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually restricted to the shallow
water, less than 68 meters in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people sort of think,
oh, that must be phosphorus in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water that's influenced in the
proliferation of those macrophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some maybe, but mostly they get
their phosphate from the sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to predict future
chlorophyll and algae growth, you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the phosphate in the lake source,
cooling water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I presume Cornell will continue to
sample that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen from past history what that
deep water concentration of phosphate will
[SPEAKER_00]: do in terms of chlorophyll in the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to do all this stream
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rely on Cornell to keep monitoring
the phosphate in the effluent from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake source cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like Cornell's data,
John Halfman at Hobart William Smith has
[SPEAKER_00]: collected and published several years of
data in far more detail than the lake
[SPEAKER_00]: source cooling data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he continues his work, we need not
duplicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the future, consultants and DECR will
develop lake and watershed models by 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say there will be a TMDL,
total maximum daily load model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an opinion that currently the
quality of the lake is very good to
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the great challenge is invasive
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know how to manage them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
