[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm going to talk to you about some
ideas I've been putting together and
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to work on as part of my PhD
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of this work is linking
microbial substrate use efficiency to the
[SPEAKER_01]: formation of organo-mineral associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of these areas of research are
heavily studied by our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my goal was to ask questions trying
to link these two processes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find a nice picture to sum
all this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best I could do was a picture from
some field work recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is looking down on the soil
surface after we pulled away the OA
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see these beautiful fungal hyphae
extending at this interface between the OA
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon and the more mineral-rich B
horizon below that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I advanced this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it manually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the talk today, I'm going to do a
brief introduction on the research I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been involved with in the past and how
this research led me into questions like
[SPEAKER_01]: that now, leading into my dissertation
questions and the methods I intend to use
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to show you some
preliminary results from my first chapter
[SPEAKER_01]: and then hopefully the outcomes of all of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Anid said, before coming to Cornell,
I was fortunate enough to be involved in a
[SPEAKER_01]: land use change project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing more ecosystem scale
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of an ecosystem auditor,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at a management intensive
grazing dairy system after transitioning
[SPEAKER_01]: from a row crop agricultural management
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of digging pits taking
multiple soil samples and field recourse
[SPEAKER_01]: and watching that change in soil carbon
and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that work really led me to note the
importance of human management in
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestering soil carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was more about taking note of the
stocks and not as much about process-based
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so moving into my master's,
I wanted to ask more questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition and what processes drive
soil carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I was delving into the literature
for my master's thesis, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: papers coming out really stressing the
importance of the microbial community in
[SPEAKER_01]: this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one paper I've chosen that
really stuck out with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pulled out some back of the
envelope calculations that show that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial necromancy can be 40 times
greater than living biomass in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a graveyard out there in
some sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to 80% of soil organic carbon is
microbially derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see inferences of the importance
of microbial biomass to soil carbon and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen preservation by a whole host of
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at studies that look at
different fractions of depth or denser
[SPEAKER_01]: fractions that tend to be more mineral
associated or fractions that tend to have
[SPEAKER_01]: older ages by 14C dating, you tend to see
evidence that this carbon and nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_01]: microbially derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to have a lower C to N ratio,
a more enriched isotopic composition,
[SPEAKER_01]: which indicates processing by the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spectroscopic and biomarker
analyses also indicate that this carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: and nitrogen has been processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm telling you all this because it's
important to have a better understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: of microbial processing and understand the
preservation of soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I picked these two figures out from
the paper because they really stood out to
[SPEAKER_01]: me at the time when I was introducing
myself to the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, I believe they are German
researchers, grew some E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli up in the lab on 13C enriched
substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have enriched E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just threw that out into an
agricultural field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they followed the fate of that carbon
and nitrogen for several years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see with time, over 50% of
that dead biomass still retains in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's surprising because these are
compounds that you think would be composed
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they attribute a lot of this
preservation as others do in the field to
[SPEAKER_01]: sorption of this dead biomass to mineral
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also at this time while I'm working on
my masters, there was a conceptual
[SPEAKER_01]: framework put out that was a reiteration
of some ideas that have been floating
[SPEAKER_01]: around for a while that really changed how
we viewed the persistence of carbon and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen inputs to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your intuitive approach to the topic is
if you add stuff that decomposes slower,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should stick around longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the intuitive view of the
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a lot of authors were coming to
understand is that when you really look at
[SPEAKER_01]: longer time horizons, you see an inverse
in this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these more recalcitrant litters,
which may have higher C to N ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: though they disappear faster earlier on,
when you look at longer time horizons,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's actually less of that recalcitrant
carbon and nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea here is that this material
is used less efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at long time horizons, it's not
preserved in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to, that's a great idea and
all, but I wanted to test to see if I
[SPEAKER_01]: could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a laboratory incubation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working in these dairy systems,
there's this interesting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't tell you much about the system,
but they can really manage the age of the
[SPEAKER_01]: forage at which the dairy cows are
grazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had this idea of could you choose an
optimum forage age at which you could
[SPEAKER_01]: enhance not only carbon sequestration,
but the preservation of that material by
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I incubated a range of residue
inputs ranging in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the white circles here are showing
the Bermuda grass forage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we made fake manure from that
forage, which is lower in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you later how we made that
fake manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty interesting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I incubated that in the lab at
optimum conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we followed how much of that
carbon was remaining and how much of that
[SPEAKER_01]: was associated with mineral fractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found, if you look at the Y
axis, this is clay associated carbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there was a clear relationship
that if you add higher quality litters,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see more of that carbon associated
with the clay fraction than you do with
[SPEAKER_01]: lower quality litters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a similar trend holds for nitrogen as
well, though it's a lower magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so moving into my PhD, I wanted to
continue looking into this topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at a much finer scale and at a
molecular scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to do that, we first have to think
about what do I mean by carbon use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said it many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do that, I'm going to use a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't cringe too much, microbiology
people in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bacterial cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can imagine it in the soil
environment, it's surrounded by all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds that it might use to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of these compounds, it can't
assimilate as they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're too large to transport across the
membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depolymerization reactions are
needed to cut these larger molecules into
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller monomers or dipeptides,
smaller molecules to transport across the
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any one time, you can think these
low molecular weight compounds make up
[SPEAKER_01]: about 10% of the carbon and nitrogen in
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a very small fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can imagine also that some
microbes may not have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the extracellular enzymes to
depolymerize these larger molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, there's a small fraction
that's readily available for the microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may choose one substrate to grow
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may sequentially move through low
molecular weight substrates as it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may use several substrates
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that process, it produces more
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it respires in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these substrates are assimilated
and used to produce more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are assimilated to produce
reducing equivalents and get that proton
[SPEAKER_01]: motive force to do these reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we want to think about how
efficiently the carbon is used to make new
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass, we can simply calculate the
carbon in the microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus the amount of carbon that is moved
through the system in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount in the microbial biomass
plus the total respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the size of this red arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are some interesting
inferences we can make about how carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: use efficiency might change with
temperature or with substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also maybe most importantly with
phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my fungal cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't cringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can think of it as part of a hyphae
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to think that these fungal
organisms can use a wider range of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have more metabolic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they grow, they tend to grow more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they produce less CO2 per unit biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's carbon use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we can also think about
substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to this bacterial cell,
if we could follow just one substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe with an isotopic label, then we can
partition out how efficiently that one
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can follow the label of the carbon
from that phukos for instance into the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and into respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can calculate the substrate use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gets interesting because here
we're not looking at much at total
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really at are these compounds being
assimilated more versus dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And predicting how these compounds may be
used is an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people have thrown out different
ideas on how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one idea that seems promising is using
the nominal oxidation state of that
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of an average of the
oxidation state of all the carbons in that
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine I have NOSC on the
x-axis here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left, we have carbon at an
oxidation state of four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the most oxidized going to the
most reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, for example, versus methane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with decreasing oxidation state,
you actually have a higher heat of
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have more energy in that compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can think about where is
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on average, microbial biomass is
around negative 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's slightly more reduced than the
average sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're building biomass from
compounds that are more oxidized than you
[SPEAKER_01]: are, then your energy limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can convert that carbon into new
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second law of thermodynamics
really prevents you from using that carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: completely efficiently because you don't
have enough energy to generate enough heat
[SPEAKER_01]: to compensate for the entropy you're
losing by making new cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, if you're using carbon
sources that are more reduced,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're carbon limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have enough energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't produce that biomass as
official.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can look at where different
compounds are on this gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unsurprisingly, organic acids are more
oxidized right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the sugars and amino acids range
closer to the microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then membrane type compounds tend to
be more reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can look at some data from
microbiology literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are single isolates growing on
one carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this trend where,
as you get further away from the biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation state, you see a decrease in
carbon use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you squint your eyes, you can see
this trend approaching the average
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation state of the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe on the reduced side,
you see downward trend or no relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's looking at carbon use efficiency
with one substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we can also look at additions of
substrates to the soil matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is substrate use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tracing one compound and as many
being metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from these two papers, we can see a
similar trend in soil environments where
[SPEAKER_01]: these more oxidized compounds are used
less efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have much data on the reduced
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But perhaps that's a decrease or perhaps
there's no relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an introduction to carbon and
substrate use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I want to talk a little bit about
mineral surface sorption and the kinetics
[SPEAKER_01]: of those processes and thinking mostly
about the mineral surface as a competing
[SPEAKER_01]: repository for these compounds versus the
microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some data from a lab mate of
mine, Mike Schmidt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kinetics of sorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here, we're looking at DNA sorption
onto dirt type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the x-axis, we have time in minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the y-axis, we have Q.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is from FTIR data, but you can
think of it as the surface loading of this
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA on the dirt type surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point I want to make here is,
first of all, with increasing initial DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, so with higher
concentrations of compounds and solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get more on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone who's done sorption isotherms
realizes this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get higher loading rates with more
organic compounds and solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second point I want to make
is the kinetics of this process are a
[SPEAKER_01]: function of the saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a function of how far are you away
from saturation under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it maybe sounds a little esoteric,
but if you look at this bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: we think of this one DNA concentration
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: At time zero, you have the highest
saturation deficit possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're furthest from equilibrium as you
can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where your highest kinetics can
be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you approach that saturation point,
things slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The slope of this line decreases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, as you increase the
Q max possible at equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see those kinetics increase as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a higher Q max looking at
this green line, you have higher initial
[SPEAKER_01]: kinetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that there's a much higher
slope initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm pointing out here is that
saturation deficit really drives how well
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface can compete for these low
molecular weight molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you can try to think about,
well, when might a microbe outcompete a
microbe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the mineral surface for these
compounds it needs to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: So early on, kinetics are really high if
you have a high saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the mineral surface can
outcompete the microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already at saturation or close
to it, there's a higher chance that the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbe can outcompete the mineral surface
to get these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think early on that perhaps
metabolites might increase in importance
[SPEAKER_01]: because it can outcompete the mineral
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in these middle phases,
understanding how efficiently the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial metabolism is processing might
increase in importance because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: outcompete the mineral surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still some saturation deficit
left, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it does process that carbon
efficiently, there's still room for that
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass to be soared after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the last phase, you're able to
see that the mineral surface is already at
[SPEAKER_01]: Q max.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you metabolize the substrates
efficiently or not, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_01]: because none of it's going to stick in
simple terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think my goal moving into this work
was to devise model system experiments to
[SPEAKER_01]: tease out these different questions in
isolation and try to use those results to
[SPEAKER_01]: build up to a model soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can then ask these questions in an
actual soil environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to show you one more schematic,
I'm looking at how efficiently different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are being used, whether the clay
fraction or the biomass can outcompete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one can win this competition for
these substrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, does the saturation
deficit, so how much loading of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: material is on this clay fraction,
does that influence the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate use efficiency in determining
carbon and nitrogen loaded on the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my hypotheses, I think that nominal
oxidation state may be a useful tool to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict how efficiently these compounds
are metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the shape of that bell curve
may change depending on the phylogeny of
the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the organism we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For uptake kinetics, I think mineral
surfaces will outcompete at higher
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation deficits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they have less carbon and nitrogen
loaded on their surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, I think differences in
substrate use efficiency will only be
[SPEAKER_01]: important at middle saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about a lot of things here in the
abstract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to kind of bring
this into a real context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to build these model
systems, but I'm trying to build them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the context of a soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I chose a field site at Arnott Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Himlock hardwood dominated forest
with an inceptisol below it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earthworms haven't gotten here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pretty thick OA horizon still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a pretty shallow A,
maybe an E horizon slowly forming on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of an elliptic dominated B horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the real world context I'm
building these questions within.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is I'm in some way simulating
the pulse of a rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organic rich soil solution circulating
downward where you have this competition
[SPEAKER_01]: between mineral surfaces and the microbial
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my soil solution, I'm making a T,
if you will, from this OA horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've homogenized it so I can try to
replicate this process, shake it with
[SPEAKER_01]: water for a specified period of time,
and then I filter sequentially until it's
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made an undefined soil media to
grow microbes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I've tried to do,
it's not easy trying to define that in as
[SPEAKER_01]: many ways as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can do crude measurements of total
carbon, total nitrogen, and phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: measure reducing sugars, amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right now I'm using proton NMR
and HPLC mass spec to quantify individual
[SPEAKER_01]: cell shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as making a defined
minimal media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving from there, I need some
microbial players to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm not going to capture the
diversity of microbial species in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but you have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've isolated species from the OA
horizon and the B horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the main idea here is I'm trying
to separate for fungal versus bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a crude distinction, but once
again, I'm trying to get physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: differences and phylogenetic differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've isolated those on my soil
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried to get real players that
would hopefully respond with this
[SPEAKER_01]: percolation of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I've got an isolate library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's around 12 of these
isolates I'm currently working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really proud of those 12 isolates
till one day I was talking to Roli,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was like, I've got 56 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But several of them I know are fungal,
and several I know are likely bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have their colony morphology,
their cellular morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have some indication of where
they're using the substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the substrates I'm interested
in probing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent a simple sugar,
glucose, some organic acids, and two amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the goal here was to span that
nominal oxidation state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to choose some that are more
reduced on average versus others that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more oxidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: With formate, this is basically a CO2
ready to be expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for my model mineral phase,
I have extracted the clay fraction from
[SPEAKER_01]: this B horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an olytic-dominated clay fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have cleaned it with bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is apparently the least destructive
way to clean a clay fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've shaken it with bleach and tried to
remove as much of that surface movement as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I want to walk you through the
experimental methods I'm using to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine substrate use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing different isolates of interest
in this soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow them to exponential growth phase,
and then I can use that starter culture to
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculate my experimental flask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way I've designed this is I add
a low molecular weight cocktail with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of my substrates of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then only one is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine in this experiment,
every flask should be growing on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: trajectory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gross carbon and nitrogen dynamics
should be identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a second treatment, I would have a
different copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea here is I'm spiking at around
two times the original concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying not to change things too
drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can measure CO2 over the course
of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at stationary phase, I can filter
out the biomass and measure total biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the isotope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that allows me to measure carbon use
efficiency and substrate use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, I'm also doing uptake
kinetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm interested in what substrates
are being metabolized and in what order
[SPEAKER_01]: and at what rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same design, but there is no
label added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm destructively harvesting at
different points along the growth curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I can look at uptake from the
extracellular solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the mineral portion, I'm doing batch
kinetic studies as well as batch
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium studies, hopefully producing
data similar to that of mics that I showed
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal here is to look at the
kinetics of total carbon and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: sorption from solutions, as well as
looking at that data in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: individual compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's where I can look at competition
between microbial uptake and mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: sorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a picture of this clean clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is from the batch sorption
experiments, I can look at saturation
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior at different soil solution
concentrations at equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I can also determine for this
third experiment how to load that clay up
[SPEAKER_01]: to different saturation deficits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the final portion of this project,
the goal is to take the data from the
[SPEAKER_01]: first two experiments and see if I can
replicate that in a real soil environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm using real lucid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mixing that clay fraction,
which I will load up to different
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation deficits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with clean sands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm spiking in that soil extract
along with my isolative choice and
[SPEAKER_01]: different substrate treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal here is to see,
OK, I have two substrates that are used
[SPEAKER_01]: with vastly different efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that matter in a real soil
environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that impact the amount of carbon and
nitrogen that is retained by the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does mineral surface loading impact
that process either?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this portion, I wanted to show you
some data from the kinetic experiments
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been conducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do these experiments, I chose one
isolate of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this B1n.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just means it was isolated from
the B horizon on just soil extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a coxobacillus organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chose it simply because it produces
the most biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured it was a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to refresh your memory,
I'm growing this overnight in a starter
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and then sampling along the growth
curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm measuring carbon and nitrogen
before filtering and after filtering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that allows me to estimate carbon and
nitrogen in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the filtered solution,
which is the extracellular material,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at carbon and nitrogen,
nitrogen speciation, as well as different
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates using these methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the growth curve showing time
in hours versus optical density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like you may have learned in intro
microbiology, you can measure growth just
[SPEAKER_01]: by measuring changes in turbidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a nice growth curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't shown the fit past stationary
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll just have to take my word for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But stationary phase is around 0.2 in this
soil extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tried to hit different points of
this exponential growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone in the room who's upset,
I'm showing this as optical density 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just showing you with my different
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can easily convert that number to
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a linear relationship with total
biomass being produced, as well as carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: and nitrogen in that biomass or a more
traditional assay approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I want to talk about solution
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have nitrogen in milligrams per liter
versus time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the blue, we have total nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is outside of the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting at around 12 milligrams per
liter of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see an uptake or loss of
nitrogen from outside the cell with
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I haven't shown a mass balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no loss of nitrogen from the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this loss from solution is uptake in
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that looking at biomass
nitrogen in the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see all of that nitrogen loss from
solution is ending up in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of growth, you have about
equal amounts of nitrogen in the cell
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing surprising here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm showing loss of amino acids
as well as ammonium during growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start with, we know this microbe is
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consuming amino acids and ammonium as
it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at carbon, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at extracellular carbon in
the blue, so in milligrams per liter,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 185 to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see loss of carbon from solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as it's taken up in the biomass in
red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can calculate CO2 produced by
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also just at the crudest level,
I can see I'm losing reducing sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: This microbe is growing on sugars in the
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's where it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can then take these samples and do
proton NMR on them to try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: compound-specific information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a method that's being used
quite a lot in minimal media work,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little easier to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in medical applications or engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it with biofuel research trying
to figure out metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I have to do is I have to take
the soil extract and concentrate it
[SPEAKER_01]: 30-fold because I'm right at the detection
limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get the spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm showing chemical shift here on the
x.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intensity is arbitrary here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this data from the Cornell
chemistry unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they thought it was the worst spectrum
they'd seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal here is I can choose peaks
that are not overlapping with other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can integrate them and compare
them to a standard to quantify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real beauty of NMR is I don't
need a standard for every compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use one internal standard and
quantify any compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've shown you some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what this aromatic compound
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of sugars here,
some amino acids, organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can look at that through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, you can't see the peaks
very well here, but you can see a deep
[SPEAKER_01]: depletion in all the peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can choose individual compounds
and look at that depletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you my best example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of my glucose peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for alpha glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at the glucose molecule,
we get a proton NMR signal from this
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proton on the fine group right here,
the number two carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a doublet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, the initial soil
solution is this dark line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with time, the line gets lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see a loss of that sugar from
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can integrate this area and quantify
that out into micromoles of glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see this nice sigmoidal uptake
curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a good start, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That matches with my expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not only that, it's in the right
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like I'm probably doing this
right, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the red curve is total reducing sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's multiple sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just my glucose peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say this glucose peak is the
alpha glucose plus the beta glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where this gets even more
interesting is I can fit that sigmoidal
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake using a four point sigmoidal curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can extract a T50 value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the point at which half of that
compound is being uptaken from solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I can get a usage width.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can convert that to whatever
I'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I like to show is 90% and 10% of
the compound uptake plug in my group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example for ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pull out a T50 value and a usage
window, which here is your pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ammonium is rapidly uptaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what gets interesting is I can then
overlay that on the growth curve and start
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about in what order are
substrates being used by this microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here are some early examples from
this NMR work where I can see that baleen
[SPEAKER_01]: and threonine are being used much earlier
than glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glucose is being used later than the
average of all the sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some sugars being used
earlier than glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what gets interesting,
and this is maybe an aside from my main
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, is I'm also intrigued to think
about can we predict substrate use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency just by where it is used in the
growth curve?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at the same experiment,
I can calculate carbon use efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: shown here on the y-axis with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see an increase in cumulative
carbon use efficiency with growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this microbe by stationary phase used
the carbon with about 40% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I calculate the instant carbon use
efficiency over these intervals,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that looks somewhat like it may be
a bell curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this idea that maybe the
compounds being used right at the
[SPEAKER_01]: inflection of growth are being used most
efficiently, which gets interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because that means I should be able to
predict the substrate use efficiency just
[SPEAKER_01]: by in what order those compounds are being
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another question I'm thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving forward, I'm conducting similar
experiments for my fungal isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm conducting the isotope work right now
with the different substrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then using this data to hopefully
build up to that final model soil
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the outcomes of this work is to test
the role of phylogeny in carbon use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, test the predictive power of
nominal oxidation state for predicting
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate use efficiency, and then also
testing the impact of saturation deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: on the formation rate of these mineral
organic associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think all of that summed up is when
is microbial metabolism important for the
[SPEAKER_01]: formation of these mineral organic
associations?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, there's some hope that
this may provide some guidance to
[SPEAKER_01]: modelers.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these parameters would be directly
usable by a model, but it may give some
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance on the magnitudes of these
parameters in the relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of you are thinking that's crazy
who models at this scale, and people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a model from DOE.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're explicitly trying to build
in fungal versus more heterotrophic
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic bacteria in modeling specific
compound classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think my interest is to look at this
scale, questions at this scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to provide parameters towards
those who are thinking at this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd like to acknowledge you
guys for bearing with me and listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: these ideas, my lab group, the NMR
facility, the Buckley lab, and my funding
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would very much like to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hopefully do 16S or 18S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know physically how I would do
that yet, but that is the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you have your framework of sort of
more oxidized or more reduced compounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: and sort of your hypothesis is based,
you know, that the metabolism and the
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency is going to change the
oxidation reduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're kind of setting up the
experiment to prove that by having
[SPEAKER_04]: different substrates, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least to see, you know, see if it
matches expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you took a different approach and
tried to falsify it by doing something
[SPEAKER_04]: like having a molecule that the organisms
might have different efficiency for,
[SPEAKER_04]: but maybe the oxidation reduction doesn't
change, like glucose and cellulose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oxidation reduction is the same,
but the microbes ability to encounter that
[SPEAKER_04]: and use it is going to be dramatically
different, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you found very different carbon use
efficiency on glucose versus cellulose,
[SPEAKER_04]: would that falsify your hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it would just, let me try to
go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, oh I lost this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a good point,
and I think you see that in some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: data we already have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look closer to microbial
biomass, you see there's a bigger range,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some of those compounds that
you're mentioning, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I think, I don't think that
falsifies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're looking for a predictive
proxy that may not work in all cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm looking for a general trend of can
this be used in some kind of modeling
[SPEAKER_01]: framework, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I think it would just say that
things are not as simple as this,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have another, just another different
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So carbon use efficiency can be
problematic, and I think the issue that's
[SPEAKER_04]: problematic is the time frame at which you
assess it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you assess it in a very short
window, you're measuring long time,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you measure it in a longer window
of time, or a very long period of time,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're actually measuring is changing
quite a bit, whether it's physiology or
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions with cells, or actually
ecological interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're measuring it at a really short time
frame, which I think is really neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question was this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you had, so your expectation is
you've got these equilibrium processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're eating the substrate,
you're converting it into CO2 and biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if you violated that assumption?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if your amino acids are going
directly into protein, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going into CO2, they're not
being used to make ATP.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if the glucose is going directly into
a storage product?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to CO2, it's actually
consuming ATP, and then maybe the storage
[SPEAKER_04]: product is being used later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since your doubling time is four hours,
you're measuring these things at the scale
[SPEAKER_04]: of hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, might you be having differences
in efficiency because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cell is using these amino acids just
to make protein or to make a storage
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: How might that affect your results?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what you're describing is
trying to redo the experiment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but spiking at different points in the
growth curve?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're seeing carbon use efficiency
vary, and you're kind of saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, you know, maybe they're growing more
efficiently on this substrate versus that
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it's not that they're growing
more efficiently, it's maybe they're
[SPEAKER_04]: storing more carbon at this point than
that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about efficiency so much as it's
just these reproductive choices of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, instead of doing balanced
growth, I'm actually making more storage
[SPEAKER_04]: products at this point in the growth curve
than I am in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because you're looking at this carbon
use efficiency at a very granular measure,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it looks like, oh, the carbon
use efficiency is going up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, you just have
non-equilibrium processes happening and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know how I would... I'm
trying to think of how to probe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess in my mind, I'm trying to
simulate this pulse of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you might think,
why don't you do this in a chemostat
[SPEAKER_01]: setting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is, it's not how things tend
to work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this pulse of it, and then you
have rapid growth, because, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these substrates available all
of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some sense, that's what I'm trying
to mimic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess maybe you could test it with a
more refined medium instead of a soil
[SPEAKER_04]: extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you grow them on glucose.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grow them on glucose plus amino acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have a systematic difference
with one versus the other, then it's
[SPEAKER_04]: telling you that something's different
about how that amino acid is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is some evidence looking at
a single versus a dioxin group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if I'm understanding what you're
saying, Dan, it could be thought about
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of as a lag, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That you've got a storage pool within the
microbe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might also be able to do some other
experiments and just some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: input-output modeling, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be able to estimate the size of
that storage pool or measure it in some
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could actually answer, well,
yeah, this might be happening,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's only 5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, yeah, this could be 90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might get some idea of how important
it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of saying, instead of like this,
instead of a straight line, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you average, it looks like a
straight line.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at a really granular level,
you see it stepwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so depending on where you sample at
this point versus this point, it might be
[SPEAKER_04]: low or high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if you sample at a really coarse
scale, it gives you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at this model,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this model, they haven't even put the
minerals on the diagram to maybe show you
[SPEAKER_01]: where it is priority-wise in the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all they have are, I think it's
initialized based on the amount of clay in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just have a forward and
backward rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no modeling of sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe I was actually thinking of
your figure in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, I'm thinking about this
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even bringing in that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking, if you thought about
these as separate plates in the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you thought about competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also these other concepts
where, just because something's sore
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean a micro can't kick it off by
exuding another compound, exuding a
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate-rich compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can then desorb that compound and
allow that substrate to be utilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that mineral is totally colonized
by cells as many minerals are,
[SPEAKER_02]: does that affect the amount of things that
can be absorbed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
