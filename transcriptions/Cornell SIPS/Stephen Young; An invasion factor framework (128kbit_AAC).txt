[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tony, for that nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again for the opportunity to
come and talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Tony said, this has kind of been
something that's been ruminating,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for me, for longer than I've
known Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually like a five year going on
longer type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to dive into too much of
that right now because that's part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just again, I want to thank you for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great chance to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Tony said, we're really looking
for feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you don't have something now
today, you think something, we'd be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go ahead and get started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to just give a little
outline of what I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: today so you can kind of follow me through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a little background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before just jumping right into this,
I thought it'd be helpful if I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: how I got to where I am with this and how
we got to thinking about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least how I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about thought
process, my thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for those of you who are in
graduate school right now, you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of thoughts or maybe you're
having no thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, if you stay in this
business long enough, you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: those thoughts together and this could be
a way to kind of see that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about some time points as we
go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to hit the key research
papers where I found really underpinned
[SPEAKER_00]: this framework that I'm going to present
to you, developing the framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at our conceptual models,
testing the models, and then talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how that relates to future directions with
this framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when I get to this part,
this is really a collaborative effort
[SPEAKER_00]: between Tony and another faculty member at
Trinity Western University, David
[SPEAKER_00]: Clements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those two guys have been helpful in
this process, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, the thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking broadly, broadly thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's kind of an oxymoron,
but you just kind of ruminate on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, when we talk about thought
processes, there's one of two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize I'm probably maybe
categorizing them too narrowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm just going to talk about there's
the reduction approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking at the idea of reducing
complex interactions and entities to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sum of their constituent parts in order to
make them easier to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we break things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might work at the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might look at one species that has a
role in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's a reductionist type of thought
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the reverse of that is the
holistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Referring to a big picture mentality in
which a person recognizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: interconnectedness of various elements
that form larger systems, patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: and objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to the big picture
scale where you're looking at systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do different parts work in these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can you do both?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I wrestled with
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to talk about some of the
time points in my career about where I
[SPEAKER_00]: think my thought process has crystallized
on different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to go back to graduate
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is University of California Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Tony mentioned, I have a PhD in soil
and biogeochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone has that one course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have more than one course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have the one course that really
challenges you, makes you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: engages you in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had that one course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I had multiple courses, but this
course was soil science 105.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a field course in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was three weeks, actually more than
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went out all over California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know anything about California,
it actually has all 12 soil orders in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to see all 12 of these on
this tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see whether we were up in
the mountains in the snow, whether we were
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the desert, whether we were in a
pit in the forest areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm meditating or taking
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is definitely a meditated shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're on some pretty high elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group, you really kind of
coalesce as a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really start to exchange ideas,
thoughts, not just during this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: field presentation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the motto was no whining,
adventure, and always move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's why you should take the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think every good professor has a
reason why you should take the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here was the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what I highlight is we can
never duplicate what you will see and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their thrust was you need to get out
and experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did I do it once?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did it twice, because I just
couldn't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first time point that I
think I really was now challenged in my
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward to, as Tony
mentioned, I did a postdoc at Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where kind of the outside the
box thinking really started to
[SPEAKER_00]: materialize, where I was working at a
Center for Precision Agricultural and
[SPEAKER_00]: Automated Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So completely different from my graduate
school training.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where engineers get together and
they create these machines that do all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, well, how do we apply that
to weeds and weed management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our traditional approach is the
combination of the various methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we have technology,
and I'm not talking about biotechnology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but technology, sensors, automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can think about removing the
spatial temporal constraints and combining
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology with the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've written a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got many different authors together and
we wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this topic about the future weed
control and cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this was another kind of
galvanizing period where, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: now this is another thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I went to University of Nebraska,
assistant professor, a lot of energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about getting a
program going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard about the NSF career program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me was a golden opportunity,
at least what I thought, to really put
[SPEAKER_00]: forward an idea and take it to a level of
adding the theory and the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought were really valuable in looking at
invasive plants, the ecology, the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution, and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked into this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I should also say at that same
time, I was working on invasive plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2012, Nebraska was, in one of these
highlighted colors where extreme or
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional drought was occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about invasive plants in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, how are these things kind of working
together?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went ahead and submitted a proposal
looking at invasive plant species response
[SPEAKER_00]: to extreme weather events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a little snapshot,
the intellectual merit part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at phenotypic
characterization and genetic markers
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reproduction, invasives versus
natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at this R star model that was
first proposed by Tillman, where the most
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive species is the one with the
lowest resource requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to develop greater
understanding of how native and invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species differ in their adaptation
in these new and existing environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially where drought was occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to two grant writing workshops,
talked to the people, said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I on track?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of reviews on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came a little roadblock here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not fund, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was nothing fundamentally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, you gotta be
exceptional of the exception of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say outstanding, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless, I have looked at a lot of
different proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a list which any faculty
member I'm sure has the same list or
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, I was talking to a
colleague who's now at an administrative
[SPEAKER_00]: level and he said, you know, I've still
got boxes of proposals back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: when you had to actually write and send it
in by paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just showing you that the
thought process hadn't stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I didn't get funded,
even though it was kind of a letdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thought process didn't quit,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, everyone, for those of you coffee
aficionados, you know, here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: percolating coffee pot, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's, this is my brain, a pot of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's percolating over the stove with
all these ideas, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to starting graduate school,
you know, everything's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, are we going to get to
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the jury's still out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't, I haven't reached that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully with what you see today,
there's maybe we're getting towards this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at, let's now move into the,
where we're looking at this framework and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at what are the key research
papers, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit on three papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple papers out there on
invasion biology, but I'm going to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on three that I think really are
applicable to what I was trying to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: now what I've been working with my
colleagues, Tony and David, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this paper by Peter Albert
at UMass on invasiveness, invasibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the role of environmental stress in
the spread of non-native plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were looking at was
invasiveness of the species versus
[SPEAKER_00]: invasibility of the habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really challenging to identify
traits of invasive plants because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: different, they do different things in
different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The habitat type is a little bit,
I wouldn't say easier, but more realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: in how do we quantify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at factors and they
identified competition intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance regimes, environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into a lot of
this, but just highlight the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they focused on was the environmental
stress invasibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a little, diagram,
this is their conceptual model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between these two is this
is cases in which high stress should
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease invasibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where cases of high stress
should increase invasibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just conceptual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they were thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not based on empirical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at case, whoops, case one,
here we are, high stress will kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-native.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case two, the non-natives are
competitively inferior at maximum stress
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then case three, the non-natives are
slightly competitive at superior,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly more superior at high stress
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the other, where we have
increased invasibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case one is non-natives are competitively
inferior at low stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where there's low stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the case five, non-natives are
competitively superior at all stress
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I'm going to jump to this paper by
Facon et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at invasion success
affected by factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're hearing this factor term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to remember that because we're
going to hit on that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at, their focus was this
migration factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When does something invade, or when does
it first come into the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at ecological and
evolutionary changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came up with some invasion
scenarios showing how the factors
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to invader and habitat match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a diagram from their paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just walk you through this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's on the x-axis here, sorry,
y-axis characteristics of the invaded
[SPEAKER_00]: areas and of the invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis we have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the invaded area, that's this diagram,
is dotted line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The invasive species is the solid line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The migration, so when it's introduced,
is the arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the invasion process starts
is the vertical line on the time axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have four scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first one is only a change in the
migration regime is needed to initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invasion begins after change in the
invaded area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the invaded area,
something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at this point, the invasion
process actually starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flip that around, looking at the
invader, now there's something going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at this point, the invasion
actually starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally at the scenario D where
they had a change in migration and invaded
[SPEAKER_00]: area needed to initiate the invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they talk about several examples
about where this could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last paper is one by Jessica
Girvich at Stony Brook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she and her colleagues are looking at
kind of synthesizing where we are with
[SPEAKER_00]: biological invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of this big picture look at
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they came up with this conceptual
synthetic invasion meta framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real tongue twister, but they just
simplify it to SIM, where the unifying
[SPEAKER_00]: principles of ecology in evolutionary
biology And really what they were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to focus on was this demography of
invasions, where they occur, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these three characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to touch on this a little
bit because those are kind of fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: for our framework, where it's looking at
rapid local population increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures or local dominance,
and range expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they looked at the literature,
kind of summarized the different models
[SPEAKER_00]: that were out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up with their model to help
kind of push us along with quantifying and
[SPEAKER_00]: testing the evaluation of these causal
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture cartoon of their
figure, where they've shown that the SIM
[SPEAKER_00]: can be applied to this simple case of
enemy escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in this invasion theory, where the
invader demography then relates to this
[SPEAKER_00]: population interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going through this affects these
different invasion components.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flip it around a little bit,
where it's applied now to the example of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological and evolutionary components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is related to propagula pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have basically looking at
human impacts and how they're related to
[SPEAKER_00]: this process, which relates to invader
demography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, affecting these two
different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this is where they apply
it to the evolution of increased
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive ability, where that theory is
the invasive plant is released from its
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints in the new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they apply their model to how this
scenario might work out and how it would
[SPEAKER_00]: affect, again, this rapid population
increase and dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dominant monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so like I said, those are three
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some examples of really
some kind of primary or really key papers
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been published on this kind of
modeling, looking at how do we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the theory of invasibility, whether this
paper by Davis, Catford et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: did a nice study on looking at invasion
ecology and a theoretical framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out this one by
Ibanez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a nice paper integrating assessment
of biological invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just plants, but really looking
across the wider context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are papers that could be looked
at as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I want to talk a little bit about
what we did as far as developing our
[SPEAKER_00]: framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting used to this
paper thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so Kohler and Lodge is a paper that
talks about looking at the establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So invasive plants established in going
through this kind of scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to understand that a
lot of invasive plants, they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced, but they don't always
establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they did was kind of describe
this in a way of where these points of
[SPEAKER_00]: failure could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a species that's entrained in the
transport pathway, whether it's brought
[SPEAKER_00]: over an ocean, whether it's transported
across a region, oftentimes there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure in the transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, if it survives the transport in an
adduction, it fails to establish Maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions aren't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a disturbance factor that's
limiting that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does establish, sometimes it still
remains noninvasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see weeds, invasive plants that do
establish, but they're not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't reach this final stage where
they're spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they become invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I've read a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the ballpark is 10% of plants
actually become invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that we have, that's 10% of
all the ones that have been introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's this kind of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then for what we were looking at,
again, I'm going to go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: components that Gurevich et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we really focused on this
framework in the context of these three
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rapid population increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where populations increase
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether that's starting from a single
plant or multiple plants, there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also an established local dominance,
so where there's monocultures that are
[SPEAKER_00]: created with limited or no diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can occur at, again, scales of
small, local to large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we get to range expansion where
there's a dispersal from local populations
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in these transition or
disturbance zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of this invasion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if these stages don't always occur
chronologically, they might occur
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, that's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the stages that are included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, the goal that we had was really
we're not trying to predict how and where
[SPEAKER_00]: invasions will occur, which a lot of
models do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, we were using these three
main factors of resident community,
[SPEAKER_00]: the invader fitness, and weather to guide
and develop our understanding of why
[SPEAKER_00]: invasions occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three main factors that we've
kind of included in our framework is the
[SPEAKER_00]: resident community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some things that are part of
the resident community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the micro and macro fauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nutrients, soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different parts of the
resident community that are factoring into
[SPEAKER_00]: the invasion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is probably simplified to
some degree, but it's a starting point of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invader fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the invasive species respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things such as the plastic
elasticity of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's able to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the genetic selection of the
plants that are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they fit to adapt to the new
environment or the new habitat that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're introduced to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the weather factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been really important,
especially as we see these new extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions occur, but not just extreme
high and lows, also the normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30-year averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just averages, but frequency and
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: How frequent are these events occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the duration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the effects of different,
in this case, CO2 concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even other gases, other
weather-related factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this kind of invasion framework
where we've got these components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The factors are contributing to the
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we were going to do,
now what we did was we went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and looked for empirical
research that would help us to build our
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptual model to show exactly how
resident community, invader fitness,
[SPEAKER_00]: and weather influence the invasion
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified three invasive plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chose these based on their kind of
well-known, where they're distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: across the regions or across the country,
at least as far as in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at the number of
published empirical studies for each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the number of papers that
were identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are empirical studies with
data that we could use to evaluate as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as their contribution to these different
factors and ultimately to this invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: factor framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose yellow star thistle,
non-native common reed must thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually also have worked with these
plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of a bias there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is we've identified these
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we hope to do when we get done is
you could substitute any invasive plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species and run that through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this model to see what
the outcome is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the top line of one of the
tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for yellow star thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the reference paper by Brown and
Rice in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the resident community
factor, the four things that we've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: grouped these into as far as did this
paper address one of these subcategories
[SPEAKER_00]: in the factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked for if there were other
things related to resident plant community
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to these other four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we did was assess what was
the invasion component that was affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to quantify was it most
affecting the rapid population increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: local dominance, or range expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this paper, we were able to assess
it as rapid population increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at Phragmites, same thing,
resident community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I should also note the remaining
papers were categorized into this table as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the two others, invader fitness
and weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a total of nine tables that we
categorized the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to show all those tables
right now because it would put you to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just get through this a
little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a paper by Song et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these were the summarizing what
were the things that they looked at under
[SPEAKER_00]: these different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is where we assessed what
was the invasion component affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally for must thistle,
actually a lot of work has been done on
[SPEAKER_00]: must thistle by a person at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really done a nice job of looking at all
the different factors of must thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of some of her work
with a graduate student looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also look at pasture grasses in
old fields and how there was competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assessed that as establishing local
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at our tables, we then took
this information from the invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: component that was affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used it in this conceptual model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to go to looking at how
we're testing this conceptual model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to summarize the empirical
studies on our three example invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species to contextualize our
invasion factor framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using this what was the invasion
component affected from the category and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is looking at the
influences of the component in limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: the invasion success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the weather factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's for our three species,
must thistle, phragmites, and yellow star
[SPEAKER_00]: thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then along the x-axis, we have rapid
population increase, increased local
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance, rapid range expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from our framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the components of invasion
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what we can see, this is very
kind of generalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at our example invasive
species, extreme weather, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: limits invasion success primarily by
affecting the rapid range expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out here, we see that this was most
limiting to these three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can say different things about this
established local dominance and rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: population increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously, they're not all at the
same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And star thistle was affected across all
the different components of the invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really interesting is the
current predictive models would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've seen, what we summarized
empirically from empirical studies doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily match up with what's being
predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the interesting
things that we found out with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for this weather factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I'm not going to go
through all the different figures right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to kind of bring this back and
show where we're at with this by looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at these recent conceptual models broadly
synthesized concepts and theory to test
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses, improve understanding,
and identify research directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the reductionist approach is focused
on things like fluctuating resource
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, invader and resident
community, introduced native ranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these current future climate
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our invasion factor framework combines
the factors affecting the invasion process
[SPEAKER_00]: and synthesizes it into a framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to bring both of these
together to better understand for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular invasive species why that's
been occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump really quickly in
here to future directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about, so I've thought back to
my thought process that I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would this guide research?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to be focused on research,
what would this do for a research program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if a person was looking at
individual invasive plant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there enough empirical studies on the
factor to be able to make an assessment of
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some species, maybe there are
adequate number of empirical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just been studied to death,
but the lack of synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not been synthesized to say,
this is where this weakness is,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this is where it's been a real critical
area that we have now been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand with the research that's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also an approach for targeting specific
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know something specific,
maybe it's a resident plant community
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's an invader fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something to do with weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you target management to really
address that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the thing that's really fun
is to address invasion theories and really
[SPEAKER_00]: push that to see, where are we going to go
with this thought process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I kind of alluded to this model
congruence, where we've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: empirically based conceptual models,
and then we've got data driven projection
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bethany Bradley at University of
Massachusetts has done a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of predicting different scenarios,
different situations with invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we bring these two together with
either companion studies, verification
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, some way to say the projection is
actually reflecting what the empirical
[SPEAKER_00]: research is showing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I want to end with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quote from her paper,
their paper in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uncertainty is associated with changes
in climate vegetation communities and the
[SPEAKER_00]: response of invasive plant species warrant
an urgent need for integrating modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: and experimental work to better address
the ecological ramifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that really, in a way,
summarizes, at least for this weather
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a lot of other things that
we can say, maybe similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we bring those two together to
really move this along?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank my
co-authors, again, Tony DiTomasso and
[SPEAKER_00]: David Clements, Department of Biology at
Trinity Western University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's any questions, thoughts,
comments, I think we have some time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
