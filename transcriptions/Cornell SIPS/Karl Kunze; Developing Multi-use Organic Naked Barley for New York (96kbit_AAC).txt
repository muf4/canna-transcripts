[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be talking about
developing a little bit about developing
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-use naked barley for New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm first going to focus on what naked
barley is, what are its potential uses in
[SPEAKER_00]: a future market, some of the challenges of
naked organic barley, and I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of focus on some results so
far in terms of wheat competitive ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's time, I will show you some
of the protein and yield data from the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is naked barley?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply barley without the hull,
and so what that means is when barley is
[SPEAKER_00]: thrushed, when harvested, the hull falls
off, similar fashion to wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to malting barley where the
hull remains on the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples right here are Copeland full
pint, which are hulled barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then buck, which is hullless or naked,
in which the hull falls off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene for hullless barley is
characterized by the NUD gene on on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 7HL.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recessive in its loss of function
single point mutation, and so in theory
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite easy to breed out of after a
couple of selfing generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some modifiers which
make it a little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make truly naked sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big advantage of hullless barley or
naked barley compared to hulled barley is
[SPEAKER_00]: that without the hull, you don't have to
pearl it, and it can be useful for food
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to determine the potential for
naked multi-use organic barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're kind of basing our potential success
off these two movements, or sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: increased markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being the craft brewing
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Dan mentioned in seminar last Tuesday,
there's been an increased movement for
[SPEAKER_00]: using naked malted barley, particularly in
New York on the New York Farm Brewery Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: has incentivized local brewers and
molesters to source their ingredients from
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and combined with the organic grain
market, which there's been an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: demand for novelty food grains,
and with previous work of value-added
[SPEAKER_00]: grains with Mark, Lisa, and Lisa Kissing
Cusack, and June Russell have been really
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in developing a market for
organic grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully with the combination of the
malting and brewing movement and the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grains, we can replicate the
success with multi-use organic barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the potential benefits
specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I previously mentioned, the
characteristic of No Hall is its main
[SPEAKER_00]: selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health benefits such as beta-glucan and
protein levels compared to wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mainly we're really focused as an
alternative crop for organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these characteristics that
we hope that organic farmers can sell to
[SPEAKER_00]: are malting, and if malting doesn't work,
we can do food, and if food doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can go for the feed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the feed market can be a bit
dismal, but perhaps with organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a better market compared to
the conventional counterpart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately with naked barley,
there's a lot of challenges, and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start with the agronomic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have to worry about yield
with barley, winter kill for the winters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to worry about
environmental factors, that barley is
[SPEAKER_00]: highly sensitive to, disease resistance,
scald and powdery mildew for the winters,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf rust, and spot blotch for the
springs, and of course, physarium head
[SPEAKER_00]: bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For malting and food, we have to worry
about aesthetic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the barley going to be marketable?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you have a purple barley,
that's going to be definitely more
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable than, say, a conventional white
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein and beta-glucan and more
specifically within the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-glucan, your food barleys will
probably, you might want your food barleys
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a higher level and malting to have
a bit lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, in New York,
we have the pre-harvest sprouting issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really a problem this year,
where the grain germinates in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we want to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, with disease resistance,
we're concerned about the don being part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the organic-specific
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: With yield, you have different management
concerning the grain, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and whatnot, certified
organic plant, what nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: available for that, disease resistance,
you have limited amount of fungicides that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use, and for some seed-borne
diseases, there is currently no solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, weed compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so put all these traits together,
you have quite a bit to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we hope to make gains in all
of these, making idealized gains in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these won't necessarily be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, for what I'm going to be
talking about here, I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on these three traits,
protein, weed compatibility, and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the project, these are the three
main approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the marketing, the market,
market the grain as something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: should buy, which is kind of putting the
cart in front of the horse a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: with this breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education, we have a barley composite
central local middle school, so they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about aspects of barley,
or any genetic concepts the teacher might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk to them about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the research component,
which is what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have both a diversity panel,
and a regional panel, our regional trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about the diversity
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we did get some good data on
height, head-to-date disease, but due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the inclement weather, short amount of
time, and it being a diversity panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed phenotypes were not that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about that for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, regional trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the regional field design,
and management, our entries included some
[SPEAKER_00]: release varieties, including buck and
streaker that we've grown out for Grow New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City already, some hauled checks,
selections from Oregon State based on
[SPEAKER_00]: previous diversity panels they've
conducted, and breeding efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some naked lines that have been grown
here for the past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the field design, for these trials,
we had 25 entries for the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 for the summer, 20 for the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one is three replicates, randomized
complete block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: For locations for the winters,
we had only one location at Freeville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the springs, we had two locations
for the springs, one also at Freeville,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one at Musgrave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in regards to management practices
relevant to these phenotypes, we did do
[SPEAKER_00]: tine weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I would like, as much as we
might be able to get a better weed percent
[SPEAKER_00]: management without tine weeding,
breeding for weed competitive ability is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to complement organic practices,
not replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, organic fertilizer rates
are going to affect yield and protein
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for weed competitive ability,
attempting to find what characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: are related to yield are quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easily confound with environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things such as previous year rotation of
what crop was there before it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just random factors that result in weed
seed dispersal make this a very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much what I've done is trying to
do like a shotgun approach and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: certain more barley traits and weed
measurements to see how well, if any of
[SPEAKER_00]: them correlate to yield, and we can use
them as evidence of an entry having a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher weed competitive ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these traits that I phenotyped
included stand counts in October,
[SPEAKER_00]: November 2017, early vigor, where one is
like the plant's not even there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nine, the plant completely fills out
the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In May and June, I did weed barley
percentages, and I measured that by using
[SPEAKER_00]: this PVC 0.5 meter squared plot by
throwing in a random section, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how much, what percent within that
plot is either barley, weeds, or neither,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it would be ground, and then did that
twice for each plot, and then did it for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them, and then recorded plant form
where one is prostrate, so the barley
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads out and five is erect,
and recorded these values for the weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: barley plant form three times every two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were the weed results of the
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the winter regional, this bar graph
showcases the varieties that had the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest differentiation for weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of the weeds,
unfortunately there wasn't a lot of weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in winter, or at least they weren't very
correlated with yield, most likely due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry weather conditions, or it could be
that all these barley varieties may have
[SPEAKER_00]: some effect in weed suppression,
but between barleys and other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, we haven't grown those yet,
so it would be hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were some of the correlations for
these traits that I measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, plant form and percent weeds
wasn't very highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley, not surprisingly, if more barley
given in the plot, it's going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand counts in vigor had some
correlation, but nothing too promising,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's important to keep in mind this is
only the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only the first year, and so more,
we're going to need to do this over
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple years to get multiple weather
conditions, or weather conditions that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be more desirable for weeds to grow
and maybe not so much for barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see whether these weeds or barley will
truly out-compete the weeds as in a trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same thing for the springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locations at Freeville and Musgrave did
same traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I did add is that I
did weed counts when I did the weed barley
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages as a proxy to see,
well, maybe if we account for the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds or the size of the weeds,
maybe that will have a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation, and I recorded those three
times every two weeks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that was even worse due to
the drought, due to severely localized
[SPEAKER_00]: drought in Musgrave, and the fact that
these were planted very late on May 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't many weeds in the first place
because even weeds don't like dry weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of ground space as well because the
barleys had a hard time growing in this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, so unfortunately we weren't
able to get much weed measurement data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these valleys of barley, again,
are highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, some of the weed
measurements were more highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's really hard to say whether
it was the barley that suppressed them or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was more rather they filled in the
void of the barley just not growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Freeville, we had a little better
success, a little better weed pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: than Musgrave for the winter location,
but even then with the drought on
[SPEAKER_00]: the weather conditions still impeded the
growth of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at some of these correlations,
again, our two highest ones were barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for this one it was a bigger rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, for this trait,
it'll probably be better to measure barley
[SPEAKER_00]: at certain stages of plant where barley is
more highly correlated if we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether these can grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either that or we're going to have to do a
better job of accounting for the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we would have to do more of an
experiment where we would have to seed the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground with a certain population of weeds
that are relevant to that stage in
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are questions I would hope to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For overall yield performance of the
winters, they did quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the statistical model I used to
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Response is yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't put any fixed effects in as any
of the fixed effects tried had no
[SPEAKER_00]: significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The random effect was with entry,
models as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the error variance, you did a
row-column spatial correction where the
[SPEAKER_00]: diagonals represent the error for each
plot and the off-diagonals represent the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated errors between the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, these yields did quite well,
but it's important to consider that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is only the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are not specialty-selected
two-row malting, so a lot of the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant can be focused more on the
grain yield as opposed to other traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would select for the malting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a contribution to why these
are a bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these are for the springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that was different is that
I added a fixed effect for location.
[SPEAKER_00]: As expected, these did not do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs had a very hard time this year
with unfavorable weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even between the dismal conditions at
Musgrave and Freeville being marginally
[SPEAKER_00]: better, the distribution of these scores
was still quite narrow, so the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly played an effect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a 20-gram phenotype protein,
took a 20-gram sample from each plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: samples analyzed using a FOSS NIR system
using least squares regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending if the barley was a hallless or
a hulled check, they're calibrated on
[SPEAKER_00]: separate files because hull calibration
files do not help calibrate hullless ones
[SPEAKER_00]: or naked ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: For overall protein performance on the
same model, use the same models yield only
[SPEAKER_00]: with responsive protein instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall for the winters, they did quite
well in terms of our desired range for
[SPEAKER_00]: what it should be for protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is only one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll still need to evaluate these across
better years to get a better picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: how these will respond in terms of protein
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not phenotype for beta-glucan yet,
but that should be another factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: determining whether these might have some
potential mole quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the springs, these also didn't do well
in that regard either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same model as the previous one except
adding fixed effect location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the weather, protein values tend to
be much higher in barley when there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water or there's a lot of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully next year we'll have a better
accurate depiction of these spring barleys
[SPEAKER_00]: with better weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future plans in terms of multi-use organic
barley with the genomic data of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to combine with the phenotypes,
have some potential information for some
[SPEAKER_00]: genome-wide association studies,
and perhaps examine different methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring the rate of growth of barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I acknowledge and thank my
community members, Mark, Gary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sam Alcane on the entire soils lab
group, funding sources, the ANIC lab
[SPEAKER_00]: group, and semantics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a general naked barley
picture that was not germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for putting that one up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not relevant to the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Directly take a plot sample from the plots
after they're harvested and weighed of
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I didn't put that data in here,
but I did take note of which ones they
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to account for that, I did take kind
of the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I have been taking notes on what
kind of weeds are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to do a seeding experiment on
those are the weeds that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, it's a lot of lambs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the winters, you have to worry about
penbit and chickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the springs, you have to worry
about pigweed and land quarters more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you mean to use a flat correlation for
the errors between plots or was that
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be an AR1?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was supposed to be an AR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
