[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as class mentioned, my lab is
interested in understanding how organelles
[SPEAKER_07]: talk to each other, how they move
membranes and proteins, how communicate
[SPEAKER_07]: within plant cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today I'm going to be telling you
about a project that involves endosomal
[SPEAKER_07]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so endosomes traffic protein from the
plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they decide pretty much if they will
go back to the plasma membrane it will be
[SPEAKER_07]: sorted for degradation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to give you an idea about how
massive this trafficking pathway can be in
[SPEAKER_07]: fibrocytes, in animal cells, they can
change completely the composition of the
[SPEAKER_07]: plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single protein in 16 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that thousands of vesicles
are being buried from the plasma membrane
[SPEAKER_07]: carrying these proteins to the interior of
the cell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thousands of exocytic vesicles will go
back to restore the proteins that have
[SPEAKER_07]: been removed without changing surface area
and volume.
[SPEAKER_07]: And asking why a cell would decide to do
that, I'd like to show some drastic
[SPEAKER_07]: examples.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how pretty much a cell would
change to decide completely to change the
[SPEAKER_07]: way that be sent to other cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that happens during cell
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_07]: A cell is becoming something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is responding to a change in the ionic
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has to change the composition of
transporters and channels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is responding to some kind of insult,
a pathogen or so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So although endocytosis and endosomal
trafficking happens at very nominal levels
[SPEAKER_07]: all the time, there are conditions where
the changes are very, very drastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once these proteins at the plasma
membrane are targeted to go through the
[SPEAKER_07]: endocytic pathway, usually what happens is
that if this is a plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is a cytoplasm, they become
ubiquitinated as a main signal for
[SPEAKER_07]: internalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are sorted into vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The most common type are clathrin-coated
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from there, from those vesicles,
they move to endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, if they lose their
ubiquitin, they can recycle back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, they are recognized by a
number of proteins called escort protein
[SPEAKER_07]: for endosomal sorting complex required for
transport.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the escort proteins will recognize the
ubiquitin, bind the cargo, and deform the
[SPEAKER_07]: membrane in such a way that they will sort
the ubiquitinated proteins into vesicles
[SPEAKER_07]: inside the endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the whole endosome fuses with the
vacuole or lysosomes, you were talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about animal cells, those vesicles with
their cargo can be degraded.
[SPEAKER_07]: In some other cases, this is mostly being
reported in animal cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: These organelles can also fuse with the
plasma membrane and release internal
[SPEAKER_07]: vesicles to the extracellular space.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the escort proteins were actually
described as complexes in endosomal
[SPEAKER_07]: trafficking by Scott Emmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since then, a lot of progress has been
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been almost 20 years since the
escort proteins were described.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of information now is available.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are highly conserved.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are also present in plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what we have been focusing on
in my lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the escort proteins are not present,
so the vesicles may not form, the cargo is
[SPEAKER_07]: not sequestered into those inner
compartments, and then the plasma membrane
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins will end up in the vacuole
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if these are receptors, it means that
they are still exposed to the cytoplasm,
[SPEAKER_07]: so they may continue signaling If these
are channels or transporters, they may be
[SPEAKER_07]: active still.
[SPEAKER_07]: So usually, for an organism not being able
to do this process properly will result in
[SPEAKER_07]: death.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the core escort proteins are missing,
at least multicellular organisms are not
[SPEAKER_07]: able to survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So going into more detail, I just
mentioned escort in general, but there are
[SPEAKER_07]: multiple escort complexes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now, if this is a surface of the
endosome, we have our ubiquitinated cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one to be recruited is Escort 0.
[SPEAKER_07]: It combines ubiquitin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It combines phospholipids in the endosomal
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: It brings Escort 1.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all multi-subunit complexes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Escort 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as Escort 2 is recruited,
some bending is reported in the membrane,
[SPEAKER_07]: so they can have some membrane bending
remodeling activity.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, the membrane starts to deform
even more when Escort 3 is recruited from
[SPEAKER_07]: the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Escort 3 is formed by multiple
subunits, and they tend to form filaments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just a cartoon, because
although a lot of work has been done on
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding how these complexes
associate with the membrane and deform the
[SPEAKER_07]: membrane, we don't know that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, very cartoonish.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we kind of envision what is
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point, and thanks to the activity
of Escort 3, the membrane will buckle,
[SPEAKER_07]: containing the cargo proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a neck, where most of the
escort proteins are localized.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least, that's what we think.
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point, the ubiquitin is removed
from the proteins, recycled back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: A last complex is recruited.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the key components is called SKD1
implants, VPS4 in yeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: All these escort proteins have multiple
names, depending on the organism.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just following here the plant
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are more familiar with the
yeast or animal nomenclature, it would be
[SPEAKER_07]: VPS4.
[SPEAKER_07]: And lip 5 is a cofactor, BTA1 in yeast,
and it helps this protein to be recruited.
[SPEAKER_07]: SKD1 is an ATPase.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a big chaperon that binds Escort
3.
[SPEAKER_07]: By hydrolyzing ATP, it gets the energy to
change the conformation of Escort 3,
[SPEAKER_07]: recycle all the escorts back to the
cytoplasm, and finally, the vesicle is
[SPEAKER_07]: released into the lumen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a very complex process just to
form a vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's highly conserved across all
living cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as we can understand, it's the only
machinery that is able to buy vesicles
[SPEAKER_07]: away from the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to tell you about two
stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, what we have learned about the
action of the different Escort components,
[SPEAKER_07]: Escort 3 mostly, in membrane remodeling
and protein cargo sequestration in
[SPEAKER_07]: vesicles in plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Claes mentioned, we have been also
working on the role of Escort proteins in
[SPEAKER_07]: the degradation of chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So going back to these tiny vesicles,
and when I say tiny, they are tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're below 40 nanometers in diameter,
so way below their resolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are very hard to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we compare one of these endosomal
vesicles to, for example, a
[SPEAKER_07]: clathrin-coated vesicle, how they form is
very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, they are budding away from
the cytoplasm, not budding into the
[SPEAKER_07]: cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the opposite topology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for clathrin, we may have the coat
assembling on the convex side,
[SPEAKER_07]: on the cytoplasmic side.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here, everything is happening from the
neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a lumen.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the lumen of the endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no coat proteins on this side.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other big difference is that when we
study, when we look more closely how
[SPEAKER_07]: clathrin is recognizing the cargo,
we still have shown that you have
[SPEAKER_07]: clathrin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clathrin is interacting with adaptor
protein that then bind the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this physical association between
clathrin and the cargo remains during the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole process of vesicle formation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clathrin doesn't let go the cargo at any
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so until the vesicle is released,
this physical association is not lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there isn't really no easy way for this
cargo protein to escape, to diffuse back
[SPEAKER_07]: to the plasma membrane while the vesicles
are forming.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a different case.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I mentioned, the escorts see the
ubiquitin on the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ubiquitin is lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's released before the vesicle closes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this point, for example,
if there is no ubiquitin, there is nothing
[SPEAKER_07]: really preventing this cargo protein to
diffuse back to this surface of the
[SPEAKER_07]: endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could be really bad, because also
there is no retrieval mechanism to bring
[SPEAKER_07]: them back.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will escape to the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be re-ubiquitinated and sent
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if these are receptors telling the
cell to divide or to differentiate,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's why it's crucial that this system
works very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, we lead to cell lethality.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a cryo-electron micrograph of
escorts 3, filaments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was done in collaboration with
John Odia and Paul Orquist, mostly,
[SPEAKER_07]: at the UW campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is one of these escort 3 proteins
expressing bacteria and then purified,
[SPEAKER_07]: put in a microscope directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how they look.
[SPEAKER_07]: They form spirals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are pseudo-colored.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were in pink when we saw them for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're pseudo-colored spirals,
double spirals, intertwined.
[SPEAKER_07]: They form single spirals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just one subunit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called SNP7 in yeast and plants,
GIN4 in mammal, PPA32 in C.
[SPEAKER_07]: elegans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same component.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the many subunits that form these
filaments, but the most abundant one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't know exactly how it works,
but it thinks that these spirals are very
[SPEAKER_07]: important in buckling and forming those
vesicle buds at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to the cartoons, this is how we
try to picture what is going on close to
[SPEAKER_07]: the time that the vesicles will close.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cargo proteins may still be
ubiquitinated, interacting with some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the escorts.
[SPEAKER_07]: The escort 3 filaments, just like the one
that I showed you, are spiraling up here
[SPEAKER_07]: in the neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: SKD1-alip-5, the triple ATPase,
or BPS4 is what you call it, will be
[SPEAKER_07]: recruited to this site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what today I'm going to be talking to
you is a lot about this stage,
[SPEAKER_07]: what we know and what is preventing these
cargo proteins from escaping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be mentioning two escort 3
subunits.
[SPEAKER_07]: SNP7 is the one that I showed you,
the cryo-EM image.
[SPEAKER_07]: GIN1 is another component of the escort 3
machinery.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will present also to you the lip 5
mutant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So lip 5 is an activator of this ATPase
complex.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it doesn't cause a lethal
phenotype, but it's important for the
[SPEAKER_07]: disassembly of the escort proteins before
they are released.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so based on working yeast,
all these proteins will be recycled back
[SPEAKER_07]: to the cytoplasm before the vesicle closes
completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants lacking lip 5, the co-activator of
BPS4, they are more or less normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: For escort standards, this is a very
healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are slightly smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are highly sensitive to stress and
drought.
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, they are OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we notice is that the roots don't
respond to gravity very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we check more closely what was
going on in the roots, we notice that many
[SPEAKER_07]: of the pin proteins, so these are oxyn
efflux carriers, they facilitate the
[SPEAKER_07]: export of oxyn from cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are important for polar transport
of oxyn.
[SPEAKER_07]: In wild type, for example, pin 2 is
localized to the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are cortical cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in lip 5, we see a very strong signal
from the vacular membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you remember that's kind of the typical
features of an escort mutant.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another protein, pin 3,
another oxyn efflux carrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, wild type, mostly at the plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: In lip 5, heavy localization and
mislocalization to the vacular membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it says correlated.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's causing this effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the plant is quite happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We check more closely what was going on at
the multibesicular body level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in wild type situation, you would
expect the cargo proteins, in this case,
[SPEAKER_07]: the pin proteins, to be sorted in the
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in an escort mutant, several scenarios
are possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the vesicles don't form at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there are fewer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe they form normally.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't contain the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we did is to process cells for
electron microscopy, for transmission
[SPEAKER_07]: electron microscopy, and use GFP
antibodies to detect the localization of
[SPEAKER_07]: pin 2 GFP in wild type and lip 5.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these two set of pictures are the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the gold particles here have been
colored in red for easier visualization.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so in both cases, what we find is that
there are intraluminal vesicles both in
[SPEAKER_07]: wild type and lip 5.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we detect the GFP from pin 2 GFP on
the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are sequestering the cargo in
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we check the number, we see a
reduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the number of intraluminal
vesicles on endosomes per cross section.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a significant decrease in lip
5.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be the situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another escort 3 subunit, chin 1.
[SPEAKER_07]: Arabidopsis have two gene copies.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we get a double mutant, it's lethal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see the effects at the embryo at
the seedling level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the gene mutants are usually a big ball
of cells compared to wild type,
[SPEAKER_07]: to the stage that in wild type,
the first two embryo leaves, the
[SPEAKER_07]: cotyledons, are differentiated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chin 1 is unable to establish a polar
axis.
[SPEAKER_07]: In some cases, some seed will succeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get very abnormal embryos with an
unusual number of cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see four here instead of two that
you expect in wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those seeds can germinate to form
these very sad seedlings with multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't grow much farther than this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they die.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how far chin can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we check at the embryo level the
localization of the pin proteins that we
[SPEAKER_07]: know that are escort cargo proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pin 1.
[SPEAKER_07]: Driven by the endogenous promoter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we have used FM464 just to stain
the plasma membrane and see the boundaries
[SPEAKER_07]: of the cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a young embryo, a control
embryo.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first two embryo leaves, the
cotyledons, are forming up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see pin 1 being expressed in the
apical domain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's polarly localized on those cells.
[SPEAKER_07]: In chin 1, this is one of those poorly
differentiated embryos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pin 1 is expressed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, a strong mislocalization to the
vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: So quite similar to lip 5.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here we have a very extreme lethal
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in lip 5, it was a minor defect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So checking at the structural level,
what is wrong with these multibasicler
[SPEAKER_07]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we are immunolocalizing here pin 1 GFP
in control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be the wild type expressing
pin 1 GFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the double chin 1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_07]: In wild type, we can see a very heavy
labeling on the endosomal intraluminal
[SPEAKER_07]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pin is properly sorted.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the mutant, although there are
vesicles, there are fewer vesicles,
[SPEAKER_07]: the pin protein can only be detected on
the limiting membrane not inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have done this for hundreds of
multibasicler bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have been unable to detect any
signal from the intraluminal vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So although the structure of the endosomes
looks similar between lip 5 and chin 1,
[SPEAKER_07]: there is a big difference here.
[SPEAKER_07]: These vesicles are not sorting the cargo
into the lumen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were wondering why would that be?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is chin 1 doing that is not trapping
the cargo in the vesicles?
[SPEAKER_07]: So one possibility that we thought is that
if chin is part of this structure,
[SPEAKER_07]: if chin is part of the filaments,
maybe by missing chin there is a delay on
[SPEAKER_07]: the closure of the neck, of the release of
the neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that the cargo has to be sorted
in the first place because otherwise the
[SPEAKER_07]: vesicles don't form.
[SPEAKER_07]: And chin is a very late acting component.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most likely the pin proteins were
there, but somehow they escaped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they escape, it could be because
there was a delay in closing the necks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I mentioned, once the ubiquitin is
removed from the cargo proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: they eventually will escape and diffuse
back to the limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a delay here, it could be responsible
for the phenotype that we are looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just ask a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, how long does it take to form one of
these vesicles?
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, the endosomes are moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're quite dynamic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vesicles are tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no data on how fast these
vesicles form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided to simulate and see how long
would it take for cargo proteins to escape
[SPEAKER_07]: so we can estimate how fast the process
should take place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a computational simulation,
basically what we want to do is to have
[SPEAKER_07]: pin proteins located in the vesicle,
let them diffuse, and just measure how
[SPEAKER_07]: long would that take.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for that, we needed to know the
diffusion coefficient of pin proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: the vesicle bud geometry, exactly how big
and how big the neck and all that,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then how many pin molecules we can
actually feed in a vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to do that, first we calculated the
diffusion coefficient of pin proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is TIRF, Total Internal Reflection
Fluorescent Microscopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are plant cells without a cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can image the plasma membrane
directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't do that on endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the perfect system to
measure diffusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because the endosomes are so small and
they are always moving, it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_07]: have them in focus.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided as a proxy to measure the
diffusion of pin particles on the plasma
[SPEAKER_07]: membrane without a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so pin here is stuck to a
photoconvertible fluorescent protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we shine UV light to these
particles, the fluorescent goes from green
[SPEAKER_07]: to red.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can activate a few particles and
measure their displacement.
[SPEAKER_07]: We get all these trajectories.
[SPEAKER_07]: And based on that, we can calculate the
diffusion coefficient.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the result was that these particles are
moving 0.06 square microns per second.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it in another way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are also protoplasts now
expressing pin to fuse to GFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we did here was fluorescent
recovery after photobleaching.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just photobleached one region of the
plasma membrane and then measured the
[SPEAKER_07]: recovery of the fluorescent, assuming that
most of it is coming from lateral
[SPEAKER_07]: diffusion from other sectors of the plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: We plotted those times.
[SPEAKER_07]: And based on this, we calculated a second
diffusion coefficient in 0.17 square
[SPEAKER_07]: microns.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is much faster than the previous
one calculated by TIRF, but it's a normal
[SPEAKER_07]: discrepancy when people measure diffusion
based on these two techniques.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're within the range of diffusion
coefficients for other plasma membrane
[SPEAKER_07]: protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided to keep both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then by doing electron tomography,
so that's when you take a sample,
[SPEAKER_07]: a TEM section to a spatial microscope that
can tilt the grid to 60 and minus 60
[SPEAKER_07]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: You collect images every one degree,
and then you can do a reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to the concept of medical
tomography.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by doing that, you can get 3D
information, a relatively hard resolution
[SPEAKER_07]: for your organelle understudy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we did that for the endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we found some tomograms that capture
vesiculation events.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the limiting membrane,
and this is a body profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: So vesicle that is forming.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then we segment the vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: The neck, the limiting membrane,
and this is the result.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the geometry of one of those
little buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it for many.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next question was,
how many PIN molecules can you fit there?
[SPEAKER_07]: So PIN proteins have 10 transmembrane
domains.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how big a transmembrane domain is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do an estimation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we estimated that a PIN protein would
occupy more or less 17 square nanometers
[SPEAKER_07]: on a membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And knowing how big these vesicles are,
because we have all the dimensions from
[SPEAKER_07]: the tomograms, we decided that we were
going to take this green area farther away
[SPEAKER_07]: from the limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this area, you can fit around 40
PIN proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of assumptions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we know how fast the particles
move.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know exactly how a vesicle looks like
or a forming vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we estimated that we could fit there
40 PIN proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other consideration was volume
exclusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's another factor that we introduced
in the simulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to illustrate what it means
with this Verizon ad.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are Verizon users.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's assume that these are PIN
proteins that have become deubiquitinated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they are free to diffuse,
and they go to the neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a few will escape, and then there will
be this crowding effect, and they will
[SPEAKER_07]: collide with each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all that can be simulated, because
these particles have a volume.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can predict how they will behave
during the diffusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, we also know that for bulky
transmembrane proteins, when they move
[SPEAKER_07]: through very narrow membrane tubes like
the one in the neck, there will be a
[SPEAKER_07]: retardation.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't move as fast as in a flat
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for proteins similar in structure for
PIN and for necks, again, this is 17
[SPEAKER_07]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have been measured for tubes around
20 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The retardation factor in the diffusion is
around 5-4.
[SPEAKER_07]: So every time that one of our particles
got into the neck, instead of moving at
[SPEAKER_07]: the diffusion coefficient that I showed
you before, we make them move slower by 5x
[SPEAKER_07]: factor.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and this is a simulation in action.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was done by Tatiana Marquez and
Ray Layers, two mathematicians in the
[SPEAKER_07]: University of Alabama.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we are starting with 40 particles
on the bottom of the vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as soon as they escape to the limiting
membrane, we decide that they are gone,
[SPEAKER_07]: because the limiting membrane is so big
that the chances that they will reenter
[SPEAKER_07]: the vesicle just randomly is very low.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this graph shows the number of initial
particles, 40, and over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So according to the two diffusion
coefficients that we calculated,
[SPEAKER_07]: the fastest and the slower one,
for the fastest one, 50% of the PIN2
[SPEAKER_07]: particles would be lost and gone from the
vesicle in seven milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the other diffusion coefficient
value, it would take 18 milliseconds to
[SPEAKER_07]: lose half of the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we saw this number, we said,
what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, until you know how long it
takes for the vesicle to form,
[SPEAKER_07]: this doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fastest vesiculation process ever
recorded in nature is ultrafast
[SPEAKER_07]: endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that takes between 100 and 150
milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
several seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the S-core proteins, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't seem to be extremely efficient
in mediating membrane fission.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, if they don't do it extremely
fast, they could be losing their cargo
[SPEAKER_07]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided that something wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to show you now one of the
tomograms that we use.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these big dots here in northern,
these are gold particles that we place on
[SPEAKER_07]: the surface just to guide the
reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to show you the tomogram.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we are going to go through the
volume.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a plant endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you focus your attention to this
region, you will see vesicles coming up in
[SPEAKER_07]: plane.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are moving through the volume.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that you notice is that they are
all connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not forming individually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's going to play back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these two are connected, connected to
this one, connected to these two,
[SPEAKER_07]: connected to this, and to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't seem to form one by one.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are all somehow connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are forming a network.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we do the segmentation of
these tomograms, this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are clusters of vesicles forming in
networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few cases where we have individual
budding events.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even fewer cases where we have free
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll show you the quantifications in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this is now what has been reported
in yeast where the process was first
[SPEAKER_07]: started.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went and did tomography in yeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is one tomographic slide through a
yeast MBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vesicles here don't seem to be
obviously connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: We found some cases where they could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's only 6%.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very low percentage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing close to almost 70% or 75% that we
see in plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems to be a different between at
least yeast, plants, and we haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: checked other organisms yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do they form?
[SPEAKER_07]: These networks, how do they get
established?
[SPEAKER_07]: So also by doing tomography, we were able
to show there is a first indentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a shallow depression on the surface of
the limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: One vesicle bud formed with a neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another shallow depression
happens on top of the already formed
[SPEAKER_07]: vesicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we have two vesicles connected
through a bridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another deformation in bed on
top.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it looks like this is how it
happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have one vesicle, and then another one
forms on top, and another one forms on
[SPEAKER_07]: top.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is no membrane fission going on,
and they remain all connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the diameter of these bridges is
exactly the same as the neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we check the escort mutants that I
showed you before by electron tomography.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a lot of vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just placed some red balls inside to see
where the vesicles are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lip 5 and Chim 1, the two mutants that we
discussed before, have a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_07]: number of intraluminal vesicles,
but also they are not connected to each
[SPEAKER_07]: other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some cases in Chim, this is
tomographic slide, there are these very
[SPEAKER_07]: unusual long necks connected to multiple
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is something about the timing of
vesicle formation and the neck and the
[SPEAKER_07]: release of a new vesicle forming.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the quantifications.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this graph is showing the number of
vesicles per cubic micron of endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a higher density of vesicles
in wild type compared to the two mutants.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is showing us the number of vesicles
engaged in these networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many more vesicles are connected in
average in wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is showing the percentage of
vesicles in different conformations.
[SPEAKER_07]: So blue bars show the vesicles that are
connected to each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: The red ones are the free vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this would be the single butt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can see, huge decrease in the
number of vesicles connected to each other
[SPEAKER_07]: in the network and an increase in these
cases for the escort mutants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like we need at least escort 3
and lip 5 in order to have an efficient
[SPEAKER_07]: production of vesicles and vesicle
concatenation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the value of having vesicles
concatenated?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that affect the efficiency of the
organelles to trap cargo?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we did is now run the same
simulation that I showed you before by
[SPEAKER_07]: using these other geometries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So two vesicles or three vesicles
connected are now placing the 40 particles
[SPEAKER_07]: in the position farthest away from the
limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm showing you here only for one
diffusion coefficient value.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can see, you remember the 7
milliseconds for one single vesicle in
[SPEAKER_07]: red.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second line here, two vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: From this position, 20 particles will
escape in 38.
[SPEAKER_07]: Milliseconds in average.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from this position, it will take 76
milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a delay, but still it's not
very impressive considering that still we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to get closer to the second range to
wait for one of these vesicles to form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we predicted that it has to be some
additional barrier happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: The geometry of the membrane is not enough
to explain how these organelles are able
[SPEAKER_07]: to trap the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you remember that I mentioned at the
beginning, it is assumed that the escorts
[SPEAKER_07]: are completely recycled back to the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't get trapped in the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't get sequestered into the
endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we see these very narrow necks
connecting the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one possibility is that the escorts
are stabilizing those bridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, they should be
trapped inside the endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we developed an antibody against SNP7,
again, the most abundant subunit in the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can see signals from the vesicles
inside the endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if that's the case, and the escorts get
trapped in the bridges, and maybe they are
[SPEAKER_07]: playing the role of being a diffusion
barrier, that means that they need to stay
[SPEAKER_07]: there until the very end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because otherwise, the cargo proteins
could escape in a few milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the prediction was that if they are
there, stabilizing the network,
[SPEAKER_07]: they will get delivered to the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are being consumed as the endosomes
sort cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's not what it has been shown
before in other organisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to prove that, we isolated vacuoles
from protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a SNP7, the escort 3 component.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a cytoplasmic protein that we just
use to check that our vacuole preps are
[SPEAKER_07]: clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a pyrophosphatase that is
present in the vacuole membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that wild type, it has a SNP7
in the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's being delivered to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lip 5, and this is very consistent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a SNP7 in the vacuole, but much
less.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a correlation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you remember that lip 5 have fewer
vesicles, and they weren't concatenated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the more efficient these sorting seem
to be, the more SNP7 is being degraded in
[SPEAKER_07]: the process, or being sent to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is just a control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So SNP7 is an autophagy mutant that is
unable to take protein from the cytoplasm
[SPEAKER_07]: to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can still see that SNP7 is sorted
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Protease protection assay, if we add
proteases to our macular preps,
[SPEAKER_07]: only if we add tritonate detergent,
we can degrade SNP7.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that SNP7 is protected
inside the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being delivered together with the
endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our conclusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just what I mentioned to you,
the intraluminal vesicles implants form in
[SPEAKER_07]: networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Escort 3 is necessary for the formation of
those networks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we believe that the escort components
that get trapped inside are important for
[SPEAKER_07]: stabilizing those breaches, and they may
be acting as diffusion barriers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the short story for the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Degradation of chloroplast by autophagy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the connection to the escorts?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the gene mutant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember the one that cannot sorpene
into the intraluminal vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The chloroplast, this is autofluorescent
from chloroplast, are all connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is one epidermal cell.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the chloroplast moving by
cytoplasmic streaming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just like a bunch of grapes
all moving together.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are all physically connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't know what to think about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not obviously connected to endosomal
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we introduced some additional markers
to understand what was the effect causing
[SPEAKER_07]: this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: So ChIP1 is an envelope plastic protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a GFP fusion introducing
wild-type and ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the long extensions,
the long connections, keeping plastic
[SPEAKER_07]: together in ChIM through the envelope.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Reg A GFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this protein is targeted to the stroma
of the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wild-type, as you can see, some short
extensions, normal ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here in ChIM, you can see continuity
of the stroma from one chloroplast to the
[SPEAKER_07]: next to the next.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in some cases, all the chloroplast in
one cell are physically connected with
[SPEAKER_07]: each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to understand what was going on and
what was causing this phenotype,
[SPEAKER_07]: we check in more detail one protein that
is involved in plastic division.
[SPEAKER_07]: This connectivity between plastic is
common in mutants that are not able to
[SPEAKER_07]: divide their chloroplast properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they try to divide them, but they fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they get connected through these
long bridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you probably remember chloroplast and
mitochondria divide by fission.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the case of the chloroplast,
there is an outer and an inner ring of
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins that help to constrict the
organelle and split it in two.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the proteins in the inner ring,
in the stroma ring, is called FTSZ2.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you label this protein in wild-type,
you usually see one ring.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be this situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the ChIM mutant, the chloroplasts
have multiple rings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cases in complete rings, abnormal
rings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cases, they are all over the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we check the abundance of this protein
in wild-type and ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is our cytoplasmic loading
control.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that we are loading much less
protein extract here from ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: And still, there is a lot more of FTSZ2 in
ChIM1 than in wild-type.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this by itself could just tell us why
the plastics are unable to divide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you overexpress this protein in
Arabidopsis, you get this kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So an excess of FTSZ will lead to a
chloroplast division defect, and
[SPEAKER_07]: chloroplast will be connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now why an endosomal protein is having
this issue?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why there is more FTSZ2?
[SPEAKER_07]: In ChIM1.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another feature that we noticed
in ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only the long connections between
plastics, but you can see here for the
[SPEAKER_07]: stroma marker, and for another envelope
marker, MEX1YFP, expressing wild-type and
[SPEAKER_07]: ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: So wild-type and ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that there are some
GFP-positive vesicles coming from the
[SPEAKER_07]: chloroplasts in ChIM, not in wild-type.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same thing with MEX1.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of tiny compartments, like dots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is the quantification.
[SPEAKER_07]: There can be more than 20 of these little
vesicles per cell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And rarely you see any of those in
wild-type.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are those?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, chloroplasts produce vesicles
usually in cases where they are being
[SPEAKER_07]: degraded as part of their turnover
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many different pathways.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many different vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, the ones that fit the size
of what we are seeing in ChIM would be
[SPEAKER_07]: these three.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of them depend on the autophagy
machinery, and some others don't depend on
[SPEAKER_07]: any molecular mechanism controlling the
autophagy pathway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the CV vesicles and the ATI1 bodies
both contain thylakoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rubiscose-containing bodies,
these are small vesicles that bud from
[SPEAKER_07]: these extensions called stromules that
were discovered by Maureen Hanson here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the stromules bud of
rubiscose-containing bodies, and they are
[SPEAKER_07]: somehow sequestered into autophagic
membranes labeled with ATG8.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a typical protein that characterizes
autophagic transport.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again, multiple reasons why we may
be seeing vesicles in ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, these two have thylakoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are exporting thylakoid to the
vacuole for degradation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rubiscose-containing bodies do not
have thylakoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we check all the proteins that were,
chloroplastic proteins that were
[SPEAKER_07]: misregulated in ChIM, so these are
Westerblots, wild-type ChIM, wild-type
[SPEAKER_07]: ChIM, wild-type ChIM, next one,
inner envelope, highly-increasing ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray-K, stroma, highly-increasing ChIM.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thylakoid protein D1, we notice
normal levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one wasn't affected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another set of proteins, these are all
endogenous proteins, tick 110,
[SPEAKER_07]: inner envelope, TOX7, TOX75.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are all more abundant in ChIM than in
wild-type, but the thylakoid proteins are
[SPEAKER_07]: not affected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's affecting outer, inner envelope
proteins and stroma, but not thylakoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just as a control, transcripts are not
the explanation because they are not
[SPEAKER_07]: upregulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's at the protein level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only example that I showed you
before of a vesicle being transformed by
[SPEAKER_07]: plastic and containing only stroma and
envelopes are the rubisco-containing
[SPEAKER_07]: bodies that battle from the stromials.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we think that they are trapped by
these ATG8-positive autophagic membranes
[SPEAKER_07]: and delivered to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any role for ChIM in here?
[SPEAKER_07]: We decided to check how this happened and
see if that's where ChIM is acting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is mCherry, a fluorescent protein
attached to ATG8.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray-K GSP in a wild-type plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that ATG8 becomes associated
with some domains, some extensions on the
[SPEAKER_07]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see that multiple times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this seems to be an stage that is
intermediate between this and that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why we have to check it is
because it has been based on a speculation
[SPEAKER_07]: based on some microscopy data,
but we don't know exactly how this
[SPEAKER_07]: happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other data from wild-type.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can see ATG8 positive coats
associated with chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see how as they are forming the
stromials extensions, the ATG coat is
[SPEAKER_07]: following along.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this other case, it's a short movie.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's GSP-ATG8 and chlorophyll
autofluorescence.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have one plastic here, one plastic
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very quickly, I'm going to show you how
the ATG8 coat in green is following the
[SPEAKER_07]: extension of the stromials.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is an association of the
autophagic machinery with the stromials.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is going on in CHIM?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they able to do this normally?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the same construct GSP-ATG8 in
CHIM1.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a very high increase in the
number of structures decorated with ATG8
[SPEAKER_07]: that are not fully associated with
chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are open.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not forming the closed structure
of the autophagosome that should trap the
[SPEAKER_07]: rubisco-containing body.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see in these multiple cases also
by M, abnormal membranes close to
[SPEAKER_07]: plastics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, by detecting these markers,
we know that these are autophagic
[SPEAKER_07]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the autophagosomes, these structures
with ATG8 around, close vesicles,
[SPEAKER_07]: deliver the rubisco-containing bodies to
the vacuole for degradation, you would
[SPEAKER_07]: expect to see inside membranes with ATG8
and the rubisco-containing bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually, when they are delivered to the
vacuole, they get degraded very quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can block the degradation using a
drug called concanamycin A.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we use concanamycin A in plants
expressing GSP-ATG8, we also remove
[SPEAKER_07]: nitrogen so they feel hungry and they
start to degrade more plastics and other
[SPEAKER_07]: organelles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the wild type, you see very little
GSP-ATG8, some dots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we treat them with
concanamycin A, you can see all these
[SPEAKER_07]: autophagic bodies, these structures inside
the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vacuole will be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: In gene 1, we see a very similar response.
[SPEAKER_07]: So autophagic membranes are delivered to
the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when this is the same with RKGFP,
so this is a stromal marker, we are trying
[SPEAKER_07]: now to see the cargo what was inside that
autophagosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we treat them with concanamycin A in
the wild type, a lot of autophagic bodies
[SPEAKER_07]: inside the vacuole, so they have been
successfully delivered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we are seeing this content inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the autophagic mutants that are not
able to do this process, they are failing
[SPEAKER_07]: to form autophagosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see rubisco-containing bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a control.
[SPEAKER_07]: And gene 1 only has a few.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has tons of autophagic membrane
inside, but it doesn't have the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so to validate this by some other
method, we did Westerblad.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you again, GSP-ATG8 and
RKGFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: When these proteins are delivered to the
vacuole, the GSP gets cleaved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very resilient to the proteases
in the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see the GSP fragment once it
has been released to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are six days, all seedlings,
12 days, all seedlings control,
[SPEAKER_07]: our autophagy control, and then chim.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did it at two different stages just
because the chim seedlings are so poorly
[SPEAKER_07]: developed that you don't know what is a
good control.
[SPEAKER_07]: With nitrogen and without nitrogen to
promote autophagy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the control, let's just look at
here, for example, there is GSP-ATG8.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a cytoplasmic version of the
protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we remove nitrogen, we increase
the amount of free GSP.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one that is being cleaved in
the vacuole, delivered to the vacuole by
[SPEAKER_07]: autophagy.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the ATG7 mutant, there is no GSP being
delivered to the vacuole, as expected.
[SPEAKER_07]: In chim, we have tons of GSP from GSP-ATG8
delivered to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we do the same for RK,
we see the release of GSP in control
[SPEAKER_07]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the same samples here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see it for the control.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see it for ATG7, but we don't see
it for chim1 either.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, corroborating what we saw by
microscopy, the autophagic membranes are
[SPEAKER_07]: delivered, but they don't have the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our model.
[SPEAKER_07]: Autophagic membranes will remove these
rubico-containing bodies from the
[SPEAKER_07]: stromules.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will close and deliver the autophagic
bodies plus the content from the
[SPEAKER_07]: chloroplast for degradation in the
vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in chim, they don't close properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we see so many open figures,
not completely closed autophagosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably in that time, the cargo,
the rubico-containing bodies, are released
[SPEAKER_07]: to the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we see an accumulation in the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So finally, those autophagic membranes may
be delivered to the vacuole, but most of
[SPEAKER_07]: them are empty.
[SPEAKER_07]: So chim would be involved in the closure
of the autophagosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that makes sense in terms of the
topology.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to the formation of one
of those vesicles that I showed you
[SPEAKER_07]: before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are all people who have been
involved in different aspects of the
[SPEAKER_07]: project.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly Rafael and Janice have been doing
tomography.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huy and Guy are working with the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christoph did all the work with the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are our collaborators.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we measured the diameter,
and we didn't notice any significant
[SPEAKER_07]: difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have some mutants that affect the
sizes of the intraluminal vesicles,
[SPEAKER_07]: but not the lip-5 mutation of the chim-1
mutation.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the vesicle size is different in
different cell types, at least in plants
[SPEAKER_07]: we have checked in epidermal cells,
cortical cells, meristematic cells,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they are all very, very irregular,
37 nanometers in diameter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite surprising to me that in the
chim-1 mutation you can still see
[SPEAKER_01]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that due to autophagy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other question is, you see those
vesicles, they get connected together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could that be due to the vesicles get
ILVs, they fuse together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see larger size of ILVs in that
phase?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so regarding your first question,
the vesicles do form, and it has been also
[SPEAKER_07]: observing some in mutants, similar mutants
in other organisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, if we are missing some of the core
subunit, probably like SNF7, you may not
[SPEAKER_07]: see vesicles, but chim-1 is an accessory
S-Corp3 protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we think that it can move
along the pathway.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's fusion or not, we don't have any
reason to believe that it's fusion is hard
[SPEAKER_07]: to explain fusion inside the endosomes,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you fuse vesicles in the endosome?
[SPEAKER_07]: The snares are on the other side.
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you mediate that process?
[SPEAKER_07]: And because of the intermediates that we
see, that we see single invagination
[SPEAKER_07]: events followed by another depression,
we think that that's the most logical.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are right, these are still images,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to put them in the dynamics
of how they form.
[SPEAKER_07]: But based on the structural evidence,
we think that is the order of how they
[SPEAKER_07]: form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the situation we have, the phagosome
is sort of wrapping around this part of
[SPEAKER_03]: like a straw mule in order to carry it
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be super well formed,
but the trafficking, like the motor
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins involved, if there's overlap with
like, is it like myosin or kinase?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then moving the phagosome versus
what's pulling out the straw mule,
[SPEAKER_03]: like is there an overlap in terms of
what's making this movement happen and
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually getting into the back door?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's a fascinating area,
just because we know so little how the
[SPEAKER_07]: straw mules form.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's even from the inside, from the
outside, straw mules can form in vitro,
[SPEAKER_07]: but in the presence of cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's unclear how much of the
cytoplasmic machinery they need to form
[SPEAKER_07]: these extensions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people have reported that you need
actin and you need the endoplasmic
[SPEAKER_07]: reticulum to associate with the straw
mules in order to produce long extensions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we know is that in the autophagy
mutants, that I didn't show you the data,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you have an ATG7 mutant, one of these
mutants that don't form autophagosomes,
[SPEAKER_07]: the rubicle-containing bodies don't get
released at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some information about the autophagy
machinery is also needed to release the
[SPEAKER_07]: rubicle-containing bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you end up having is just like a
rosary of rubicle-containing bodies along
[SPEAKER_07]: the straw mules, but they don't get
released.
[SPEAKER_07]: How the autophagy machinery would mediate
that, it's hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have any mechanical enzyme that
will really lead to membrane incision.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's something that we are seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: How these rubicle-containing bodies of
autophagosomes are moved to the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Implants seem to be mediated by actin.
[SPEAKER_07]: In mammalian cells, they seem to be
mediated by microtubules.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, for these particular
organelles, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that you see SNF7 inside
interluminal vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked at other upstream escorts
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they also internalized?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the following question is,
how do they get back to the recycle bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we try SNF7 because it's by far the
most abundant escort component in the
[SPEAKER_07]: code.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have antibodies against.
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot tag the escort 3.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are dominant negative.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has to be an antibody against a
native protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have tried some other antibodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: The proteins are very unstable.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are hard to detect even in
protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are not certain because the starting
levels are so low.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: SNF7 is very stable and very abundant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are now developing antibodies
against escort 2 and escort 1,
[SPEAKER_07]: also to see how many upstream components
get in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Regarding your question, about if they get
recycled, we don't think that they get
[SPEAKER_07]: recycled.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that they get sent to the vacuole
and degraded.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we think that that's a trade-off
because if they were fully recycled,
[SPEAKER_07]: then it would be hard to understand what
would be the diffusion barrier operating
[SPEAKER_07]: at those next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because based on what we understand,
the geometry is not enough to prevent the
[SPEAKER_07]: escape of the cargo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something has to remain there until the
very end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we think that maybe they
are being kept inside the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So continuing on with that, so these
concatenated vesicles inside the endosome,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is your model for delivery to the
lysosome and how those will then be
[SPEAKER_05]: degraded?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can that process be reversed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they are all concatenated,
we still need vesicle release,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they wouldn't be released to the
lumen of the lysosome or the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are fully connected to the
limiting membrane, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your question.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do think that they are eventually
released, maybe not one by one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see some networks that are not
connected to the limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see some isolated vesicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see in the distribution that they were
vesicles not connected to anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So during maturation, we believe that they
get released from the limiting membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has to be a requirement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, they couldn't be fully
degraded.
[SPEAKER_07]: They would be part of the baccalaureate
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because, again, we don't have the
dynamics, and it's very, very hard to
[SPEAKER_07]: know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have more than 50 tomograms of
different multi-basical bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: But how early or how late they are,
it's very hard to estimate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for now, it's our assumption that they
are released based on the structures that
[SPEAKER_07]: we see.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when exactly, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan?
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the concatenated vesicles,
do you know or think that reassembly of
[SPEAKER_05]: each stage of the ester complex,
do you need to still form one,
[SPEAKER_05]: two, three in order to get the new budding
in on top of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does the vesicle already being there
sort of facility the formation of the new
[SPEAKER_05]: vesicle?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those cartoons sometimes are
misleading, because we know that X-Core
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero can start operating at the plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have the idea that the X-Cores are
all kind of waiting to find the endosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, the association with the
ubiquitinated cargo can start much
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we think that they move with the cargo
through the endosomal pathway.
[SPEAKER_07]: The late components, yes, they are
recruited at the multi-basicular
[SPEAKER_07]: endosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to assume that everything is in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for recruiting X-Core 3,
you need X-Core 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: For having X-Core 2, you need X-Core 1.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of this sequential
recruitment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the other X-Core should be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you think about it, when you have
this big congregation of cargo and X-Core,
[SPEAKER_07]: then things can happen very fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the X-Core 3 are being recruited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Multiple vesicles are forming in the
patch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't wait for everyone to get
released.
[SPEAKER_07]: They keep on going.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it facilitates the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can internalize membrane much
faster and more efficiently than thinking
[SPEAKER_07]: that you need everything to be ready for
one vesicle, internalize it, release,
[SPEAKER_07]: and start all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one last thing I wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plastic globules make exactly,
from what I see in the 2D images,
[SPEAKER_02]: these concatenated particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, we have no escorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have nothing on this machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we have in the chloroblast
monolayer particles that make these
[SPEAKER_02]: concatenated vesicles that look very much
alike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but in your case, you have the
accumulation of these lipophilic
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the two leaflets, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they make these great structures with a
little mech as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just that I don't know how they
decide to be a discrete blob instead of a
[SPEAKER_07]: huge blob.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why you have a small aggregation and not
just one huge one somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_07]: thylacol.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we know so little about our system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to wait for more proteomics
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's thank again, then.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
