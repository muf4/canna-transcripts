[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I spent time in Australia, and then in
about 2000 went overseas, joined the
[SPEAKER_04]: international set, and then went back to
Australia in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm back in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been around a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the title here, and I'm a specialist in
precision agriculture and what you might
[SPEAKER_04]: call on-farm experimentation and digital
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been around a lot, and I've seen
a lot of demand for actually getting
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: From research in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this talk is going to be a real
mishmash.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be some things that you're very
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be some things that you probably
don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are going to be some things that may
be new to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully, what I want to do is just
try and forge a picture of change and how
[SPEAKER_04]: we can, as researchers, we can get change
and why it's so important in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are, title, Delivering
Agricultural Research to Farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, is that going to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Microsoft.
[SPEAKER_04]: So delivering agricultural research to
farmers should actually be delivering
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural research not just to,
but also with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: In actual fact, seeing farmers not just as
recipients of research and of science,
[SPEAKER_04]: but actual co-innovators.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's worth trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the only thing for science to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's something that we've kind
of ignored and need to develop a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the outline, a little bit small there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'll do, first of all,
I'll just paint a picture of the demand
[SPEAKER_04]: for science and research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll then talk not just about production,
because we tend to focus quite a lot on
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to switch just emphasis a
little bit to food systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's where we are these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just want to spend a few
minutes talking about how do you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or what do you think science really does?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you actually get change in the
system?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you know that it's actually
occurred?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll talk a little bit about the theory
of change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll then spend a little bit of time
talking about the value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who actually gets the value from research?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we hardly ever think about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, it's a very under-researched
topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just finish off with a bit of
stuff that I really like doing the on-farm
[SPEAKER_04]: experimentation as an example of putting
farmers in the center of change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the outline.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want, you can go to sleep for part
of it, and then wake up for a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe stay awake for the first part,
and then doze off later.
[SPEAKER_04]: You OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's think a bit about the growing
demands for ag research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not from the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get my own farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not from a farm or farming
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even I can see that it's really
important globally, agricultural research,
[SPEAKER_04]: to support change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have the obvious one to start with
is population growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Population growth in North America are
still growing through 2050, reaching a
[SPEAKER_04]: plateau of about 2,100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe is already passing its peak growth
phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put these two together, you've still got
very moderate growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you think about Latin
America, that's still in its standard
[SPEAKER_04]: growth phase, should flatten out in the
next few decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compare that, tiny compared to the growth
of population throughout Asia,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly in India, but not just India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still growing and not due to peak
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: For another couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's worrying enough, heading us
towards 9 plus billion people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the really scary one for me is
that the growth of population in Africa
[SPEAKER_04]: projected to increase through to 2,100 and
increase further still.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we'll only reach the global peak
in about 2080.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's still a lot more people heading
our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the impacts are going to be massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the impacts on food demand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a graphic from the FAO.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll all have read those reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: Effectively a doubling of demand for food
production and protein throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it going to mean in terms of the
demand for land?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the business as usual,
another 100 million hectares, pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we get it right, if we get agriculture
really right, then there's some hope that
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll reduce the demand for further
extensification of agricultural land by
[SPEAKER_04]: intensification and other smart
agriculture to actually end up just a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not happening just yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have this third scenario,
which is called the stratified,
[SPEAKER_04]: they call it the stratified society
scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it basically means that no effort is
put into correcting inequalities
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: The FAO project an actual fact that if we
don't fix that, this is going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: demand for agricultural land, arable land
anyway, through to 2050, massive increase,
[SPEAKER_04]: much more than we can sustain.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shaded area here is the projections
of how much land will be lost through
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation, through not taking care.
[SPEAKER_04]: So huge demand for improvement in
efficiencies of agricultural systems and
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of investment in agricultural
landscape, really major.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the food going to come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just threw these in, just out of
amusement basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the figures from FAO for food
export, for wheat, millions of tons.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've had your good years and your bad
years, but generally it's slight upward
[SPEAKER_04]: trend, but more or less stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, you got new entries
into the global food market.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar story for corn or maize,
where you've got two new entries actually
[SPEAKER_04]: overtaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Eastern Europe again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is I guess the Ukraine effect
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in actual fact, Latin America,
Argentina and Brazil are going great guns
[SPEAKER_04]: to export more corn throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar story for soy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have growth of soy exports from
North America increasing, but those from,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly from Brazil, increasing even
more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be change in
production systems globally to meet
[SPEAKER_04]: massive growth in demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Production isn't the only thing that we
need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have a graph of greenhouse gas
emissions from meat-based systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two worrying trends here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge growth of greenhouse gases emission
from meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meat-based systems in Africa and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some places have actually got slightly
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: China is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big problem there, greenhouse gas
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar true for crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have these graphs if you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice is obviously the one that people are
worried about, but large growth in
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 equivalent
throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: A major concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another concern, food waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like 20, 30% of food is actually
wasted throughout the food system.
[SPEAKER_04]: This figure here, pure country in mind,
Australia and North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,520 calories lost or wasted per person
per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge losses within the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Major concern for the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another problem facing agricultural
research is the protection of natural
[SPEAKER_04]: capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, C.
[SPEAKER_04]: McKinsey produced this report last year
about getting companies on board to try
[SPEAKER_04]: and correct the erosion of natural capital
globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my point is it's not just production
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of different issues,
major issues facing agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Facing agricultural research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you all know all this, but there's a
switch to thinking towards food systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Food system thinking offers a much wider
scope for opportunities for research and
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm about to show you this diagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrendously complex, but it's the best
one I could find.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it portrays very well the complexity
of the food system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to make this a little bit easier to
think about, you can think about five
[SPEAKER_04]: domains.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where the business really starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The production domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this has occupied a lot of our
thinking for many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: How to produce more food.
[SPEAKER_04]: How to produce more stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in actual fact, when you take a food
system thinking, there are other domains
[SPEAKER_04]: that are equally important.
[SPEAKER_04]: In actual fact, I got tuned into this when
I looked into digital agriculture,
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to understand what was happening in
digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The investments in digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are more investments in digital
agriculture in this end of the system than
[SPEAKER_04]: there are in this end of the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to them, these are the bit that's
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The consumer side of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just about producing more
stuff and doing it better, but it's also
[SPEAKER_04]: learning what consumers want and need and
tuning the system towards their needs a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of attention also going into
processes, improving these complex food
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chains that actually get you from a
ton of maize through to the final product
[SPEAKER_04]: that people pay a lot for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two more domains to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the capitals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thinking about how can you protect and
nurture human and environmental capital on
[SPEAKER_04]: which the whole system depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tend to ignore that, but that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And increasingly important throughout the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fifth one is how are you going to
govern the whole system?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to manage finance?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to manage regulation to
actually keep the system working
[SPEAKER_04]: effectively and keeping these demands in
balance?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of thought gone into food
system thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it opens many different
avenues for agricultural research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, how does research actually
deliver change?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's one concept here that I
actually quite like.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people in the CG don't like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think, well, we've done a lot of good
work developing new germplasm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to worry too much about how
our change is actually occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're actually producing new
germplasm, you're producing a wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: seed, you can throw that seed into a
system and there's a reasonable chance if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the right thing that people will work
out how to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're actually looking about how the
system itself is being managed,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a lot more complex issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to think, or they have to
think, people have to think a lot harder
[SPEAKER_04]: about how the change is actually
occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we tend not to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so fixated on doing the work,
writing up the papers, publishing the
[SPEAKER_04]: papers, going on to the next paper,
that there's no reward in most research
[SPEAKER_04]: systems for actually thinking about the
actual change on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was something that I really liked
when I first went to Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CEO of the National Research
Organization came out and he said,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, I'm not really interested how many
papers you've published this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you've got to publish the papers
because that's how you learn your science.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't really care how many you've
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I need you to do is I need you to
tell me what science have you developed to
[SPEAKER_04]: enable change that I can report to public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can go to the politicians and
get the politicians off my back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, that was a revelation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because coming from the UK, which was a
highly academic system, and there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: huge disconnect between research and real
outcomes, to go to a system where research
[SPEAKER_04]: was being rewarded for its science,
providing it delivers some kind of change,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was quite important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I think the theory of change is
quite a helpful concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about your search,
could you actually do the theory of
[SPEAKER_04]: change?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you actually specify what is the
explicit or testable model of how and why
[SPEAKER_04]: change that you're supporting is actually
going to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can sometimes be quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, your change may not be
directly with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be helping somebody else who's
going to be helping farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an important part of the chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, you're in part of what's called
an impact pathway, which is an important
[SPEAKER_04]: concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: The theory of change also needs to
identify the context and the key actors in
[SPEAKER_04]: the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who actually are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you hoping to change?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are their behaviors that you're
expecting to change?
[SPEAKER_04]: And have you really thought about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whether you're delivering what's going
to enable them to change?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then think about the causal pathways a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can contribute to those outcomes and
impacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, not everybody in this room needs to
worry about all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're part of a change process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's good just to recognize what part
you play.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you have a theory of change
diagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought my diagrams were terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is even worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it puts all of the things together.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we tend to focus on as
researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Activities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're lucky, we'll think a bit
about the outputs, what we're producing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are our results?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are our papers or reports?
[SPEAKER_04]: But the process actually goes through
towards an outcome, which is basically a
[SPEAKER_04]: behavioral change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody's going to do something
differently that they couldn't have done
[SPEAKER_04]: if you hadn't delivered that output.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is it actually going to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here they talk about these things,
spheres of control, spheres of influence,
[SPEAKER_04]: and spheres of change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spheres of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only control this part of the
change process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're assuming and you're
understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because you talk to people who you
hope are going to use your research,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to help deliver these in the
sphere of influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the longer term, produce these
bigger term impacts that you think are
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, just going through this process
is very important, very helpful too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it actually helps you sharpen your
activities and outputs to actually achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: these goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't want to spend too much
longer on that because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I was a young researcher,
I'd really like to have learned a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that even if I focused on my bit,
I could see where it led towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's a bit of weird stuff here,
is that the value of the change drives
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: But who actually gets the value?
[SPEAKER_04]: Often we make assumptions about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got into this because when I looked
at digital agriculture, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: clear that there was a lot of work and a
lot of activities going on in digital
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But farmers didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an article in the Wall Street
Journal, Harold, you might have seen this
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a couple of years back about the
disappointment of big data in agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: and about disappointment of digital
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, everybody's still trying to
figure out where the value in data is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a farmer speaking and it was a
feature in the Wall Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason this came up is because
agriculture, here we had a graphic of the
[SPEAKER_04]: different sectors of the US economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't worry, the Australians were just
as bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the level of digitization within
the sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture, bottom of the class,
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, why is that actually
occurring?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to be the problem is that the
value isn't being delivered to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how to explain that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this isn't the prettiest of diagrams,
but I hope it gets somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best I found to try and help explain
this was from a series of work in the UK
[SPEAKER_04]: by an economist called Pavit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he identified how technology was used
in industries in the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he came up with this four-class model
that explained where the value was created
[SPEAKER_04]: and more importantly, where it was kept.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had these four classes and these
flashes are supposed to be value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, I'll explain these hopefully
in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take this one, because this one is
the one that we're probably most familiar
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I think he called it the public R
&D model, whereby governments invest in
[SPEAKER_04]: the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do that because they're expecting
that you will produce brilliant research
[SPEAKER_04]: outputs that have some public good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't mind you actually working for
Syngenta or somebody else, providing you
[SPEAKER_04]: do it at farm's length, because they're
saying, we want to use taxpayers' money to
[SPEAKER_04]: try and develop things that has a general
public good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what you might find, a mixture of
innovation hubs to try and help this
[SPEAKER_04]: process move along.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in agriculture, traditionally,
what we've tried to do is rely on an
[SPEAKER_04]: extension processes to get from here down
to here, these farmer groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the value is created here and it's
actually shared and often promulgated by
[SPEAKER_04]: publication processes to actually try and
spread the word.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the next model relies on private R&D.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Deere, Syngenta, Bayan, they have big
research budgets, good operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to publish or spread
their intellectual property any further
[SPEAKER_04]: than they have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they try to tend to keep it,
because that's where they're getting their
[SPEAKER_04]: value from.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a product that they want to sell
to farmers or others.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to sell the next product.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get more value out of the
next product, out of their R&D,
[SPEAKER_04]: by providing something that is considered
to be worth a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they keep the IP.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep the value in-house, different to
the one before.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually try and keep that in-house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite often, they'll protect that
quite fiercely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you see where the investment is
going in digital ag, you'll find a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: it is actually going into this kind of
thing, whereby a service or a product is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually being delivered to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the value stays with the
producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third type is what you might call
scale sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what it's not a great word.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it means is that the value is
generated at different parts of a supply
[SPEAKER_04]: chain or a value chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Economists can't work out whether they
prefer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you can think about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are large integrated organizations
within the food system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the food system diagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some large organizations within
that that they don't want disruptive
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want cumulative innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They see their position within the system
as being quite powerful and dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they want to try and hold that within
their organizations as much as they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll protect that IP as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have closed doors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't willingly share all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll expect that to be within their own
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can think of the large agricultural
agribusiness organizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd actually use technology,
learn, and keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But farmers, in these cases, are best seen
as suppliers of product and might get
[SPEAKER_04]: rewarded for it, or they might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not getting value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that leaves us with the last type of
model, which is what's called supplier
[SPEAKER_04]: dominated, not a great word.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, this is the one I would say
is missing somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'd like to think of,
and I'd try and see, is actually improving
[SPEAKER_04]: the value generation within this class of
business model in which farmers learn by
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, they much more, but also increase
the value that they can generate through
[SPEAKER_04]: networking and through technology
adoption.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, that is going to rely also
on these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the interaction between these,
and particularly from you guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: how do you actually get the processes
through to that so that they can start
[SPEAKER_04]: generating their value for themselves near
to hand?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we come on to on-farm
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just spend just a few minutes on
this, in which we see, as probably you do,
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers as co-innovators, not receivers of
innovation, but actually co-innovators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now when you say the word
experimentation, it raises all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: things, particularly in research
institutes such as this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can think about what is an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And often we use experiments to explore
theories.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say there is different types
of experiments and different types of
[SPEAKER_04]: experimental thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is around epistemic theory driven,
which tends to have a semantic focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that you're interested in the
meaning that the results represent to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to do that, you need to have the
theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are scientists implemented,
because that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we learn as scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's another type of experiment,
which is action guiding theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you talk to a farmer about the results
of an experiment that they put in,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're less interested in actually why it
occurred.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do want to know why it occurred,
but they're less interested in why it
[SPEAKER_04]: occurred, but the fact that it did occur
and that it means something to them in
[SPEAKER_04]: that system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could say that they're sort of
characterized pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care why it did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know it does it every year and I
want to fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's much stronger action.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more pragmatic action,
and it's user implemented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what I'd say is that in agriculture,
we actually might have taken a wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: turning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because experimentation, was the core of
agricultural development for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the 1920s, Sir Ronald, he came out
with this fantastic analysis of variance,
[SPEAKER_04]: mathematically elegant thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the learning at that time definitely
switched strongly to specialists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we moved into sort of a style of
working with a lot of germplasm research,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then precision ag came along.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was driven from here, or the wheat,
the corn belt anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And learning and IP tended to be distanced
somewhat from farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers again were pushed into the
position of being buyers of intellectual
[SPEAKER_04]: products and services that were developed
by others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're trying to do with the OFE
here, Pharmacentric OFE, is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to shift the emphasis back to
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got two different types of change
processes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the exogenous one that we've
tended to use for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're aiming for certain generalizable
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really know too much about the
relevance because we tend not to ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know about the adoption rate and
are often disappointed that there should
[SPEAKER_04]: be more, but it hasn't happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it generally has a low doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because the experiment is where
the data was generated.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put it out, you don't tend to
follow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The endogenous approach, we want to see
pharmacentric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers come up with the questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The results are often highly variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our experience, they're often highly
variable and quite uncertain, but they're
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely relevant on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're easily adopted because they're
framed by the farmer and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: interpreted with the farmer in ways that
they can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they tend to create a lot of doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's one that we started with.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture, it's a terrible picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually lost track of it completely,
but this was the first of our large
[SPEAKER_04]: on-farm experimentations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the bloody 90s, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 30 years ago, almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was done almost by accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a farmer's boy who was brilliant at
the technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he actually developed the first
variable rate technology in Australia to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce this checkerboard test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thought it was just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: The farmer loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agronomists hated it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we analyzed the results of
this experiment, and it was our first
[SPEAKER_04]: experiment, 72 hectares, we found that
there were many different sources of
[SPEAKER_04]: variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had set this out as a nitrogen trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in actual fact, there were weeds
there, there was wetness, there was
[SPEAKER_04]: drought all in the same area.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a potassium deficiency over one
part, another part, a trace element
[SPEAKER_04]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said to the farmer, sorry, Doug,
this is impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we make sense of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just too many things going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: In actual fact, nitrogen, even though we'd
plastered it with soil samples and had a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good agronomist working with us,
we still were unable to explain why.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was much more than about 30% of the
area, the response over 30% of the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the farm said, well, welcome to my
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I have to deal with every
paddock every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's uncertain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this information, even though it
covers only part of the area, it's still
[SPEAKER_04]: useful to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe it, because it's on my land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we thought this was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in actual fact, it wasn't the first of
farmer-centric attempts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of work had been going on in the
80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Larry Harrington, he was here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember Larry?
[SPEAKER_04]: He did a lot of this earlier work with
CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And SEAT, Jackie Ashby, they did a lot of
participatory research.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't have the data that we have
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't have the processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weren't able to capture the value
put back into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, we got onto this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did all sorts of weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had strips, replicated strips,
blocks, doughnuts, checkers, all sorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: experimental design.
[SPEAKER_04]: The farmers liked all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: In many cases, the agronomists found it
very difficult to work with because the
[SPEAKER_04]: results were too big, too uncertain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the basic process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first one is you need
organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to organize time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be with one to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to look for organizing
entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our area, it was farmer groups,
or it could have been a supplier.
[SPEAKER_04]: These sort of things, the organization is
key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers do the inquiry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start looking to see what happens if
I do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The specialists support, let me help you
with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the farmers and specialists
together interpret the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they continue inquiry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very simple process.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, we had lots of different types.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had lots of designs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actually one of our earliest
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were very proud of that, but nobody
else liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Checkerboard and strips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farms do these in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know here they do a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actually the largest one we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 6,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was in oil palm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just wanted to know what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Enrich strip or the strip trials,
those are very commonly used experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite large.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the important thing about that is that
we see it as a continuous, what we call a
[SPEAKER_04]: racetrack process of engagement,
data capture, analysis, interpretation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a mixture of technical and
social processes going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some basic rules that we applied.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found them useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first was obviously keep it
farmer-centric.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one that the farmer more or less
put in without help.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just wanted to do it himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the experimental structure simple,
because the landscape is big, and it will
[SPEAKER_04]: get complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep the experimental design as simple
as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that you want to use, as far as
possible, commercial machinery.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the farmer to be able to install
the experiment without thinking too much
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be in cordon with their ways
of managing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other reason is that farmers
understand and manage their land according
[SPEAKER_04]: to landscape clues and signals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They understood, for example, that this
bit of dirt down here produced these
[SPEAKER_04]: results for that reason, and that this was
quite different up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, they like it big because
it helps them interpret it and apply it to
[SPEAKER_04]: management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are times when farmers don't want to
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are times when they're too busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are certain times where we had
this rule, keep out of the way,
[SPEAKER_04]: make it easy, and keep explicit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep exploring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so those were the basic ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you actually get value from the
process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here we have a number of kind of
quotes about what are the sort of things
[SPEAKER_04]: that they found.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a number of characteristics
about the way that farmers said they found
[SPEAKER_04]: these results helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is that it was pretty clear
what worked to them and what didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: what was important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cumulative one is when it helps them
learn much more about their system,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they become more certain to the point
at which they can make those critical
[SPEAKER_04]: management change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one is that sharing can be
important, that actually a collective use
[SPEAKER_04]: of insight can be really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just a couple of minutes to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you actually scale up the whole
process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how many of you might
be familiar with this, but we use the
[SPEAKER_04]: business model canvas idea to actually
couple the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what the business model canvas
approach does, and we might think we're
[SPEAKER_04]: proud if we get a few hundred or even a
thousand citations, this has actually got
[SPEAKER_04]: over 20, 22,000, I think, is all very
widely used in the business world concept
[SPEAKER_04]: of basically putting the whole package
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concentrate on these two bits.
[SPEAKER_04]: First is what's the basic idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to offer a new service,
or what are you going to produce that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to help people, and who actually
will you benefit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be farmers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be certain types of
farmers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be consultants,
maybe suppliers?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't worked out that,
then you can't work out what this whole
[SPEAKER_04]: business model is doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can work that out, then you can
actually develop a business model that can
[SPEAKER_04]: be scaled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so the final part of this RFE
story is actually networking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Janice, you'd recognize some of these
places, probably with horror, but there we
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was just our first attempt at
this after doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was instantly a network of
people who are interested in trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: develop this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really important from a scaling
up point of view, because you can't be
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to individual farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to actually scale out the
business model for impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in summary, what have I been talking
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, hopefully I made it pretty
clear that agriculture has to get more
[SPEAKER_04]: active, and there are still some really
major problems facing us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And research, it's really a good time to
be in agricultural research, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an awful lot to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think it's valuable and important
to think a bit, not just about production,
[SPEAKER_04]: but think about the food systems and think
about the places within the food system
[SPEAKER_04]: you might like the research you're doing
to actually impact and change things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say farmers are often not the only
or even most common developers of research
[SPEAKER_04]: insight as currently done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are not often the recipients of
value according to those four business
[SPEAKER_04]: models.
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been that value generated
with farms for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tend to be treated or assumed to be
as customers or clients of valuable IP
[SPEAKER_04]: generated from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Cornell might be somewhat
different in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it always had an extension mindset of
government funded change, but still good
[SPEAKER_04]: to focus on how the value is going to be
generated and how far is that going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'm saying and what I'm
working on personally and with Louis is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually farmer-centric co-innovation with
networking to develop this value-based IP
[SPEAKER_04]: with farmers and actually networking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say here, there's a huge new role
for researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not just agronomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've actually got to have some social
sciences in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll have the data sciences too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's very rare to find in any
university combination of agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: sciences, social sciences, and data
sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's going to be a mix of those in
there to actually really get on top of
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the real goal too is that
you want farmers to go digital.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where the opportunity
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those words, digital, dirty word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital is a good word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The floor is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will look here if there are questions on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any page to the left?
[SPEAKER_04]: First question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when you think of it, commodity crop
production can treat farmers as basically
[SPEAKER_04]: like surfers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or surf producers somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you can't generate value at the
point of production, then the per unit
[SPEAKER_04]: value at the point of production is
relatively small.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you see a lot of the value in
digitization anyway in the commodities is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually taken by that second class of the
integrated supply chain operator.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get the value from that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually want to drive down the price
of commodity the most they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're happy to receive product from
wherever they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about high quality or high
value production, there's much more scope
[SPEAKER_04]: for value generation around farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I live in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only sustainable part of Colombian
agriculture is high quality coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a very high skill level
needed to produce quality coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And incidentally, it was the only area
that was never governed by a guerrilla.
[SPEAKER_04]: They always organized themselves because
they had very strong social capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an example of, yes, the higher
the value of the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in New York, you have certain high
value products that are really important,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a strong connection with
customer base down the right hand side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the food system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can produce more value by learning
what the customer wants and actually
[SPEAKER_04]: learning how to produce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned farming systems research.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, like FSRD, which started in the
70s, late 70s, these concepts have been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for plus 40 years, right,
verbatim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You suggested that one point of failure
might have been lack of data to work at
[SPEAKER_00]: that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that's the entire
explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering if you had other
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I also mentioned I don't think they
looked at the value proposition idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of a new concept to try
and work out, well, what is the
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamental change that's going to create
the value?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are you actually going to produce
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: To actually go through that process,
you need to get through to this business
[SPEAKER_04]: model concept that is probably,
well, it post-dates the earlier farming
[SPEAKER_04]: system research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the farming system research stuff
that I saw, I thought, well, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was always dependent on external
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always the projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once the project money ran out,
then it was chow farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice working with you, but we can't come
back here anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought when I saw that, we have to get
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to try and work out a way in which
either farmers themselves or suppliers or
[SPEAKER_04]: buyers are actually prepared to subsidize
or invest in that process that involves
[SPEAKER_04]: the farms and is around the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we really understand how
to do that until we thought about the
[SPEAKER_04]: business model thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So well spotted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought we were fantastic doing this
farm research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came across all this stuff that
Larry had done 20, 30 years earlier that
[SPEAKER_04]: we were talking about in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in Seattle, they did a lot of
work on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they hadn't got over these two
fundamental barriers.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because without data, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be cheap data because you have
to have an easy process, a cost-efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: process, if you like, for the farmer to
actually provide insight.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask farmers to go out and even
measure on yield cuts, often they won't do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too much work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they just might not have time to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to have easy, cheap data to
do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in our case, we were using precision ag
technology because every harvester comes
[SPEAKER_04]: with that technology built into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These days, we're looking at remote
sensing to provide a backup for cheap data
[SPEAKER_04]: so you can guarantee a process can run.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also need the second part,
which is the business model, which
[SPEAKER_04]: actually identifies the value and actually
works out how it's all going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question, kind of your thoughts in
terms of thinking about for developed
[SPEAKER_03]: countries and less developed countries or
often kind of the global north,
[SPEAKER_03]: global south.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the data collection in these different
areas, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking like in the US here, we have a
really great land-grant system and
[SPEAKER_03]: extension system where there is a lot of
on-farm research and hopefully unbiased
[SPEAKER_03]: science driven on-farm research here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tend to go to the developed countries
and there's a lot more on-farm research,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we make from private companies,
like Congenta, Bayer, and kind of the bias
[SPEAKER_03]: around the data collection in these
different areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know any thoughts on that and how
that may drive farmer decisions in those
[SPEAKER_03]: areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, there's a lot of work in Africa around
farmer groups because one of the key
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you need is you need that
organization to actually enable the
[SPEAKER_04]: process to run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there is a lot of attention to
farming groups and they're very interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in this process as a means of farmers
generating their own insight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need the cheap data.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need that cheap data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get data, but it's not that
easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're looking at imagery,
remote sensing, to actually provide that
[SPEAKER_04]: imagery.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question about how would you trust the
results from Bayer, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have the biggest incentive to
actually work with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those that I've spoke to, they're
quite keen to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers aren't stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're happy to work with Bayer,
but there has to be a clear arrangement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite interesting when we were
working with a fertilizer company in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fertilizer company was rolling out
their program of on-farm experimentation
[SPEAKER_04]: with their clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said to the guy who was running it
for the fertilizer company, I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you realize that farmers might use
these results to buy less fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_04]: not more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You realize, I need to tell you that right
now, because they might see that half of
[SPEAKER_04]: their land just isn't responding at all,
so they'll buy much less than they did
[SPEAKER_04]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: His response was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, our main game is to establish
trust with the buyer, because we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to lose our clients and then have to
try and find them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, as far as we're concerned,
we're prepared to take a reduction in
[SPEAKER_04]: volume if we have them as a client
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that really caught my attention,
because what that meant was that the trust
[SPEAKER_04]: between the buyer and the seller or the
supplier and the farmer user.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the moment, throughout Africa,
well, Harold, you know this, is that at
[SPEAKER_04]: the moment, fertilizer is shipped out,
shipped into country, distributed,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then from then on, most suppliers have
no idea what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even know where it went half
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could change that kind of model to
one in which the supplier has a much more
[SPEAKER_04]: vested interest to actually enable farmers
to use it better through this
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer-centric process, that's what we're
aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the balance of trust is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tricky one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tricky one, but a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are cases where that is
done, where farmers have to be persuaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtually every farmer I've spoken to is
keen to do it, because they like to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember that the fiber, you have to
be careful about the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't come in and say, you're going to
do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go in and ask the question,
what are you interested in changing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you're designing the
experiment, it has to be easy for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: install.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you hear about a lot, or you read a lot
of publications talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: on-farm experimentations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're too complex to survive outside
the research ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to design it in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've never found difficulty in getting
farmers to trial, providing you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of days ago, I taught a class
for our freshmen, sustainable agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: for our first semester freshmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 10 minutes in, it was about
digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 10 minutes in, the students
asked a number of very exciting questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the one that Debbie just asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also a question about,
well, what about the public versus the
private sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to do all the on-farm
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, the information that you
gather and the knowledge that you develop
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be delivered on a continuing
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There need to be services provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to go into a piece of software or
equipment or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is your experience in taking all
the knowledge that you gain from this and
[SPEAKER_01]: make it permanent for the farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you deliver it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should it be through the public sector,
private sector?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we have three models in our mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the semi-automatic model.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually have these RFEs
semi-automatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's actually services provided.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a model that's been used
commercially by people in Australia and
[SPEAKER_04]: probably here, too, who will put out an
experiment for you on your machinery.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will analyze the results,
feed you back the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cheap sort of standard thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's hardly been any take-up in that,
because there's no interpretation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: result.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second model is one where you have a
facilitated interpretation of the results
[SPEAKER_04]: to create knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the knowledge is the more permanent
entity in that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the bit that we're trying to
focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knowledge is much more permanent and
communicable than just individual results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And individual results, often farmers
aren't that keen in those results actually
[SPEAKER_04]: being distributed widely anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're happy to share them within their
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third type of RFE is actually one
which we call a research-based,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're just looking for that
generalizable result that's actually done
[SPEAKER_04]: in field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can be distributed much more
widely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the result is more general and less
useful to individual farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Harold, I hope that answers your
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically what I'm saying is the
knowledge is a much more durable IP and
[SPEAKER_04]: value entity than either individual
results, uninterpreted, or in some cases,
[SPEAKER_04]: the research type of result.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the knowledge and the distribution of
the knowledge which seems to have
[SPEAKER_04]: particular value to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can be spread, but partially.
[SPEAKER_04]: The technique can be spread anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the individual results, you have to be
more careful actually distributing those.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
