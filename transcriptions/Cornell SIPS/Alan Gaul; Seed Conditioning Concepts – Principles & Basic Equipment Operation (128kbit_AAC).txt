[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then I'd like to just take a moment
here to thank Dr. Taylor as well here that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the pleasure of working with him
on a number as he mentioned a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations he's done for us and I know
whenever he does make it to Ames why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually a great opportunity to go to lunch
or something and discuss things that have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed in the industry you know the
different trends and he's always a wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: of information on some of the you know the
more specialized sea treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and some of his research and
I can show him a little bit on what we see
[SPEAKER_00]: on the equipment and so forth so today
it's kind of a pleasure to be able to to
[SPEAKER_00]: share some of it without having to get on
an airplane and fly someplace so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some mixed advantages I guess in
the situation where everything seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: on zoom these days but also I am I am
trying out a few pieces of technology as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're we're debating what to do with our
workshops for this next year and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be able to do some of it virtually
if we need to and I'm testing part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: in technology here today so we'll is is
they like to say you know technology is
[SPEAKER_00]: great is all when it works properly so
we'll see where it goes again so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: switch back and forth we'll try to take a
break a couple times during this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation at least maybe follow up on
the chat and some other things with it
[SPEAKER_00]: likewise I apologize if I'm jerking back
and forth a little bit like this because I
[SPEAKER_00]: am running four monitors here so it it's
tough to always look at it and still see
[SPEAKER_00]: it without getting further back away so
with that I'd like to go ahead and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get started as you mentioned about an hour
and a half of stuff I like to joke with
[SPEAKER_00]: the students that we do it handle in for
the academic classes that humans have been
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning seed for several thousand years
and we're going to cover all of it the
[SPEAKER_00]: next you know in this case an hour and a
half so frequently highly caffeinated
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation but if you can bear with me
and we'll take it from there Dr. Taylor's
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned a few of the things that we do
this was the seed science building early
[SPEAKER_00]: on and a floor plan from it so I spend
most of my time in the elevated part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the building here or right next to it in
my office and you know there's just a view
[SPEAKER_00]: from the north side fortunately we don't
have the snow today but that could happen
[SPEAKER_00]: most any time and as you mentioned I do a
lot of seed conditioning workshops or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know seed processing as it's known
elsewhere in the world but we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: industry on different topics that you know
would be relevant for people working in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants I do a lot of student lab
sessions for various academic labs where
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do one or two labs and a couple of
lectures or something to give them the
[SPEAKER_00]: content that's relevant to that class we
do some of our own research on seed
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning and help work with an awful
lot of researchers I joke that I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: small piece of a lot of projects that
where they need to clean or sort or treat
[SPEAKER_00]: or this lately people have been counting
seed like crazy once they got done
[SPEAKER_00]: shelling this fall so a little bit on the
workshops there may be a few people on
[SPEAKER_00]: here that have been to the workshops
before and if so you know that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: students that work for me put a poster
together at the end of each year and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first things I see people do when
they come to the workshops is they they
[SPEAKER_00]: run in to see if they got on the poster
because it's really a photo montage that
[SPEAKER_00]: the students put together and so there was
2018 if anybody happened to be there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as 2019 and they're really not a
highly technical poster just a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: and I joke that the students take a lot of
photos because if you fill the poster with
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures you don't have to write very much
so with that today what I'd like to take
[SPEAKER_00]: some time to do is to kind of review more
or less in this order a few basic concepts
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of seed conditioning 101 but
we're going to be talking about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the concepts that are involved here a
little bit on handling a little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and so forth up front basically
some of the harvest post harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that kind of cause problems
sometimes for people and then most of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be talking about is dry
granular separation you know the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're doing to clean and sort and
upgrade the seed and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce a few quality control concepts
as we go and again the whole business on
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment I'm going to show you a
little bit on plant operations some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key principles we're really not going to
be able to get into and do adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: much on this time I joke sometimes that I
have I spend the entire summer talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this so I run out of time then so
the likelihood of covering everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour and a half isn't real great so
first off you know is your maybe working
[SPEAKER_00]: on I know you're an hour ahead of me so
you're probably on that second cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee instead of the first but why are we
doing this in the first place if it really
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do with getting this ready for
market okay if it's seed corn which we
[SPEAKER_00]: have plenty of here in Iowa it comes in on
the ear it's very high moisture husks and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth on it certainly not ready to put
in the bag and so a lot of things have to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to get that at least cleaned and
sized and sorted and then ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: treated if it's something a bit easier we
joke here sometimes in Iowa that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: all alternative crops means corn and
soybeans realize you've got a more diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: mix out there fortunately we do work with
a lot of other things at seed science than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the general field crops that we'd
have here but soybeans again are a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier we may have to get splits and weed
seeds and you know moldy discolored seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: other foreign material out and I get into
some food grade products as well so these
[SPEAKER_00]: were dry beans the little maroon colored
ones here is butzuki beans typically for
[SPEAKER_00]: export to Japan but this happened to be an
organic seed lot where weed control got
[SPEAKER_00]: out of hand so if somebody needed a bunch
of ragweed we did develop a process for
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning those up for seed so again I tend
to take a kind of a broad brush approach
[SPEAKER_00]: here to seed conditioning and it's
basically the post harvest operations that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd be involved at a plant so anything
from perhaps secondary threshing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: drying cleaning things up I do get into
seed treatment and whatnot as well however
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be covered in
substantially more detail this afternoon
[SPEAKER_00]: okay there are I understand you have some
people that are doing stuff they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: just corn and soybeans so when I get into
this was flax it's an indeterminate crop
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're not mature at the same time
sometimes the different grasses may have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be stripped a few times things like
fruit or tomatoes and how to get the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there you get into extraction we're
not going to cover that today but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to bring up you know many of the
issues that would occur so we wind up with
[SPEAKER_00]: a range of different workshops to try to
cover you know those topics again as dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor mentioned I've been hanging around
this business since the early 80s and when
[SPEAKER_00]: I started on this a lot of my clients that
I worked with for plant design were
[SPEAKER_00]: mom-and-pop type operations that certainly
changed over the years a few of Midwestern
[SPEAKER_00]: plants here have been added just to kind
of show you the scale of the operations
[SPEAKER_00]: that we often deal with so I have the I'm
fortunate to be able to work with everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: from small mom-and-pop companies to some
of the big multinationals okay if we start
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking a walk around the seed plant
which sort of what this is we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less follow the flow the different
components would be you know things
[SPEAKER_00]: related to you know receiving the product
drying and temporary storage there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of handling that goes on I'm going to just
briefly cover you know most of the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that are raised by that today and a little
bit on some physical separation with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: on that actually today and then again just
introduce the treating and we'll finish
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of slides just to finish our
walkthrough on the plant again most of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're going to be covering today is a
little bit on the material handling and
[SPEAKER_00]: lots on cleaning and sorting okay just a
couple quick comments things that go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I worked with post harvest but the
typical complaint that I hear when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to seed plant people is that the
combine operator did something wrong okay
[SPEAKER_00]: either they beat the seed up or they
didn't clean up properly between varietal
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination is a huge issue and
something that we can't magically remove
[SPEAKER_00]: unless there's some difference between the
two varieties that we can use the other
[SPEAKER_00]: big thing I run across is the need to
properly dry and storage you know this
[SPEAKER_00]: seed you know if we can control the
moisture kind of coming in properly aerate
[SPEAKER_00]: it we can do a lot of things to help
maintain that seed and sometimes you know
[SPEAKER_00]: drying to a safe level is an important
part of that I see too many cases where
[SPEAKER_00]: things go wrong moisture really does
matter and you know there's just kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: list here I'm not going to go through all
of them but things that we wind up talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about on moisture and sometimes when I
have the luxury of doing this in seed
[SPEAKER_00]: science I can bring in some of our
speakers much like Dr. Taylor talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell speakers we have Iowa State
speakers that will come in and hit some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this as well as other guest instructors so
then the other big thing again I work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same building as the seed testing lab
they have a lot of different tests that
[SPEAKER_00]: are run but at a plant sometimes we're
looking for very simple tests that are
[SPEAKER_00]: often based on the same physical
properties that we might use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine so if we're checking a cleaner we
might use hand screens or something to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's doing the right job I mentioned
moisture that's probably the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's checked somebody may be familiar
with taking test weight you know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds per bushel perhaps you get this
from your moisture meter we frequently are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for broken seed testing for seed
coat damage on things like soybeans here
[SPEAKER_00]: we do and I mentioned seed counting
earlier that the grad students have been
[SPEAKER_00]: counting and counting we had seed counters
running literally 40 hours a week or more
[SPEAKER_00]: here for the last month but you know so
the number of seeds per pound or a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand kernel weight can be important
sometimes we're grading for visual defects
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what we're looking for and
this gets beyond the scope today but
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged units and so forth how many
what's the weight of the bag and meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory requirements and then I'm an
engineer so we put numbers to about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything but you know capacity percent
discards yield and whatnot okay so again
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I mentioned that there's
typically large volumes of stuff going
[SPEAKER_00]: through that may not be the case if you're
dealing with tomatoes or perhaps pumpkins
[SPEAKER_00]: or something but many of the field crops
will have a lot of material handling
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment moving things from point A to
point B depending on where those points
[SPEAKER_00]: are could be elevator legs going straight
up belt conveyors and inclines are
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal some technology that's borrowed
from the grain industry sometimes for
[SPEAKER_00]: filling bins a lot of vibratory conveyors
within the towers and pneumatic conveyors
[SPEAKER_00]: to blow more often discard but sometimes
other product whatever goes up must come
[SPEAKER_00]: down so we've got some gravity spouts and
letdowns in here as well okay one big
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with all this mechanical handling
can be damaged okay we might break or hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed somehow I like to joke sometimes
that whatever the gravity separator in the
[SPEAKER_00]: color sorter or cleaner gibbeth the
handling system can take it away so we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be careful about that again
soybeans are almost a poster child for
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical damage I joke sometimes if you
look at them too long they might break but
[SPEAKER_00]: you see most the studies on it this was an
early one I was involved with as an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrad actually but looking at the
effects through six different plants over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of the winter and sampling
everything they tried to include one screw
[SPEAKER_00]: conveyor at the beginning and auger and
lost over two percent damage on the
[SPEAKER_00]: average just for that in germination and
there was also a moisture effect dry
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans tend to break more easily than
regular moisture so again moisture matters
[SPEAKER_00]: on that point too you can overdrive
product and have issues with that so
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the biggest single thing without
going into every possible machine you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have is that this really boils down
to not hitting things too fast or being in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong place at the wrong time so if
you can reduce seed velocity maybe we can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce drop height we can slow the machine
down sometimes we can use a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: conveyor and run it at a slower speed to
handle the same capacity if you have maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a screw conveyor or something in here
using a lowest possible incline don't
[SPEAKER_00]: raise it up too far and then drop it
farther down and again being in the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: place involves impact or abrasion or being
crushed by a machine somehow or being
[SPEAKER_00]: sheared off being cut by a sharp edge
someplace so we can eliminate some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those pinch points brand new equipment
frequently has nice sharp edges coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the factory so running that in for a
while can be useful and trying to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the conveyors running full can be
important that isn't maybe so critical on
[SPEAKER_00]: belts or something but again rubber or
plastic contact surfaces if you hear a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of noise with stuff crashing into steel
there's usually a good indicator that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some damage as well and most seed
companies that were with do try to modify
[SPEAKER_00]: the conveyors to avoid these problems for
obvious reasons there is some evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans being sensitive to cold
temperatures and it's somewhat anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's at least split generation can
be worse those of you that happen to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into it we have lots of discussions on how
cold that may be but we'll leave it for
[SPEAKER_00]: there now okay i promised you we'd spend
most of our time on separation so when i
[SPEAKER_00]: walk around a plant and again i did plant
design for for years and i joke that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you have all these different parts
but no two plants are ever alike and you
[SPEAKER_00]: put them together in different sequence
depending what you're trying to do so some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those puzzle pieces would be things
like you know an aspirator perhaps we can
[SPEAKER_00]: separate things by aerodynamic properties
maybe we you know almost everybody has a
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner of some sort that's going to work
with size and shape as well as the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know built-in aspirations we're frequently
doing a lot of sizing in the corn industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for seed corn the tower is frequently
called a sizing tower because of the how
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant those machines may be in there if
you're dealing with a spherical product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more like soybeans or rapeseed
perhaps we have spiral separators that
[SPEAKER_00]: would work on how well it rolls to
separate shriveled from round gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: separators are very important for removing
maybe low density seed that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate so well or other contaminants
and finally that the of the common
[SPEAKER_00]: machines we get into color variation
things that you know would be discolored
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be removed optically and this
is kind of an evolving software technology
[SPEAKER_00]: now to words we're really frequently
talking about optical sorting where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at shape or other factors
okay so just how do these pieces go
[SPEAKER_00]: together again i told you no two plants
are really the same but this was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: flow for soybeans and small grain so
probably higher chance that some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing the cereal grains there in which
case you know perhaps we're coming in we
[SPEAKER_00]: may have a debirter i don't see those in
all the plants but it's basically some
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary threshing that goes on before
the cleaner the cleaner takes out most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trash depending on what we're running
there's frequently machines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat industry specific either an
indent to remove differences in length
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe on the cereal grains or a spiral
that might take out the oblong seed
[SPEAKER_00]: there's various configurations you might
have on a gravity table to separate by
[SPEAKER_00]: density if the color sorter is there it
could be typically ahead of the treater or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes i see it after the cleaner
particularly in a seed corn plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: treater when it's when it exists for a
particular process and you know some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of packaging or again depends on market
okay a seed corn plant might look
[SPEAKER_00]: something more like this again the biggest
difference here i frequently see the color
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter after the cleaner technically ahead
of the sizers they don't have to run all
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual sizes numbers of sizes and
scope of these plants will definitely vary
[SPEAKER_00]: as well but it looks something like this
you know the biggest difference in again
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed corn is almost always sized for
us markets anyway okay so i work with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the engineering students and i like to
explain that the difference here but with
[SPEAKER_00]: seed cleaning compared to other forms of
you know same manufacturing that they may
[SPEAKER_00]: be working with is frequently people talk
about like 3d printing being an additive
[SPEAKER_00]: process whereas something like machining
is a subtractive process and basically if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dealing with seed cleaning i
mentioned that we have different machines
[SPEAKER_00]: that are separating things and we're
basically removing stuff from it so it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: subtractive process and we're basically
carving away at this thing you know by
[SPEAKER_00]: removing everything that we can blow away
and everything that's too big and small
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe things that are the wrong
density or things that are the wrong color
[SPEAKER_00]: until we hopefully try to remove
everything that's not desirable from the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that we want and typically we'll have
to use more than one machine to get there
[SPEAKER_00]: plus we're just separating i don't know
golf balls from seed or something so what
[SPEAKER_00]: are we removing and i suspect most people
on here whoops sorry could give me this
[SPEAKER_00]: list but you know we're after the foreign
material you know weed seeds other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical damage we'd prefer not to break
it um varietal contamination is very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to remove and uh then we get
into when we start talking about upgrading
[SPEAKER_00]: and removing low quality seed you know why
is it bad is typically either uh seed
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology which uh or different pathogens
that we may have uh that would affect it
[SPEAKER_00]: okay um now i i talked about how we're
carving away at things and um we uh we
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently seem to get into various
histograms uh different bell-shaped curves
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was a box i actually built as an
undergraduate and the students found it
[SPEAKER_00]: back found two of them back a while back
and we used these before we had bar graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: and computers and so forth and you would
basically drop things through sitters and
[SPEAKER_00]: hand screens and then pour each hand
screen content into one of these and it
[SPEAKER_00]: generated a graph that we could use for
teaching and you can see that we get this
[SPEAKER_00]: bell-shaped curve on here again and those
of you who ever worked with screen
[SPEAKER_00]: selection know that you're trying to pick
the screens to trim the tails of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bell-shaped curve as much as possible
without losing a good seed so uh you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's uh interesting at least to uh to talk
about that and uh as we start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about things like a gravity separator
you're looking at a density curve that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to trim on color sorters
you're literally seeing this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: probability information sometimes shown
graphically and that's you know sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's set so we're we're basically
going through a sequence of machines
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming each curve as far as we can
before you lose too much good seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then back off a bit and then at the end if
there's still defects we have to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: what seed what machine would be the best
for removing that defect and go make the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate adjustments okay again when
we're talking about separation efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: any theoretical process that we might have
here you know a simple one perhaps just
[SPEAKER_00]: has you know product and discard good seed
and they're rarely ever 100 efficient so
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're talking about it it's you know
it's kind of like a batting average but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what percentage of the defects
did we get typically we won't get all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them but we can also deal with recovery of
good product because one way we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the defects is to throw a whole
bunch of good seed away but the economics
[SPEAKER_00]: of that are not good either so you know
what's the yield and i like to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed plants are typically between the
proverbial rock and a hard place where
[SPEAKER_00]: quality control wants to remove all the
contaminants and the accounting people
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to keep every good seed and
those are kind of conflicting results plus
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you need it all done
quickly by a schedule and within budget we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into some things with separation
efficiency i'm going to stay off most of
[SPEAKER_00]: that today just keep in mind that getting
complete contaminant removal typically
[SPEAKER_00]: means you have to remove at least a small
amount of good product okay here was just
[SPEAKER_00]: a hypothetical graph this is not real data
it's just something i made to uh in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel room at 11 o'clock at night to
explain the idea but if i'm adjusting some
[SPEAKER_00]: machine maybe it's an aspirator and uh
removal deficiency levels are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: given from zero to one uh the idea was
that if i turn up that aspirator i can
[SPEAKER_00]: throw more and more defects away i may not
get all of them um but you know i probably
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to run clear to the right
because if i look at my yield a good seed
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm starting to throw good seed away as i
crank up that air um and so again that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a way to combine that but that
curve uh varies a lot depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: application so if you can keep in mind
we're talking about yield that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of the good seed we kept and
we're talking about you know defect
[SPEAKER_00]: removal or efficiencies type thing it's
usually just you know how much of the a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular defect that we got out okay a
seed plant's usually going to try to run
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in that range uh and a lot of
this is really done uh by experience for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular application okay i'd like to
talk again we're dealing with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment operators and so about you know
different tools so you know why do we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the different tools for it and i mentioned
that this is somewhat of a subtractive
[SPEAKER_00]: process and so much like wood carving you
know you're carving away it and removing
[SPEAKER_00]: things and so uh you know sometimes at a
state fair or something you'll see this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy with a chainsaw who's uh making stuff
and he has 10 minutes total to do it in
[SPEAKER_00]: one tool but if you have more precise
tools you can get better details and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know good operator that understands
the capability those tools and how and
[SPEAKER_00]: when to use them can provide superior
results this statue happens to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: outside seed science it's george
washington carver and so uh i've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of slides here we're going to talk
about different tools four of them then
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm going to give you examples on each one
as we go through but uh perhaps we can
[SPEAKER_00]: come in here and we have an aspirator okay
humans have probably been blowing light
[SPEAKER_00]: product you know wheat from chaff or
something for longer than almost anything
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh in this case uh we're looking at uh
you know either usually an inclined or a
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical column and just the difference in
how fast that seed will fall through the
[SPEAKER_00]: airstream okay a cleaner combines that
again with some perforated screens and
[SPEAKER_00]: typically will blow some trash away at the
beginning and then clean things to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: you know too large and too small basically
to scalp and sift the product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: finish with a second aspiration that's
more precise in order to get more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: low quality seeds away sometimes that's
the only machine needed for simple
[SPEAKER_00]: applications but other times it's just the
beginning of the process the cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: almost always takes the bulk of the the
contaminant out okay um aspirators come in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different form factors i see
quite a few of these multiple past ones
[SPEAKER_00]: around the midwest just for kind of
pre-cleaning uh those of you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in something like that a
disc-shaped seed like tomato or pepper i
[SPEAKER_00]: see these more out in california so it's
uh something that uh peter marx will have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen probably more often but um you know
there's they're just different
[SPEAKER_00]: configurations of the same notion
depending what they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish okay um one problem with just
aspirating is that you don't get big heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: things let's say i have sticks or corn
cobs or something in here um then i have
[SPEAKER_00]: uh they may not blow away because they're
actually heavier than the seed or a stick
[SPEAKER_00]: may stand upright and fall down through
the column of air so one simple way that
[SPEAKER_00]: was done to get things that are grossly
larger quite a bit bigger than the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: itself was a scalping reel and this
basically is just a rotating wire reel and
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds being poured through this thing
from the top while it rotates slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: conveys the large product like corn cobs
or stocks or something off the top it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a rough de-sticking type process but
that combination helps substantially they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be in all the corn plants i see
them a lot in soybean facilities now for
[SPEAKER_00]: removing pods that give them trouble
otherwise okay um then here's an old
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram of a small cleaner usually there's
at least two screens just to remove things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are again too small or too big and
some small machines here with just
[SPEAKER_00]: different examples of things that would be
done to remove some of those contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: and the components of it again we've
mentioned that there's usually an upper
[SPEAKER_00]: air or some form of a pre-aspiration to
get the light trash there's the scalping
[SPEAKER_00]: screens that are the oversized product
different sifting or grading screens again
[SPEAKER_00]: undersized and finishing up in an
aspiration okay okay what what comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: again this was an example here with
soybeans again those the you can see kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the the light trash that was blown away
to begin with i frequently have students
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me why you know these pods didn't
blow away and well you know up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's basically because they're seeded in
them they're heavy enough that they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't blow away easily we've got you
know undersized material which are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: splits or weed seeds on on a dicot like
soybeans things that we can blow away
[SPEAKER_00]: again low quality and the good there's
still a split here there's some merit to
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional equipment as we'll see
here a little bit later okay seed corn it
[SPEAKER_00]: would look something more like that again
those heavy corn cobs and stocks and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth or it came away on on a scalping
screen and just for fun i threw some flax
[SPEAKER_00]: in here there happens to be some cereal
grains that contaminant left from the
[SPEAKER_00]: combine probably that we were removing as
just due to different size differences and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth okay a few examples of some
cleaners in a seed plant here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: midwest these maybe something resembling
them in one in the middle and it's maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: two stories tall but you get into some
smaller vegetable plants this one happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on the west coast and some other
different variations of what are really
[SPEAKER_00]: lab cleaners but sometimes they're the
primary cleaner for a you know a small
[SPEAKER_00]: facility if you're particularly people
doing the the high value seeds okay when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dealing with a cleaner that we can
have basically round hole screens or
[SPEAKER_00]: slotted screens in different dimensions an
english or metric as well these happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the english dimensions but when you
deal with something like soybeans split
[SPEAKER_00]: removal is the big thing and so they'll
work with whether the slot is parallel to
[SPEAKER_00]: the slope or 90 degrees perpendicular to
the slope is a cross slot and we have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hybrid as well you find in some
soybean plants called a herringbone slot
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really about the the cross slot
remove splits more efficiently but doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get stick so well the parallel slot is
there for the sticks and usually you see a
[SPEAKER_00]: mix of the two any of you i mentioned
heard that there may be some folks doing
[SPEAKER_00]: turf grass you get into small seeds
frequently you may see a wire mesh of
[SPEAKER_00]: either a square or a rectangular mesh of
so many wires per inch and in the cereal
[SPEAKER_00]: grains and a few other things there can be
triangular hole screens using removing
[SPEAKER_00]: things like basically triangular weed
seeds but wild buckwheat or wild morning
[SPEAKER_00]: glory perhaps may come out on something
like that again we'll have a mix of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of screens depending what
the application may be okay again what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing when we're doing hand screen
selection here is running it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: stack perhaps we know something about one
end or the other and so we can basically
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out where to trim the tail on that
bell-shaped curve i like to use various
[SPEAKER_00]: types of mechanical screen shakers this is
bigger than you would probably need it
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll handle up to 28 screens because of
the seed corn applications we get into but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know again trying to remove as much
bad and keep the good okay now we start
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into things that would separate by
various dimensions perhaps more precisely
[SPEAKER_00]: than we could with screens and in this
case we have the things that separate by
[SPEAKER_00]: length which would be an indent or a disc
separator basically seed short seed fits
[SPEAKER_00]: into a pocket and long seed doesn't and as
it spins around it can pick more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: out the again cereal grains are the most
common applications but de-sticking other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops can be important i've mentioned seed
corn sizing sunflowers are frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: sized with things that look more like like
this which is again a rotating cell with
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case contoured holes to help
present that seed to the opening and drop
[SPEAKER_00]: it through there you know hopefully more
consistently and so two different machines
[SPEAKER_00]: with different applications here the main
difference on the the sizing is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the hole that came in here and
okay so when we're dealing with length
[SPEAKER_00]: again it's a short seed and it fits in the
pocket gets lifted the long seed just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps tumbling as it works its way down
through the length of the machine a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be familiar with disc separators i
see them more often in high capacity wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: or rice seed plants but in this case it's
the idea is still the same that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: short seed fitting in a pocket the short
seed is is the pockets are now cast into
[SPEAKER_00]: the sides of a rotating disc and there's a
bunch of these discs maybe 27 of them 25
[SPEAKER_00]: inch in diameter or something down through
the machine and as they spin they lift the
[SPEAKER_00]: short seed away and it gets tossed out the
top basically by centrifugal force either
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these is lifting short from long
they're very common for any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: elongated seed where length becomes
important or perhaps you can't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see the difference you know the width and
the the thickness may be the same so a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen can't actually separate them length
becomes important for those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: applications somebody may be familiar with
some of the european brands that use an
[SPEAKER_00]: offset indent in this case that pocket has
been kind of deformed to one side they're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically trying to mimic some of the
effect that we can get with a disc and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case here's just an example of one
particular brand but the the same concepts
[SPEAKER_00]: exist it's just that that offset pocket
kind of helps lift maybe an elongated seed
[SPEAKER_00]: like many of the grasses or cereal grains
that they would be cleaning over there the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are de-sticking might worry
about reversing cylinders and other things
[SPEAKER_00]: okay here's just one fun application this
came into one of our color sorter
[SPEAKER_00]: workshops and they wanted to get these
dark seeds out of here there were some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds inside it that needed to be
removed from the white lettuce that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had and we had a double of a time getting
it sorted by color but we wound up with
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this and the way i did it
was to take the sample and run it through
[SPEAKER_00]: a small indent and we got something that
very much resembled a color separation one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fun parts here is some of those
weed seeds were actually the bodies of
[SPEAKER_00]: dead insects that were just missing their
wings it wouldn't fall down the chute
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk a little bit more about that on
the color sorter later okay just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on disc separators probably not a
common thing there but the pockets do come
[SPEAKER_00]: in different configurations i certainly
wouldn't worry about all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: designations there but basically there's v
pockets that'll tend to lift spherical
[SPEAKER_00]: things the name comes from vetch r pockets
that tend to lift little cylindrical
[SPEAKER_00]: things the name there again comes from the
from rice and then the square pockets are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually what's de-sticking sunflowers and
other products here's just a quick example
[SPEAKER_00]: of that you can see where they're
basically lifting the sunflower and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the sunflower seeds flying through
the air here one advantage of an indent or
[SPEAKER_00]: a disc separator over an indent is that it
has a lot more pockets okay if you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: physically lift every seed you're not
going to get a seed in every pocket so the
[SPEAKER_00]: more pockets you have the more capacity
you can get and if you're physically
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting all the seed away from sticks you
start to see the discs are very big
[SPEAKER_00]: indents the indent has a better advantage
from a standpoint of adjustment okay you
[SPEAKER_00]: can change the speed and change how much
is being lifted so sometimes i see a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of the two machines for specific
applications okay then we move into width
[SPEAKER_00]: and thickness again this is done with a
precision sizer either the round holes
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to separate by width if you think of
how a seed would be presented to an
[SPEAKER_00]: opening if i if i had a round opening and
this is my seed here basically a round
[SPEAKER_00]: opening if you think of a manhole falling
into it it tends to see the width of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed a slot tends to see the thickness
okay it's going to fall down through that
[SPEAKER_00]: slot neither one of these tends to do
length that's what the previous machine
[SPEAKER_00]: was for so in this case we have again seed
being presented to that round opening for
[SPEAKER_00]: separating by width or to a slot for
separating by thickness and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: typically have a multiple machines in
order to get the desired results okay we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a small sizing stack in my lab as
well as a two-cylinder machine but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a just a series of four single-cylinder
machines that looks something more like
[SPEAKER_00]: this the sizes vary because we can change
them much like you would cleaner screens
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case producing four sizes and
an undersized discard and i want to point
[SPEAKER_00]: out that depending how many sizes we need
if it's sunflowers perhaps they're five
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all done with round or so but
we'll need multiple machines because every
[SPEAKER_00]: machine is much like a screen or a
cylinder it produces overs and throughs so
[SPEAKER_00]: i only have two sizes if i need more then
i have to have a few more machines okay
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of cylinders at each point
depends on capacity this small line here
[SPEAKER_00]: is based on single-cylinder machines but
you know you can find machines with two
[SPEAKER_00]: four and six and then beyond that we put
more machines in parallel and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: complications you get into balancing a
sizer stack i'll just briefly introduce it
[SPEAKER_00]: here but you get beyond the scope of this
presentation it can be a couple hours in a
[SPEAKER_00]: workshop just to talk about sizing
efficiency and how to get consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: results from that these types of things
become important elsewhere in the process
[SPEAKER_00]: you know having you know consistent sizing
not only helps planting but it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: differences on your treating results and
so forth as well much like removing all
[SPEAKER_00]: the foreign material becomes important so
right here i mentioned that a sizing tower
[SPEAKER_00]: in the midwest contains an awful lot of
sizing equipment here's a shot in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger of one floor in a large seed
corn facility here so they do have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinders and selecting those cylinders
beforehand becomes important so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: install them all and then find out you're
wrong and you've got to start changing
[SPEAKER_00]: things so how do we do that again it's
much like picking screens it can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: with flat screens typically i'll see
people get a overall distribution with
[SPEAKER_00]: with the screens and then decide again
what to put in the cleaner and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: undersized removal and then the tougher
part is picking where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: split the sizes so typically they'll split
the width separation first perhaps and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the thickness but that can be done in
reverse it's possible to verify those
[SPEAKER_00]: results with a laboratory batch sizer you
know or other methods there's some optical
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment that's being experimented with
as well this is a little bit less clear
[SPEAKER_00]: cut than just the cleaner okay on the
cleaner we know that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the bad and keep the good in this
case of sizing it's just a question of how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're sizing the good okay so what are we
going to call large medium and small uh
[SPEAKER_00]: flat and round and so there's a little
latitude on that sometimes that varies on
[SPEAKER_00]: the end use what how much variability we
can have for plantability i'm starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see discussion on variability for seed
treatment and sometimes it's purely
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing requirements but we'll see a
different number of different things again
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the batch sizer i talked about we
use this for some lab things and for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: small batches and so forth small lots that
we might run into again overs and throughs
[SPEAKER_00]: so one disadvantage if i need to make four
or five sizes i've got to run through this
[SPEAKER_00]: a few times but it's perhaps easier than
trying to fire up the whole tower and
[SPEAKER_00]: losing the lot in there someplace okay i
mentioned that there's issues related to
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing sizers and so one of the
problems we run into is not only that the
[SPEAKER_00]: the capacity of a round in a slot are
different okay the round has more capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: in the slot as you can see here this this
purple up on top is basically the round
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in capacities and bushels per hour
but the other problem is it also varies
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on a hard on how much falls
through okay so the rated capacity of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sizer is based on 95 falling through so
basically that means five percent are
[SPEAKER_00]: going over the top of the cylinder and
heading you know in with the other product
[SPEAKER_00]: we're basically wrong five percent of the
time but if i push it too fast more
[SPEAKER_00]: product carries over the top if i slow
down i'll get a little higher efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you see here as we if so they're
rating it on 95 percent and then saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the capacity that the manufacturer
says you can get from it your results may
[SPEAKER_00]: vary in a real plant and it also varies on
percent throughs so if you think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between a scalping and a
sifting screen if you have almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything falling through which would be
scalping the bulk of the product goes away
[SPEAKER_00]: right away and there's more time for it to
work its way down through the cylinder and
[SPEAKER_00]: search through the remaining product for
the undersized material but if only a
[SPEAKER_00]: small percent falls through much like it
would on a sifting screen in a cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an awful lot more product on that
screen and you're going to have to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down to give it time to find the remaining
undersized product again so the the
[SPEAKER_00]: complication here has to do with keeping
everything working with at a reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency if you overload one of these
machines you know that efficiency may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be 95 percent i've seen times when
students are running it and it was 60
[SPEAKER_00]: percent which means you know 40 percent of
the product that's in the overs is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually throughs and quality control is
not happy so balancing that and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: getting we even do this in an agronomy
class where we we look at what it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the sizes and then what it takes
to to you know to evaluate what's there
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to get those two numbers to match
okay sometimes what's old is new again if
[SPEAKER_00]: you went back several decades you'd find
seed corn plants would have something
[SPEAKER_00]: called a rocket grater it was flat screens
and kind of a rocking motion and contoured
[SPEAKER_00]: screens that were used for sizing corn and
mostly we see the rotary cylinders because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were more efficient at the sizes for
these large seeds but i do see people now
[SPEAKER_00]: adapting flat screen cleaners for sizing
it's fairly popular due to some concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: on mechanical damage with the rotating
sizers you do have to slow these down
[SPEAKER_00]: typically you start at half capacity of
what it would be for a cleaner and then go
[SPEAKER_00]: from there in order to try to get
acceptable efficiency but you know we do
[SPEAKER_00]: see both of those methods being used
pretty heavily through there okay i
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that soybeans you know are the
other alternative here in iowa and but
[SPEAKER_00]: this same type of machine can be used for
almost any spherical type separation i've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually used them for separating round
fertilizer pellets from grass seed before
[SPEAKER_00]: and some things so if the difference is if
one of the two products is roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: spherical we may be able to get it with
either a spiral or a belt the belt has a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of helical flights and the seeds
being run down by gravity and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: much like running on on a curve on the
highway if you drive around it too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll fly off the round seed basically
tends to fly off the spiral separator
[SPEAKER_00]: flights while the less round product stays
on it and the belt is basically an
[SPEAKER_00]: inclined belt it's sloped in one or two
directions and the product basically rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: across it to make the separation okay
those of you are not familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans these are some of the reasons we
may be concerned about shriveled or oblong
[SPEAKER_00]: seed again typically physiological
problems some pathogens as well that would
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it to not be a nice plump round seed
and perhaps we can separate it by how well
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll roll you can get some of this by air
you can get some with a slotted screen or
[SPEAKER_00]: other things but typically you know the
shape sort here is important and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see some optical shape that's also
developing further but sometimes we see
[SPEAKER_00]: this able to do things we can't do with
the the optical sorting yet okay so just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple examples here these are different
numbers of cores depending on capacity you
[SPEAKER_00]: know one two or four and then i see
multiple machines i've been in some seed
[SPEAKER_00]: large soybean plants that had 48 cores but
we also see them used for small lots you
[SPEAKER_00]: know laboratory samples and so forth and
for just selecting the the right geometry
[SPEAKER_00]: for that core can be important now the
classic problem that i hear from plant
[SPEAKER_00]: operators is their spiral doesn't have
enough adjustment okay it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing away too much or too little and
so one thing that we're seeing people
[SPEAKER_00]: working with are rotary size spirals this
idea is pretty simple it's just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: spinning the core with a small motor and
that basically is used just to adjust to
[SPEAKER_00]: change to adjust the separation we can
change the amount that's being saved or
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown away a four core just has one motor
and a timing belt inside there to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: and just a quick example here this is one
of the two rotaries in our lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy lab this fall we did a virtual
lab for the students due to covet 19 and
[SPEAKER_00]: so i had some footage and so forth of this
but these are the four different speeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that we ran the same basically samples
through and kind of almost a visual bar
[SPEAKER_00]: graph this is a different speeds this is
the basically the the round and the flat
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as we shifted we threw less and
less more and more round out basically and
[SPEAKER_00]: got to a smaller amount of flat and then
this was the the product off of those so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the effect of just changing
the speed and dramatically difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the discards here this
definitely throwing away too much on first
[SPEAKER_00]: of these but getting down to a more
reasonable amount here and then i happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the images from an operator that
we use sometimes for evaluating it
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you wind up having to you know
measure seeds or try to quantify them
[SPEAKER_00]: visually or other things this can take a
picture of it and give us some numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast again this isn't a replicated
trial it was just things from that
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy lab but basically the round seed
off of the 30 rpm the the one that had the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest amount thrown away that's
probably the closest to a realistic
[SPEAKER_00]: separation that basically was our good
seed and this was our bad so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting corn we're getting other
things we're getting what almost looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like a color sort but it's really based on
on shape and how well it'll roll so again
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting idea on what something like
that could be adjusted to do again i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to back up here the idea trimming
that bell-shaped curve if we can you can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust that easily with one knob basically
move the speed up and down until you throw
[SPEAKER_00]: away as much bad and you start to see too
much good in there and you back off of it
[SPEAKER_00]: okay when i work with the food grade
soybean people i see a lot of belt
[SPEAKER_00]: separators for export to japan but in in
simplest form it's just a this draper belt
[SPEAKER_00]: that's down here at the bottom is a single
slope the seeds put in in the middle it's
[SPEAKER_00]: run the belt is running up the hill the
round seeds basically roll down the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: and the less round ones go over the top i
sometimes say that this is much like
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to run down and up escalator if
you're in good shape you can run down the
[SPEAKER_00]: escalator if you're not in good shape
it'll take you over the top okay most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the newer ones i see are sloped two
directions and you'll see that on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide as well but the idea here is that
the seed basically the round stuff can run
[SPEAKER_00]: across the belt the belt is running here
towards the right the round product comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down the flat product comes over and
sometimes we can make some intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: fractions as well the large machines for
food grade beans are basically multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: belts in parallel that's really just about
capacity okay a few samples this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: small single belt unit that we have
running some soybeans at this point it was
[SPEAKER_00]: still on a running gear outside it's in
the facility now but this is one waste
[SPEAKER_00]: basket full of soybean and the output from
it okay so you can see there's a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of flat and oblong and then
progressively more as we get into this so
[SPEAKER_00]: the the round is obviously the good oblong
is probably going to be good for most
[SPEAKER_00]: applications other than the japanese
assure me they don't taste as well the
[SPEAKER_00]: discard you know would be something like
this so you know there could be a debate
[SPEAKER_00]: on something along that line but most
people are definitely going to discard the
[SPEAKER_00]: those the splits that we have down in here
these two sometimes i see a valve or
[SPEAKER_00]: something so they could the operator can
quickly make a decision on those it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: more precise separation than the spiral
but it's larger and more expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: less capacity okay then as we start
dealing with things that would be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrading seed these two are work on
completely different principles but we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see gravity separators and color sorters
we have seven gravities in our facility
[SPEAKER_00]: and three color sorters now but more that
come and visit us during the summer so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of interest in what can be
done for those types of things these are
[SPEAKER_00]: both finishing machines they are normally
toward the end of the line they should
[SPEAKER_00]: never really be ahead of your cleaner but
it's some things that we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into on it we're at a is there a i i got
the chat window off here right now are
[SPEAKER_00]: there any questions maybe anyone that him
or somebody's got questions that i should
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with here before we give you just a
short break um here's the chat okay i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any here's anyone have any
questions we just take a break here while
[SPEAKER_01]: i grab some coffee and we'll continue sure
yeah obviously alan is you know has
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous depth of it information as well
as experience with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping uh systems as well as just all
this different type of equipment so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have something in your own particular seed
company the sorting questions uh he he's
[SPEAKER_01]: he's the one to ask so please feel free to
jump in here while while he at least has a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to rest his vocal cords um let me
just jump in and this this is more of a of
[SPEAKER_01]: a grain question uh you know hemp is a big
thing for us here at cornell and uh so we
[SPEAKER_01]: have an impact hauler which would be a
small commercial scale just and again is
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the hemp hearts out which should be
used as a as a food type of a situation so
[SPEAKER_01]: since hemp grain and hemp seed are about
the same so i got involved in what
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to use and things like that
which we've already purchased a year or so
[SPEAKER_01]: ago the first thing and even with hemp
seed the seed companies are not doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: very good job at all of sizing the seed so
we're getting a fair range there so i feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like one of the first steps i need to do
is to go ahead and to get the size but the
[SPEAKER_01]: main piece of equipment is the impact
hauler so we're using a fosberg unit which
[SPEAKER_01]: would be one of their smaller commercial
size so our challenge is is you know hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: is a oil seed with like 35 oil seed so you
can run this stuff and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of just making an oil seed
cake inside of the of the hauler so i
[SPEAKER_01]: think we just need to be very careful how
fast we're running this thing and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that or else like i said is the seeds
i don't know how close it would be to like
[SPEAKER_01]: a baby soybean or something but but it's a
very high oil and when that you fracture
[SPEAKER_01]: off that pericarp pericarp is just like a
sunflower basically very hard that these
[SPEAKER_01]: things can get you know really just
impacted inside of the impact hauler so so
[SPEAKER_01]: i know you don't work with hemp there i
know i was been slow in getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole hemp thing but but you kind of see
the the grain seed situation that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with and and this okay right two
things are i do wind up with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that have dual use and some some
summers about 30 percent of the people at
[SPEAKER_00]: the workshops are actually doing a food
grade product of some sort but they happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to use much the same equipment as
indicated hemp has been kind of a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: here for me because up until very recently
we couldn't legally bring the stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: iowa you could get into trouble and i i'd
run a blind question off to the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: people and get an email back and big
capital letters that under no way should i
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it to iowa state so we didn't have
you know a write-up in the demoine
[SPEAKER_00]: register or something over it but the so i
it's i can't speak directly to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with it sometimes we had to
physically take machines across state
[SPEAKER_00]: lines in order to run a test and the
hulling i i've done de-hulling on other
[SPEAKER_00]: things when we get into some of the nut
crops and so forth how tough that hall is
[SPEAKER_00]: is a huge difference between different
seeds de-hulling soybeans just requires a
[SPEAKER_00]: handling system typically but something
like this sound in so if you start
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking seeds we've been into some things
for food grade application de-hulling
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton seed which is brutal some other
spelt or something might be an issue as
[SPEAKER_00]: well but usually i wind up trying to take
a light pass and then recirculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: product back through somehow so there may
be some opportunities on that we perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: can discuss that later and maybe there's
some things we can look at to help resolve
[SPEAKER_00]: that problem i don't have a lot of
de-hulling equipment but there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere on campus as well that we can
get to and other potential applications
[SPEAKER_01]: okay all right fair enough anybody else
have a question they'd like to to bring up
[SPEAKER_01]: at this time to alan or you can put it on
the chat just go ahead and and type in
[SPEAKER_02]: anything at this point alan uh this is uh
garrick colman i was had a quick question
[SPEAKER_02]: this summer when we were running wheat and
you're going to get into uh uh gravity
[SPEAKER_02]: tables but i was showing one of the guys
that works for us the difference in test
[SPEAKER_02]: weight going across the gravity way up uh
table from light to dense and i was using
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the handheld moisture tests that
has a test weight and from the light side
[SPEAKER_02]: it was almost a point moisture difference
to the wet side it was going from like 11
[SPEAKER_02]: five to like 12 seven or 12 eight i guess
it was over a point is that pretty common
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's deceiving okay uh you said this
is a handheld moisture meter okay so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just you're you're not you're you
may be pre-weigh a sample or you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: pouring it into a cup and filling it to a
certain point okay um that moisture that
[SPEAKER_00]: meter is based on capacitance okay the
capacitance of seed it turns out that that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be correlated with density and it
can correlate with moisture if you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them together it's a problem um is
an undergrad years ago we managed to prove
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could run uh uh wet corn 25
moisture corn across the gravity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different fractions would read anywhere
from um 14 to 40 off the same lot that was
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be 25 the air oven samples
came back and they were all basically
[SPEAKER_00]: within one percent uh plus minus one but
uh so we were basically fooling the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meter because the density
differences moisture meters are not
[SPEAKER_00]: typically calibrated on at least in the
80s we're not calibrated on density and
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got an idea your machine can be
fooled by the density variation it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely that the that the that you're
really seeing a density difference but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being reflected in the moisture meter
readings as well since it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: compensating for that you will typically
see a difference in density what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: usually looking for here and we'll talk
about more curves but the idea is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: i can get this right here is that we have
lower density product you know toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: light end it's kind of an incline perhaps
uh and then to a more of a plateau with
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher density and uh we're trying to
frequently remove the product that's low
[SPEAKER_00]: density maybe recirculate or do something
else with that intermediate product and
[SPEAKER_00]: then hopefully keep the good and maybe we
have to remove stones or something as well
[SPEAKER_00]: off the heavy fraction but yeah density is
one of the big things when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about gravities i see people frequently
looking at things just visually but
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you'll miss stuff that way if
you do don't see the density difference
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got a couple examples we'll use to do
that um likewise if we don't have time if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get a question in here my email
was at the beginning and it'll be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of this presentation as well so you're
always welcome to email me things as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can help deal with it uh gravities
and color sorters seem to be something i
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a lot the students joke
sometimes that you could wind up the key
[SPEAKER_00]: in my back and i'll start mechanically
telling you about gravities and color
[SPEAKER_00]: sorters so um an important topic in the
business other questions ellen probably
[SPEAKER_01]: will just let you get back into your your
presentation too but uh again start
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about these questions and again
you know there's you can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of experience like i
said what you think is oh well we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture gradient well it's it's like i
said it's confounded with the density of
[SPEAKER_01]: the of the product so that was that's
really really neat insight there so thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you after we did those tests in the 80s um
i was working with uh dr charles herberg
[SPEAKER_00]: at iowa state at the time and uh there's
some more history there but a let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: say later on the moisture meters came out
that uh would take when the moisture meter
[SPEAKER_00]: started taking test weight it's because
they're attempting to compensate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of density differences on that and
we basically just showed how aggravated it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be uh when we were playing with it
um so anyway back to the uh gravities and
[SPEAKER_00]: color sorters things that are upgrading it
and it depends a little bit on you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel frequently see people thinking that
these are somehow interchangeable um
[SPEAKER_00]: because maybe they see the same defect
coming out in either one and it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: what the problem was you know back to
physiology and pathology does it affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the density does it affect the color maybe
it affects both if it affects both we
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to get them with either one
but sometimes density is more important or
[SPEAKER_00]: color can be you know color if i've got
purple stain on soybeans i really can only
[SPEAKER_00]: get it with the color but there's times
when low density seed comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately if it's only low density
humans aren't very good at seeing that so
[SPEAKER_00]: i get into this argument we have an
ongoing debate in the midwest on you know
[SPEAKER_00]: do we replace the gravity with a color
disorder and things and that might make
[SPEAKER_00]: some sense in soybean but for surely that
wheat example you had would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong choice um for that okay um okay
then uh so we'd start talking about uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: have gravity separators and de-stoners
both separate with a fluidized bed to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of differentiate it from an aspirator that
might blow the low density away in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case we're going to float a layer of
fluidized product across and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: float the light from the heavy a de-stoner
is the name implied basically removes the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy product stone soil pads and you know
lumps of dirt or other things that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be in there whereas the gravity provides
more of a continuous range from light to
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy and we get into this decision on
where we're going to cut and try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw away we start talking about
density everything we've talked about here
[SPEAKER_00]: so far is bulk density it's test weight
that's done with a test weight apparatus
[SPEAKER_00]: but then the moisture meters are actually
calibrated against something like this in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to give you that number the bulk
density does kind of in since you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: filling a volume like a pint or a quart
cup for setting a gravity i've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: used coffee cans and weighed them if we
didn't have anything else available but uh
[SPEAKER_00]: particle density tries to remove the void
spaces you know what's the density of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed itself it's a little harder to
measure and uh actually a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: useful in most seed applications we use it
more for research and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what's you know because you can
do it on individual seeds if necessary and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh you can remove the size and shape
effects and there's a term called specific
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity i bring it up here it's it's
really the particle or the seed density
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to water it's just a number
that's greater than or less than one if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's greater than one which is most seeds
it'll it'll sink in water if it's less
[SPEAKER_00]: than one it'll float if it was one it's
the same density as water but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because the term gravity table
or gravity separator actually comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the term specific gravity however on large
seeds the density separation is really
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a weight separation it comes close
to that than it does to specific gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: okay how does this thing work some be very
familiar with it you know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have it boiling on the deck and
so forth but i'm not physically boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: just bubbling but basically i have a
little hypothetical bin full of seed here
[SPEAKER_00]: with airflow straighteners and a fan that
can deliver any amount of air i need if i
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on the fan low maybe i can dry it or
aerate it but i'm not going to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: anything maybe some hulls is i i'm after a
goldilocks point here we want the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's enough air that it starts to
basically become buoyant it'll start to
[SPEAKER_00]: lift and fluidize the product make it act
like a liquid at that point the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: product sinks to the bottom and those
heavy particles displace the light ones
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause a vertical stratification we've
got to get this to happen before we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the separation some air is good but
more is not better if i put too much it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tend to bubble and basically mix
this whole fluidized layer together and i
[SPEAKER_00]: lose the stratification that's why that
they always tell the operators not to use
[SPEAKER_00]: too much air the other problem with
excessive air is it tends to lift the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the deck and you lose friction
with the deck and it's harder to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to climb up the hill i also want to
point out that this whole this type of a
[SPEAKER_00]: separation depends on the interaction
between those two particles so there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: way to gravity separate one seed by this
method and it has an effect on small lots
[SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes you don't have enough product
to cover the deck and so you know we have
[SPEAKER_00]: an assortment of different sizes of
gravity for some of that same reason but
[SPEAKER_00]: other times you physically can't get down
to that small amount quick idea on a
[SPEAKER_00]: destoner and again it's a single slope
compared to a dual slope system much like
[SPEAKER_00]: i saw on belts but the idea here is that
we have a maybe a wire mesh reciprocating
[SPEAKER_00]: deck and it's shaking in such a way that
it will tend to move the seed whatever's
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the deck will tend to move up the
hill the if i put seed on at least three
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds deep but maybe more depending on the
application in the machine and i bring
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow through their perpendicular to the
deck and i basically stratify this okay i
[SPEAKER_00]: get that right amount of airflow i
magically get the goldilocks point of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know where i can stratify the product the
lights on top the heavies are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and they're touching the deck they
get conveyed up the hill uh and the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: basically float downhill much like a sled
on a snowy hill or something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have and they're just floating
downward and uh so they're a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: counterintuitive and the heavy things go
up and light things go down i've had
[SPEAKER_00]: students look at me because they're sure i
lost my marbles or something through and
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case i didn't completely remove
all doubt perhaps but gravity is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look much the same except that now i
introduce another slope this was the
[SPEAKER_00]: second of three olivers that have been in
our our plant but the idea that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be bringing this product you know
across here this is the top view the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest corner is here so the slope that
you saw over here on this cross section is
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically through this diagram okay so as
it's shaking it's tending to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavies and move them up the hill as we
put product on there's about it maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: two degree slope along the length and so
as this shakes it just sort of walks its
[SPEAKER_00]: down a fluidized product has a relatively
low angular repose and so it'll gradually
[SPEAKER_00]: travel down the length of this if i
increase that slope it'll travel down
[SPEAKER_00]: faster the net result is that i get a
range here again from light to heavy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then i'm setting these gates perhaps to
try to decide what to keep and what to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw away okay there's our slope this was
some really bad soybeans that were
[SPEAKER_00]: rejected from for an organic seed lot for
japan but you can see the dark colored
[SPEAKER_00]: seed in here in this case i was pushing
that machine really too fast but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of see a curve that shows up that
curve really should come down more like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and follow this this this part but
you can kind of see where again we're
[SPEAKER_00]: restratify it and we're moving this
product down i'll show you that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more on some brome grass but i want to
point out that this separation is not
[SPEAKER_00]: purely based on density it if if
everything was the same size and shape it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically would be but if it varied if
maybe it's made out of plastic it's candy
[SPEAKER_00]: corn or plastic soybeans or something then
basically the large seeds will sink to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and displace the small ones and
you'll get a size separation if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: shape difference like we have on corn
where you could have flat or plump round
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds the plump ones will tend to go to
the deck and displace the others if you
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that together the separation stuff to
predict sometimes you can get a usable
[SPEAKER_00]: separation but this is one reason that the
seed corn company size product in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant ability is that it does gravity
separate better with at least a few sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: okay i promised you a brome grass slide
this is an older one with a cloth deck
[SPEAKER_00]: running a native prairie grass basically
across so there's a stratification zone
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of see the colors on this
perhaps but we've got to stratify it once
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been stratified the lights will start
to go down and then again this is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large difference in density so you can see
it come down pretty quickly and then
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the light edge i have progressively
heavier product coming out i was also
[SPEAKER_00]: taking some product off the stone trap
here so we had some waste baskets of
[SPEAKER_00]: product here and i shot this picture these
are not stones these are actually product
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been excessively brushed okay
when this product came through it had some
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary threshing going on it would be
rubbed against a you know brushing machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you took the remove the para cart
basically you have just the karyopsis left
[SPEAKER_00]: the kernel inside is what you have here
and then basically light hulls and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting that these hulls were actually
aspirated several times before they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: the gravity and we still had not removed
them the gravity takes them out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easily just a quick example here of what
those look like here's those light hulls
[SPEAKER_00]: only about four percent of these are even
filled but a gravity it's tough for
[SPEAKER_00]: something to stay standing vertically
it'll fall over and then i could separate
[SPEAKER_00]: it that whereas it might fall this way
through the aspiration and again you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the heavy ones that were excessively
brushed they're only about point three
[SPEAKER_00]: percent they're a lot heavier in terms of
test weight than than my hulls would be so
[SPEAKER_00]: there was an obvious solution to take the
choice to remove these you start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into some debatable issues on the rest of
this a couple historical diagrams here on
[SPEAKER_00]: why we use gravities and soybeans and corn
some of that same project i showed you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanical damage concluded that the
biggest single difference in germination
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement for the soybeans was the
gravity table the in corn this was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some 70s era material but there's
some light product and if you could remove
[SPEAKER_00]: this you could basically raise the average
germination the balance of the lot this is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a numbers game because these are
not all dead in this case they were 76 but
[SPEAKER_00]: if what you could remove would slightly
improve the germination of something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this the the numbers are more dramatic
when you get into some of the vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here is some onion seed and this is
upgrading onions okay when you first run
[SPEAKER_00]: onion seed through it you get a lot of
foreign material that comes out but if the
[SPEAKER_00]: germination is not good enough oops we've
got to run it back over the gravity and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut some more and maybe we cut 20 or 30
percent in order to get something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable because the germination is just
not high enough i see the same thing on
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots and some other vegetables but
there's no real color difference here but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look and this is just done with a
little toy gravity practically it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: even a very good separation but my light
is more like uh 23 versus 64 a big gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: i probably would have gotten at least a
little bit of product here off the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know about 80 percent this is just blowing
that up looking at it closer again very
[SPEAKER_00]: little visual difference but definitely a
density difference and uh here's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick shot of some uh the the roll towels
basically looking at the germination
[SPEAKER_00]: sample for the light uh versus uh the
heavy product here um so uh again the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers weren't dramatic but it can see a
difference the density would make in
[SPEAKER_00]: viability okay here's another one that was
interesting not replicated but i have some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice looking sweet corn that came
through and we gravity separated it and
[SPEAKER_00]: separated it by density you know measured
the density differences on this curve that
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about and oops i i realized i
had 25 of the product i'd removed um so we
[SPEAKER_00]: did some things and made it into five and
then blended them back you know a miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of occurred and we came back but got
it back to three fractions and then i
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it'd be interesting to show you
the uh the results from the germination
[SPEAKER_00]: trays so basically from uh light to heavy
this was about 54 percent this is about 90
[SPEAKER_00]: for 94 95 and uh there's a difference in
vigor as well on it now i'm going to warn
[SPEAKER_00]: you the sweet corn and yellow dent are
certainly not the same uh sweet corn tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to have more problems but we had tried
colored sorting this there really was very
[SPEAKER_00]: little visual difference to be had but a
big difference for density okay sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants might come out we had a
cereal grain question here on wheat uh we
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently see uh ergot and wheat or
barley or rye was the classic problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: ergot um i have a lot of time to get into
it today but in food grade products uh
[SPEAKER_00]: google ergotism and uh you'll you'll find
some interesting things um there it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad idea to have this stuff in feed and
food okay and this was looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: separating ergot by density and uh we were
looking at uh in this case is they were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at different lots and basically
the uh what it came out after the cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: is the blue and the percent ergot and uh
the red is the gravity heavy which it did
[SPEAKER_00]: not get to zero but it removed the bulk of
it the gravity lights have a lot of ergot
[SPEAKER_00]: so don't feed that to your neighbor's
horse uh something that effect but uh
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done a uh it can be very very
effective at removing that again sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're getting uh things like ergot or
if we have some of the mycotoxins perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin and corn or peanut if you get
into you know vomitoxin perhaps you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little careful if the overall lot
was not safe for feed and food now we
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate it it can be substantially
worse we see that even aggravated if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: corn going to an ethanol plant because the
uh the fumonacins don't go away they just
[SPEAKER_00]: get basically tripled as far as the
percentage level once the starch goes away
[SPEAKER_00]: so other diseases on corn this was just
showing the effect of sizing and gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: separating so basically have four sizes
here and then gravity lights mediums and
[SPEAKER_00]: heavies and we'll cut to the chase here
but in this research they found that on
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular lot that they were working
with they were getting about 3.2 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the the seed in that particular size
and the lights for the small round but it
[SPEAKER_00]: was about 40 percent of the infected seed
for fusarium so it kind of shows you this
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of sizing and density separation
together well okay when you start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about gravities you'll see different
shapes i mentioned that there's seven
[SPEAKER_00]: different machines with triangular and
trapezoidal and rectangular decks in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lab they have different purposes but i
have to teach people how to run this
[SPEAKER_00]: assortment of different machines the first
thing we look for is which way is the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape going if you overlay the trapezoidal
machine like this one with the rectangular
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the deck motion is in the same
direction it's much easier to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on so perhaps we have a
rectangular deck like the one i've been
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you it's this sort of a shape the
conventional wisdom is that provides a
[SPEAKER_00]: longer travel path for the light seed and
does a more efficient job of separating
[SPEAKER_00]: the light which is usually what we're
trying to remove if we're trying to just
[SPEAKER_00]: get a you know like on a lot of the field
crops or other things if we're after the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy product sometimes we see that
trapezoidal these used to be very common
[SPEAKER_00]: for corn for some historical reasons as
well but longer travel path for the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: again this i see them a lot in the
vegetable plants yet where they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get you know they're trying to salvage
some product from a lot that's perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: inadequate otherwise okay here's an old
video 1988 showing the first oliver that
[SPEAKER_00]: was in our lab running and you'll see some
product again coming in from the top here
[SPEAKER_00]: the inlet stratifies you can kind of see
the lights coming down over here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: arrange from the light up to the heavier
product as this migrates down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: deck if i get brian fisher i believe
through that that's that's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: nightshade berry but we do the same thing
type of thing today with a roasted coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: bean but they'll take off and they'll just
float down here you can see the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: will work its way the reason that's
blinking is not your system it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: short video in a loop so in case you
hadn't seen one of those run okay now we
[SPEAKER_00]: do all the things to try to adjust it we
we have full day or now we were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a two-day workshop on gravities this
year before covid came around but once you
[SPEAKER_00]: separate it there's sometimes the
efficiencies this isn't good enough we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that if we have a range from light to
heavy that you know if if this is good and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bad somewhere in the middle is
intermediate mediocre product and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a question if that's a mix of good and bad
or if it's just mediocre if it's just if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just mediocre running it in circles
isn't going to make it better if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mix of good and bad maybe we can recover
the good so the traditionally we'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply cut it okay you know on small lots
but and i see a few companies that will
[SPEAKER_00]: store that middling and do something else
with it that typically means they have
[SPEAKER_00]: another use for it okay it's you can never
really add it back to the same lot lever
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common thing was much like the
little forsberg you see here where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculated over the deck that was a
trapezoidal deck there's a short travel
[SPEAKER_00]: path for the lights and it wouldn't be
completely separated and by bringing that
[SPEAKER_00]: back around it gave it another chance
basically to separate out i see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that on seed corn small lots and so forth
when you get into the larger volume field
[SPEAKER_00]: crops i frequently see a second gravity
used maybe they bought a big new gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: and they used the older gravity to recover
the middling sometimes i'll see a color
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter or a belt separator used if if you
can imagine like if the only thing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with the middling product was it had dark
seed in it a small color sorter might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to recover that so biggest thing if
you are recirculating this product try to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the amount that's recirculating
i've been to plants for 50 of the product
[SPEAKER_00]: from the gravity is running back over the
same gravity the gravity is overloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not doing a good job maybe it should
be 10 or 15 percent that depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: application but you can definitely overdo
recirculation okay any any gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: separator questions while i'm here i can
assure you there's plenty of slides but uh
[SPEAKER_00]: are there other things that we should
cover here we had a good test weight
[SPEAKER_00]: question before
[SPEAKER_00]: if not i'm going to go ahead and plow into
color sorters um again probably a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less of this i don't know how many of them
are out there in your market we see plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of them going into corn plants and they're
gradually going into soybean plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well the first ones i did were actually
for popcorn food grade product again
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get things out for retail i
frequently show things like these rejects
[SPEAKER_00]: they accept and rejects are actually the
two streams off of a color sorter is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily good and bad but usually the
rejects are the bad the junior high kids
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell me these are gross and they
would never want them in their package at
[SPEAKER_00]: the store so you can see why there was an
advantage to sorting that product up front
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign material is the other big reason
for popcorn but there's happens to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sataki and what were sortex or bueller
machines here i have several of those in
[SPEAKER_00]: our lab the other machines tend to visit
so you're going to see those more often in
[SPEAKER_00]: this but uh you know that isn't a certain
endorsement or disadvantage of one or the
[SPEAKER_00]: others i have lots of pictures of other
slides but not enough time to show them
[SPEAKER_00]: all okay um so when we're dealing with
color sorters we're dealing with some
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction of light you know we dealt
with gravities you know on density and
[SPEAKER_00]: screens with size or perhaps but you know
you can have different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: electromagnetic spectrum and uh in this
case perhaps most of it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: visible light because that's what we can
see it's also going to be reflected light
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're looking at the surface
of the seed you're seeing light reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: from that surface and so if we're trying
to get discolored defects that's we want
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar but i do see translucent
sorts occasionally where the light goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through it we're basically handling it i
see a fair amount of near-infrared at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point that's primarily foreign material
removal but that's an area where seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: the machines are evolving pretty fast
there's been a few uv machines that would
[SPEAKER_00]: use a fluorescent type sort as well but
we'll focus mostly on visible today and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may remember from high school physics
that if you had a prism you could separate
[SPEAKER_00]: visible light like what's coming from the
window over here into different colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: those correspond to different wavelengths
of light so we can pick a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength perhaps and you know accentuate
the contrast and then use combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: them to improve our separation we're
dealing with something in color separation
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a light and dark it's not always
as easy as this one i like to joke with
[SPEAKER_00]: the students here that we've got a seed
identification quiz that happens to be
[SPEAKER_00]: roasted in green coffee beans when that
lot came in it was 1200 pounds of it i've
[SPEAKER_00]: had upwards i've had coffee beans in about
six times the biggest lot was 5000 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: so our idea of a sample is a bit bigger
than the rest of the building but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually an interesting separation that
smells great going through the tower we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get discolored seed because that's
what we're doing it it's rarely ever this
[SPEAKER_00]: clean cut okay usually you need something
much more subtle broken seed depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: whether there's actually a color
difference i've seen where you could maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up a shadow you know off shriveled
seed but these a straight color sorter is
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking for color differences it
doesn't really see density but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you can remove low density if it's awful
also discolored if there's an overlap in
[SPEAKER_00]: those two curves this is one example where
gravity will give you almost a straight
[SPEAKER_00]: line because there's a huge difference in
the density of those two products on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roasted is a lot lighter moisture has been
removed but the then maybe we finish up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a color sorter or you can do it all
in a color sorter but it'll take several
[SPEAKER_00]: passes okay if it's a 50 50 mix is what
that was okay so couple quick seed
[SPEAKER_00]: examples here this is soybeans if you
don't happen to run across those in your
[SPEAKER_00]: territory but very colorful product is one
reason i see people trying to use just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they'll use like a cleaner and then a
spiral or a belt and a color sorter
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps but you can see some of the purple
stain in here it's a physiological defect
[SPEAKER_00]: but immatures other things i've had
students joke that they were going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a little fancy bottle and tie a
ribbon around it and sell it at walmart
[SPEAKER_00]: might bring more than the seed but farmers
market perhaps but in corn we're typically
[SPEAKER_00]: removing darks or maybe some brights which
is tricky because there's bright parts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the yellow dent corn as well in iowa we
have lots and lots of yellow dent pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around and during the summer and
so one common thing we have if it's other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of corn classes of corn we can be
frequently removing yellow dent from white
[SPEAKER_00]: corn or from red corn or from blue corn or
orange corn whatever other kinds of corn
[SPEAKER_00]: we might have out there because they've
been cross-contaminated with the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: dent pollen another big advantage i
mentioned that a gravity can't run very
[SPEAKER_00]: small lots because he can't cover the deck
adequately a color sorter can
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically color sort individual seeds
okay so we're looking at actually a small
[SPEAKER_00]: lot here this they would use these for
breeding applications but to prove that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the student doing this for three years
was running 800 to a thousand of those
[SPEAKER_00]: lots through a color sorter that we tweak
for small lots and could do it more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently than he could do it
individually okay we had a wheat question
[SPEAKER_00]: before this is separating white and red
classes of wheat for breeding application
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe only five bushels total but trying
to get it as close as possible to pure
[SPEAKER_00]: okay sunflowers we're dealing here with
taking a black seed out of a black defect
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases so this was a case where
near-infrared because they use both
[SPEAKER_00]: visible light and near-infrared and
sometimes a few more combinations the bane
[SPEAKER_00]: of this is usually something called
sclerotia it's a black defect that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time it reaches the color sorters the same
size and shape and density is this itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and so and it's kind of bad and
confectionary and for pathological reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: as well but can be removed with reasonable
efficiency okay and then you can also get
[SPEAKER_00]: spot defects this was it's a long story
here but basically we're picking out seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that had little bug bites that
subsequently became moldy and we could
[SPEAKER_00]: kick those out as long as the product is
presented towards the camera a color
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter typically has a camera at front and
rear view if it's turned sideways it may
[SPEAKER_00]: not see that okay so a couple quick
examples i mentioned i i could show you
[SPEAKER_00]: slides quite a while here but uh the the
larger versions of the sortex machines
[SPEAKER_00]: that i've shown you look something more
like this uh to where we might have and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone to led lights instead of
fluorescents that used to be in most of
[SPEAKER_00]: them the sataki machines the monochromatic
machines like more like the upper right
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to see some rgb machines which
is really kind of the trend in the
[SPEAKER_00]: business here right now i want to bring up
just a few things to talk about uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know as far as how these things work this
i'm going to go a little bit quick here so
[SPEAKER_00]: bear with me to try to get closer to lunch
but uh the uh here's just an older sortex
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and a cross section of that so
basically you have a feeder on top you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a shoot that basically accelerates
and singulates the product as it goes down
[SPEAKER_00]: past in front of the cameras and we
basically try to look at it in the front
[SPEAKER_00]: rear view and then based on the signal
there's air ejectors that fire at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically blow the rejects out which are
normally the bad seed so you wind up with
[SPEAKER_00]: two streams of rejects and accepts okay
there's three things that any color sorter
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do basically it's got to convey the
product past the cameras properly at a
[SPEAKER_00]: single stream so it can see them all and
there's some issues on trying to go fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to get capacity and spaced far
enough apart to get an efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: separation without losing too much yield
we have to detect it and that's where one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the subsequent slides here gets into
the ability to tell the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: good and bad and then compare that signal
to something that tells the thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove it and so timing of those air
ejectors is another thing that we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit about during the workshops
okay this next one gets a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: involved but there's a signal on the older
ones it's a voltage but there's a signal
[SPEAKER_00]: based on on on the intensity how dark the
product may be and you'll see here
[SPEAKER_00]: machines being called monochromatic
bicromatic or rgb and i just want to help
[SPEAKER_00]: explain that if you've got someone talking
to you about the differences in machines
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes a difference in what they
can separate the traditional machines had
[SPEAKER_00]: basically one signal we get back to my
bell-shaped curve they would try to center
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of that bell shape curve that's
the relative lightness or darkness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: good product some's a little darker than
the others they put that in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another probability curve
basically for the dark defects or the
[SPEAKER_00]: light defects and then there's one number
that basically can be adjusted to tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: how much dark to remove if you raise that
too much you start to carve into the good
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and likewise a light sort they were
some machines that did an independent sort
[SPEAKER_00]: it's basically like having two color
sorters one after the other basically if
[SPEAKER_00]: it saw it in dark or if it saw it in light
then it might remove it and there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations this has kind of gone away to
be replaced with what was called a
[SPEAKER_00]: bicromatic or the next step will be the
rgb machines a bicromatic machine allows
[SPEAKER_00]: it to look at the interaction of those two
things so that in addition to saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dark and one and light and the other
or you can say that you can you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at combinations thereof basically red
versus green or red versus blue were
[SPEAKER_00]: common visible spectrum ones red versus
infrared is harder to show on a powerpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: slide the some of the one of the ones i
have basically has these trip lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used to box in the good seed and
any defect that goes outside of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: box basically tries to be removed the
newer machines you started to see ovoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically surround the good seed and
then there were defect perimeters around
[SPEAKER_00]: here so they were different like these are
brights these are darks maybe on this up
[SPEAKER_00]: here on red versus green i might have some
kind of reddish type seeds or green
[SPEAKER_00]: immatures or something you know down on
this side and so we can have different
[SPEAKER_00]: defect classes color defect classes that
we can have individual sensitivities for
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't take too much to figure out
that if i can plot red versus green or red
[SPEAKER_00]: versus blue that i could do red green and
blue in a cube and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional color map which is
really the way the rgb machines are going
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every new visible spectrum machine
i see come on the market today is is an
[SPEAKER_00]: rgb okay or some more advanced things okay
then the other thing you'll typically see
[SPEAKER_00]: people talk about doing a shape sorting i
mentioned this kind of in context contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: to the spirals but this is a
two-dimensional profile it depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed is oriented but usually you can
look for area it works better on things
[SPEAKER_00]: like soybean than it does on corn that
could fall this way soybeans being roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: spherical makes it a bit easier area and
length are usually pretty useful maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: circularity depending on product
presentation but it's definitely an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving area happens quite a bit i
mentioned that in gravities we sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: resort the middling on color sorters this
is back to my infamous coffee a single
[SPEAKER_00]: sort might not get there by itself and so
we have to go at it again we frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculate either the good or the bad
product depending on what it is more often
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to recover good from the
reject in a commercial plant here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: midwest so i'm going to show you just a
couple quick examples at the workshops we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into more detail on various
configurations but the idea here was there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a four module machine run in the
primary product the rejects were then
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the single module machine the
smaller one over here and recovering the
[SPEAKER_00]: good seed from the reject so here's just
an example of what that would look like in
[SPEAKER_00]: a soybean facility so we basically have a
kind of a there's a couple of handling
[SPEAKER_00]: systems happening here but basically we're
sorting at the first time this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate product that's then being
sorted again the accepts from the the
[SPEAKER_00]: resort are going down here and you still
see that there's some defects there that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gets blended back with the
incoming product give it a chance to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these remaining darks back out of there at
the end of the day this is basically our
[SPEAKER_00]: discard over here our good seed is over
here these two in the center are just
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate products that kind of whirl
around within the process okay big problem
[SPEAKER_00]: again we talked about like measuring test
weight on a gravity you know how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: tell if a color sorter is doing its job
you typically have to you know look at
[SPEAKER_00]: things look at samples so i wind up being
very interested in you know automating
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this thing trying to to be
consistent you know humans aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent from one day to the next or one
operator the next so we're gradually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more work with optical imaging to try to
help make a better tool that gets results
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly for that so with that as we
start we've kind of got through our
[SPEAKER_00]: separation part i want to just mention
again i i promised dr taylor there'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: one treater slide i have some more that
are hidden here but this isn't one i put
[SPEAKER_00]: in years back i have happened to be back
there doing some training but basically we
[SPEAKER_00]: wind up most of the traditional treatments
were put on for pathogen protection
[SPEAKER_00]: there's various things that can be done to
improve improve planner performance we get
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of the specialty seeds you see
more buildup or pelleting occurring some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is gradually migrating into the
field crops as well but this happened like
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar beets a be an example where they'd
make them more spherical or canola where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd make them larger in a rape seed so
they plant a little bit better but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hear a lot more of that from
peter marx this afternoon and again the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole business on on treating you know to
get good results from your treater
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes proper preparation is important
we talked about how we have problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed plant if that combine operator
didn't do his job or if the seed came in
[SPEAKER_00]: it was moldy because it wasn't dried
properly when we start talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: treating if we leave a lot of foreign
material in there some of your treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stick to that dust and dirt
that's in there and instead of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: you're more likely to get dust off there's
going to be problems that occur because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that so we want to get a nice clean
product to the treater before we go on to
[SPEAKER_00]: it the pelleting gets to be an interesting
example we got into some things with some
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seed we're removing little hairs
from the flower but they didn't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a problem because they don't germinate
well it turns out that when they pellet it
[SPEAKER_00]: the little hairs would also get pelleted
and they look just like a seed when they
[SPEAKER_00]: got to the seed lab and they would try to
plant them and by removing the little
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs before they pelleted their
germination results went up which was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of an interesting story so with that we
get into you know different packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: again beyond the scope of this but various
things may happen from little foil bags to
[SPEAKER_00]: large bulk bags or even true bulk out here
winds up in the warehouse and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: proper storage conditions again are
important to deliver you know good product
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could be subject for another
presentation someday so with that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: leave you read through some of this oops
sorry back up I didn't intend for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: read it that fast are there any questions
I can deal with here quick before I show
[SPEAKER_00]: you one more slide and then finish up here
for the credits did we put everyone to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep we talked about efficiency and you
know like a batting average so if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to kill cure insomnia are we at a
hundred percent is there anyone that's
[SPEAKER_01]: still awake well I'm awake Alan all right
okay appreciate this this stuff helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: that this it doesn't date but no please
feel free anybody you know as an attendee
[SPEAKER_01]: to the you know this this is a font of
information and a lot of information but
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a question or you put it in
the chat again Alan is is the person and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to talk a little bit more
about the short courses then before you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap up okay we'll go to this one this
well we actually have something called a
[SPEAKER_00]: short course it was virtual this year but
the workshops this is my perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic schedule we put together for
2021 there's at this point a still high
[SPEAKER_00]: probability I have to turn this into a
virtual program or something we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: cancel these last year and we put some
other things together it gave us an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to put some other content and
we've been gradually working on better
[SPEAKER_00]: ways kind of like a little bit of what
you're seeing here today better ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver you know information remotely but
at least there's the type of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we would typically go through I promise to
give you email address and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for it we typically try to
formalize these dates by the Austin
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting in Chicago which is next week and
also virtually but I'll share at least
[SPEAKER_00]: some you know what we we think are going
to be the dates if the if the COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: situation improves where people can
physically visit us on campus otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: you can watch that website and hopefully
something else or show up or drop me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email again appreciate your patience here
today we'd love had like you saw on the
[SPEAKER_00]: poster it's kind of neat when people can
physically come there but the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: remote delivery is sometimes that we spend
less time on airplanes and maybe a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: audience so appreciate that opportunity
and that I'm gonna I promised doctor I can
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to this if we need but promised
dr. Taylor we'd show this at the end for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you that might need some credits
right good any questions while that's up
[SPEAKER_01]: there yeah this is your opportunity with
with Alan and again his large array of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and experience with so many
different seeds and working with so much
[SPEAKER_00]: different seed cleaning equipment now it's
a hump some sometimes it's a case where
[SPEAKER_00]: you know an awful lot about a very narrow
field we know I've been I've spent my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole career pretty much around seed
plants and you know some food grade what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call food grade seeds like you know the
popcorn dry beans are real grains this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of thing very little in in the
commodity grain okay I haven't done a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: with that I get to some of those
facilities I've refurbished a few of them
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know in the 22 years out there
working you know designing plants now I
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly talk about them but we see a much
more diverse array of different seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: know hopefully at some point we can bring
the hemp seeds in and help answer those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions better but chestnuts hazelnuts
Iowa ones that are being domesticated I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean a lot of funny things wander through
our facility again a small part of a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different plants sometimes learning
something and for instance we've done some
[SPEAKER_00]: work I didn't show you here with with with
Circus but it turns out that many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: methods we had developed for flax work and
so you can kind of build on what you
[SPEAKER_01]: learned okay okay well this this does take
us to noon and again I want to thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: and give you a nice thumbs up for your
presentation and a virtual clap in there
[SPEAKER_01]: is well so I really really appreciate Alan
again such such an excellent presentation
[SPEAKER_01]: with so much information provided I think
I have to go back and listen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: recording sometime just to pull out some
some individual information where you were
[SPEAKER_01]: going talking about some of the equipment
so again thank you so much all right well
[SPEAKER_00]: again I'm gonna give you a thumbs up on
your end it's it's a neat opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach we get some people in from various
companies up there doing pumpkins doing
[SPEAKER_00]: organic white corn and things like this
you know some flint corns and stuff have
[SPEAKER_00]: come in samples and so forth and we've
we've some small family-owned companies
[SPEAKER_00]: have been out one of their sons came out
and came to Iowa State after a workshop so
[SPEAKER_00]: he's now an agronomist that's working for
one of the seed companies so it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: neat opportunity for collaboration and
much appreciate that so okay like for me
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another hour till lunch but you
know so I could stay on but I suspect if
[SPEAKER_00]: you you've got other things that you'd
like to do and I would you know recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to catch that presentation at one
and some of the others later this
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon will get more into product and
performance but the the equipment part you
[SPEAKER_00]: get into treating and things that affect
those results you know should be covered
[SPEAKER_00]: and for you know a range of seeds but that
are not probably just corn and soybeans
[SPEAKER_02]: there either yeah thank you this has been
a production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_02]: web at Cornell edu you
