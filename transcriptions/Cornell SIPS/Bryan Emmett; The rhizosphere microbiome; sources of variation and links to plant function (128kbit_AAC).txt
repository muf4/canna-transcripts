[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, everybody, for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice to be back in the
horticulture department.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just down the road now at DTI,
but nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_03]: We aren't a department anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: This section, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started in 2009 when departments still
existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be back and to see familiar
faces and to have the opportunity to share
[SPEAKER_04]: my PhD work with you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like to start these talks on the
rhizosphere microbiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to start with a technical glitch
and then move on to thinking about why we
[SPEAKER_04]: think about the rhizosphere and the plant
microbiome in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, much of this is focused around
the story of nitrogen in agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, it's a plant-limiting
nutrient in most of our terrestrial
[SPEAKER_04]: systems, certainly in agricultural
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the application of nitrogen to our
agricultural lands has enabled a really
[SPEAKER_04]: steep increase in the yields of those
lands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: average yields have gone up over the last
century, so has nitrogen application gone
[SPEAKER_04]: up for much of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to enable continued gains
in productivity as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a cost to some of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when nitrogen is applied in excess or
when it leaves those agricultural lands,
[SPEAKER_04]: even the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide,
it can also enter the waterways,
[SPEAKER_04]: lead to eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a picture of the hypoxic
zone in the Gulf of Mexico, a result of
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient loading in the Mississippi River
Basin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the challenge of crafting
sustainable systems in the future is how
[SPEAKER_04]: do we maintain that plant productivity
without loading these environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: externalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rhizosphere is a really exciting
object to study in this regard because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a hot spot of nutrient and nitrogen
cycling in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this nutrient cycling is really driven
by the fact that the plants release about
[SPEAKER_04]: 3% to 30% of their fixed photosynthates
into the rhizosphere, either as plant root
[SPEAKER_04]: exudates or rhizodiposites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this carbon flow enables a microbiome
that is really distinct from bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's both more abundant, more active,
and different in composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only is the composition different,
but we also see that some of the process
[SPEAKER_04]: rates are different as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we often see increased rates of
decomposition in the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_04]: associated nitrogen mineralization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the estimates are as high as 10
times the amount of gross nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: mineralization occurring in the zone
around plant roots is in bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a substantial nutrient flow
that might be available for the plant to
[SPEAKER_04]: take advantage of and that plants and
their microbiomes may be able to tap into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I find also exciting is not only
is this compartment different from bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, but we see variation between plants,
plant species, and even plant genotypes in
[SPEAKER_04]: their impact on this environment,
the composition of the microbial community
[SPEAKER_04]: there, and some of the process rates that
we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in a horticulture department,
this is an interesting point of
[SPEAKER_04]: intervention that we can have in these
managed landscapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can choose plants that harvest a
beneficial microbiome, then we may be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to manage that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may be able to manage some of these
processes in support of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But while we know that there's some plant
variation in this environment,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the microbial community that resides
there, we don't have a good handle on or a
[SPEAKER_04]: good predictive framework for
understanding which plants are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have which effects on the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of my main research questions
is trying to get a handle on at least in
[SPEAKER_04]: the types of plants that we put into
agricultural fields, what might be some
[SPEAKER_04]: sources of variation in their rhizosphere
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we're interested in plant
resource acquisition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so are these impacts on the
rhizosphere bacterial community
[SPEAKER_04]: composition, its metabolism, are they
linked with differences in plant growth
[SPEAKER_04]: and nitrogen uptake in the field?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, I'll end on a story
looking back and asking the question of
[SPEAKER_04]: has modern breeding altered these
relationships?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has modern breeding influenced rhizosphere
composition or function?
[SPEAKER_04]: As we've bred plants for our agricultural
landscapes, have we changed these
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions in any way?
[SPEAKER_04]: The way we address these questions,
and this will hold true for all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments that I shared today,
is a basic common garden type experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we take a range of plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We plant it in the same environment under
the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can see how the plant genetics
change the phenotype that we're interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first experiment that I'll share
with you, we focused on maize and a
[SPEAKER_04]: handful of C4 grasses, but also some
broader diversity, including some dicots
[SPEAKER_04]: and legume as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this allows us to do is to test
things like is plant phylogenetic distance
[SPEAKER_04]: related to the microbial community,
differences in the microbial community
[SPEAKER_04]: between these plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are plants that are farther apart on this
phylogenetic tree also differing more in
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbial community?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some indication that this
holds, both in the rhizosphere of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Boise and in the mammalian gut microbiome,
that evolutionary history of the organisms
[SPEAKER_04]: play a role in the microbiome and shaping
their microbiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it hasn't really been tested in the
field for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, these plants are also
distinct in other ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a handful of crop plants
with large growth potential, sorghum,
[SPEAKER_04]: maize, sunflower, some agricultural weeds
that are highlighted in orange,
[SPEAKER_04]: which have a different life history
strategy perhaps, and then even a legume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so another hypothesis would be that
plants that are functionally similar,
[SPEAKER_04]: that share similar growth characteristics,
may have similar effects on the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plants that are further apart may have
more disparate microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I said, we plant these out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use replicated monocultures,
shown in the upper right-hand corner here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We maintain weed-free bare soil control
plots so we can compare the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: samples that we're collecting to soil
that's not under the influence of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we split these plots with a
nitrogen application of 0 or 95 kilograms
[SPEAKER_04]: of nitrogen per hectare to assay the plant
characteristics and the rhizosphere traits
[SPEAKER_04]: under conditions of severe inlimitation or
greater in availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we sampled all of these plants at
flowering time, which is an important
[SPEAKER_04]: distinction that you'll hear more of as
this talk goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did that because there's increasing
evidence that as plants go through their
[SPEAKER_04]: phenology, their rhizosphere impacts are
changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so rather than sampling all these
plants at the same time, we decided to set
[SPEAKER_04]: the phenological stage of flowering and
sample them all at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We harvest the above-ground portions of
the plant to measure biomass, nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, we can calculate nitrogen use
efficiency, which for us is a very broad
[SPEAKER_04]: definition of just the amount of carbon
that the plant can fix for the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen that it takes off from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We dig the plants up, and we collect soil
from around the roots as well as intact
[SPEAKER_04]: roots and adhering rhizosphere soils for
profiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're profiling the bacterial community,
and we're using a 16S rRNA approach for
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then collect the soil as well for a
lab-based assay of microbial community
[SPEAKER_04]: activity, an extracellular enzyme-based
assay, so we can get an idea of microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolism in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing to note, and I mentioned
that flowering time is going to be an
[SPEAKER_04]: important thread through this section of
the talk, is that when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant traits that we measure,
not surprisingly, how long these plants
[SPEAKER_04]: grew is the major source of variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were looking for functional
variation in the plants, and how long
[SPEAKER_04]: they're in the ground for, how long they
take to flower, is the major dimension of
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so flowering time, whether it's
biomass, or here I'm showing an uptake,
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering time describes most of the
variability in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: These extracellular enzymes, for those of
you who aren't aware or just a reminder,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are extracellular enzymes that are
produced by microbes released into the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, breakdown organic macromolecules,
cellulose, lignocellulose, protein,
[SPEAKER_04]: chitin, releasing monomers that are
available for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the process, liberating nitrogen and
phosphorus for the microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if those microbes die or turn over,
those nutrients may be available for the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so a light show too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so measuring these enzymes with this
assay, we can get a picture of microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: allocation in soil to these different
pools of carbon that are available,
[SPEAKER_04]: or carbon and nitrogen, in the case of the
lower two, that are available to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can measure the same thing in the
rhizosphere, and we can see this
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere effect that I was alluding to
earlier, an increase in the activity of
[SPEAKER_04]: these exoenzymes in the rhizosphere soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the 16S rRNA profiling, we're
essentially, we're collecting these roots
[SPEAKER_04]: from the fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking intact roots in rhizosphere
soil, extracting the DNA, amplifying a
[SPEAKER_04]: portion of the 16S rRNA, the B4 variable
region, and then sequencing that on the
[SPEAKER_04]: aluminum iSeq instrument.
[SPEAKER_04]: We run that through a bioinformatics
pipeline where we're demultiplexing
[SPEAKER_04]: through a quality control, and then we
cluster those at 97% similarity among the
[SPEAKER_04]: sequences to form what we call operational
taxonomic units, which are just what we
[SPEAKER_04]: think of as taxa in this data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that gives us two forms of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have essentially species lists that are
occurring in each sample and the relative
[SPEAKER_04]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can take those and calculate
dissimilarity matrices, which is comparing
[SPEAKER_04]: each sample to each other, how close is
the composition in one sample to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll share both types of data with you
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is taking that distance matrix,
ordinating it, showing it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: two-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, each dot represents a
microbial community, a sample of the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those dots which are closer together are
more similar in the composition of that
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those which are further apart are more
distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right off the bat, there's a very
strong rhizosphere effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: On bacterial community composition,
these triangles are all bare soil plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these dots, and you can see a
very clear separation and a wide
[SPEAKER_04]: separation between the rhizosphere samples
and the bare soil samples, explaining
[SPEAKER_04]: about 25% of the variation in the data
set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the same ordination color the same
way, but the color coding is actually the
[SPEAKER_04]: day we're sampling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'm highlighting here is that
what day we go out and we collect these
[SPEAKER_04]: samples influences about 33% of the
variation in the data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that variation is driven largely by
the rhizosphere samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: So flowering time, as I mentioned,
is very important as far as the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics that we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also find it's very important in the
actual composition of the community in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, we can control for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can see what amount of
variation we can partition to the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: genome type or species effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see about another 20% of that
variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plant genotype and species is having a
substantial influence on the microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the color dots in this one are just
indicating different species or genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to be able to make
sense of that range of color dots right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look, you can see these light
green ones separating here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some light blue ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can pick it up visually as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in contrast, something like
fertilization in the rhizosphere really
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't having that great of an influence on
the microbial community that we measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's statistically significant because we
have a very large end when we're running
[SPEAKER_04]: this test.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's only about 1% of the variation
that we're observing can we attribute to
[SPEAKER_04]: the nitrogen fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of where I started the
talk is that we know that there's this
[SPEAKER_04]: variation between species and genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we want to know what leads to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another way of looking at that here on
the y-axis, as you can think of as the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in microbial community
composition, we're using a weighted
[SPEAKER_04]: unifrac measure for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that takes into account both the
composition of the bacterial community,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also the phylogenetic relationships
within that community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the y-axis is the days between
harvest for each sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we see is a positive
relationship between time of sampling and
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbial community composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those samples that are collected further
apart are more likely to be distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those samples which are sampled on similar
dates more likely to be shared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the largest source of
variation in our data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we can control for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can look at the same thing looking
at plant evolutionary distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we used chloroplasts, RBCO,
and metcadenes to reconstruct the
[SPEAKER_04]: phylogeny of these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see a positive significant
relationship with the weighted unifrac
[SPEAKER_04]: distance measurement, essentially saying
that plants that are more distantly
[SPEAKER_04]: related are more likely to have a
microbial community in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: that's more distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's much easier to visualize
when we sort of bin it in the groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we take it from the same genotype
versus within a species, within a family,
[SPEAKER_04]: or between families, we're more likely to
get samples that are distinct in
[SPEAKER_04]: composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to dive in and look at some
of the functional differences between
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and what were the effects on the
microbial community that these variables
[SPEAKER_04]: were having.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is another ordination,
but some of you may be familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: redundancy analyses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, what I'm doing is I'm
constraining the ordination to only show
[SPEAKER_04]: that variation in the microbial community
that is explained by these four
[SPEAKER_04]: explanatory variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're showing you a subset of the
variation and the relationships among the
[SPEAKER_04]: species and how they relate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we chose these four variables because
days to flowering was the most significant
[SPEAKER_04]: source of variation in the data set,
but also plant nitrogen use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_04]: seed size, and nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nitrogen uptake was what you're mainly
interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the two other variables were also
significant predictors, though I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: show you that data.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we put these together in an
ordination, what we find is that all of
[SPEAKER_04]: these load very strongly on one axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they essentially separate out the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: On one side, we have some wheatier plants,
our barnyard grass foxtail velvet leaf,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as some lower nitrogen use
efficiency plants, crop plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's teff and finger millet in here
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the other side, some longer
lived higher nitrogen use efficiency crop
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, such as maize, sunflower,
and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's this life history
difference that are separating plants out
[SPEAKER_04]: that's related to both their plant traits
and associated with differences in the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial community as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can take the taxa in abundance and then
correlate it with this axis, this first
[SPEAKER_04]: axis of the ordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every dot on this graph is one of
the taxa in the data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those that are gray aren't significantly
correlated with that axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those in red are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their spread to the left or right is
essentially the change in abundance as you
[SPEAKER_04]: move to the right or left.
[SPEAKER_04]: This axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these red dots are positively
correlated with this side of the axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: These red dots are with that side of the
axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what jumps out is that there's very
strong phylogenetic selection on the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a few actinobacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one phylum that's strongly
selected by these long lived high nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: use efficiency plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have a plant life history
difference and some sort of phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_04]: selection on the rhizosphere microbiome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you are familiar,
the actinobacteria are filamentous
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there may be a morphological
selection as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can further overlay some of the enzyme
data that we had and see how that matches
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the three things that I've
highlighted are one, leucine
[SPEAKER_04]: immunopeptidase.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a protein degrading enzyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: NAG is a chitinase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are both carbon and nitrogen
accessing enzyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are negatively correlated with
the axis, which is telling you that these
[SPEAKER_04]: are more active, potentially more active
in these longer lived higher nitrogen use
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are plants that have to be in the
ground for a longer period of time during
[SPEAKER_04]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're putting more resources into grain
for the following season versus some
[SPEAKER_04]: wheatier, shorter lived species that maybe
don't have the same resource demands on
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil or effects on the soil over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also correlated with that axis is
inorganic end contents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can start to see the congruence
between some of the chemical variables,
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbiome, and some of the plant
traits as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to wrap up this initial part,
we see that host phylogeny does influence
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere bacterial community
composition, a small but significant
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we see this relationship in plant
life history strategy with the bacterial
[SPEAKER_04]: community as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope that you're wondering how much
of this is actually influenced by the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that we've selected and their
variation versus just this decision to
[SPEAKER_04]: sample at flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we certainly were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then are these trends actually linked
with patterns of growth and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: uptake that can be separated from these
differences in flowering time?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ran another experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this time we focused in on a subset of
the variation that we assayed in the first
[SPEAKER_04]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used two maze hybrids and then four
species that attempted to encompass the
[SPEAKER_04]: functional variation that we observed in
the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we used buckwheat, forage millet,
Sudan grass, and sunflower as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we planted these in a 20-year organic
fields up in Pinyin in the summer of 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we sampled, instead of sampling
at flower time, we sampled the set dates
[SPEAKER_04]: based on the phenology of maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the vegetative stage, which I'll
show is V6, it's flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_04]: R1, and grain filling.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can now track what are the species
effects versus what are the temporal
[SPEAKER_04]: effects in this data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added a fertility treatment again so
that we could see how these plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: responding to resource availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an organic field, so we can't add
synthetic nitrogen to create this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead we mowed swaths of clover from
the season before and then transferred
[SPEAKER_04]: that off of the low-end plots to the
high-end plots, transferring about 55
[SPEAKER_04]: kilograms of nitrogen per hectare to set
up a fertility treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we measure many of the same things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here is some of the basic growth
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to draw your attention to
the fact that these plants do vary in
[SPEAKER_04]: their growth over the course of the
season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one thing that I want to highlight
is that this is relative growth rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of these plants, the Sudan grass and
the millet, are really maintaining higher
[SPEAKER_04]: rates of growth longer into the growing
season than the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the maize, the sunflower,
and the buckwheat are all decreasing their
[SPEAKER_04]: relative growth rate at a faster pace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Measure nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can see how nitrogen uptake dynamics
changes over the course of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I just want to note that it's at
the flowering time sampling where nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: uptake is at its highest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It peaks for almost all the species at
that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also when it appears that nitrogen is
most limiting from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the bottom panel graphs,
they're broken out by each species.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're also shown the solid lines
show the rate of nitrogen uptake in the
[SPEAKER_04]: plots where clover was removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the dotted lines show nitrogen uptake
in the plots where clover was added.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only at this harvest at flowering
time where we start to see a significant
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in the rate of nitrogen uptake
between the fertility treatments,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is telling us that at this point,
nitrogen supply from soil is limiting,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the fertility treatment is making a
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas it's not limiting either before or
really after for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some enzyme data again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm showing you just the cellulose
degrading enzyme and the protease because
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're the most interesting
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these black dots represent the bare
soil while the colored dots again
[SPEAKER_04]: represent the plant rises here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing to note on the top
panel is that the yellow and the blue dots
[SPEAKER_04]: that represent the maize species or maize
genotypes, they have this strong
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere effect on a cellulose
degrading enzyme early in the season
[SPEAKER_04]: that's maintained through flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that effect really is not observed for
any of the other species that we assayed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there seems to be some species
influence on microbial metabolism in the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil that we can see in our enzyme data.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing I want to highlight is
with the protease, we don't observe a
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere effect early in the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here at flowering where nitrogen
demand is highest across the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: species, there's a positive rhizosphere
effect on potential enzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a reminder, of course,
this is when we see nitrogen being
[SPEAKER_04]: limiting, nitrogen soil supply being
limiting, and nitrogen demand at its peak
[SPEAKER_04]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a synchrony between plant
nitrogen demand, nitrogen supply from the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, and the metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a synchrony between the
rhizosphere and the microbial metabolism
[SPEAKER_04]: in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can dive deeper into this time point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I'm just regressing the
rhizosphere effect on this enzyme activity
[SPEAKER_04]: versus the rate of nitrogen uptake for
those plots or species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see a significant positive
relationship in these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see synchrony temporally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the variation between species and
their effect is linearly correlated with
[SPEAKER_04]: their nitrogen demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we think that these enzymes,
the rhizosphere effect on these enzyme is
[SPEAKER_04]: a mechanism of plant nitrogen supply,
and that this represents nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: mineralization in the rhizosphere,
which granted is a big leap, this data
[SPEAKER_04]: would be consistent with nitrogen supply
that is of result of the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's nitrogen that's feeding a plant
and that's not available for loss from the
[SPEAKER_04]: system or an eventual runoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at the microbial community
data, this is an ordination that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: faceted into three panels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so each of these panels share the same
ordination space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead, only the points that are
shown are from the first, second,
[SPEAKER_04]: and third sampling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here we can see the difference both
over time and between the species in our
[SPEAKER_04]: data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing to note is that
sampling date does have a large effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the rhizosphere effect seems to
be getting stronger over the course of the
[SPEAKER_04]: season and more distinct from bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's explaining about 11% of the
variation in our data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also plant genotype or species is
having a very strong effect too,
[SPEAKER_04]: explaining more of the variation,
even 18%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think most interestingly,
there's this interaction between genotype
[SPEAKER_04]: and sampling date.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 10% of the variations explained
by this interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially what we see in the
ordination is that plants are having
[SPEAKER_04]: divergent effects on the microbial
community over the course of the season,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially shaping the succession of the
rhizosphere microbiome in different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at our first sampling, the
difference between species is really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't really pick it up visually.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you move into the next slide,
into flowering time, you start to see
[SPEAKER_04]: these green points of the sunflower,
that cloud separating up to the upper
[SPEAKER_04]: right-hand quadrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sudan grass, these red points beginning to
separate down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the third sampling, millet,
Sudan grass, sunflower, and maize,
[SPEAKER_04]: all really in their own portions of the
ordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only is species having an influence
on the microbiome, but it's affecting the
[SPEAKER_04]: succession of that community as well.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise this will be the last of these
that I show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, this is a constrained
ordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at the variation in the
data set that, in this case, is correlated
[SPEAKER_04]: or explained by these other growth
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use a slightly different set of
growth characteristics because we have
[SPEAKER_04]: better measurements in this data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have relative growth rate,
total biomass accumulation, and the rate
[SPEAKER_04]: of nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that nitrogen use efficiency of the
plant carbon to nitrogen ratio metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we see is that these plants
really separate predominantly on an axis
[SPEAKER_04]: that's best explained by differences in
relative growth rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these species, millet, Sudan grass,
occupying one side of the axis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and sunflower and maize occupying another
side of the axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at the correlations with
the microbial community associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: these axis, we start to see a very similar
pattern, some slight differences with what
[SPEAKER_04]: we saw before, but a similar pattern
where, again, the actinobacteria are
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with this group of species,
lower growth rate, but higher biomass
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulation over the course of the
season, and a broader swath of diversity
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with the plants with a higher
relative growth rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are a handful of other things
that are popping up, not just the
[SPEAKER_04]: actinobacteria in this scan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them is a group of
chlorophyxie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I mentioned before that the
actinobacteria are notable for this
[SPEAKER_04]: filamentous lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chlorophyxie, the best hit to the
group that was changing, was this family
[SPEAKER_04]: of the actinobacteriaceae, which is also a
filamentous bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, there's a
Burkholderia, which is a broad genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many plant growth promoting bacteria in
this genus, including some nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: fixers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not surprising to see it in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the fact that we're seeing
this selection on the filamentous
[SPEAKER_04]: lifestyle and this subset of the
actinobacteria now in two different
[SPEAKER_04]: experiments, in two different soils,
two different years, but associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: similar life history traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is notable and probably worth
following up on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what have we learned so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the enzyme data pointed out that
the rhizosphere function is very well
[SPEAKER_04]: coupled with plant nitrogen demand in the
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant species are shaping the
rhizosphere community composition and the
[SPEAKER_04]: successional trends in the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, these were lower relative
growth rate plants favoring a subset of
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbial community dominant by the
actinobacteria and other filamentous
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do I think is going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some work that has looked at
differences among plants and relative
[SPEAKER_04]: growth rate, and particularly how they
maintain that relative growth rate under
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient stress and rhizosphere effects as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they find is a positive
relationship between plant relative growth
[SPEAKER_04]: rate and rhizosphere carbon flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in those plants that are growing
faster, maintaining higher RGR,
[SPEAKER_04]: higher carbon flow, then there's increased
microbial growth and turnover in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere of those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can imagine that our plants
might be on the same axis and that those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that are slowing their relative
growth rate later in the season is
[SPEAKER_04]: mirrored by a decrease in carbon flow in
the rhizosphere and thus a narrowing of
[SPEAKER_04]: the ecological niche that is somehow
favoring the subset of the community
[SPEAKER_04]: versus plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a picture of Teff, a lower
nitrogen use efficiency grass,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that may be maintaining higher rates
of carbon flow and then thus a greater
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity of organisms in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the last thing I want to share with you
today is really it's a means of looking
[SPEAKER_04]: backwards in preparation to look forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is if rhizosphere selections,
associations can be selected and bred for,
[SPEAKER_04]: then it may be possible that indirectly
we've been selecting for certain
[SPEAKER_04]: associations over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're back to this picture of
changing nitrogen use and increasing
[SPEAKER_04]: yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the nitrogen management portion of
this is one component, but also we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding over the course of this 60 year
history in this graph and breeding for
[SPEAKER_04]: improved yields in these environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how is breeding interacted with
changing management regimes and what are
[SPEAKER_04]: the implications on that for the
rhizosphere effects?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can think of sort of a simple
hypothesis would be if we've replaced the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil nutrient flows with additional
externally applied nitrogen fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been breeding for plants that do
well in that system, we may have bred for
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that as the throughout the breeding
history that are better at taking up
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen from fertilizer, but there may be
a cost or there may be relaxed selection
[SPEAKER_04]: on traits that are supporting the plant
gaining soil nitrogen from soil pools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there may be a trade off over that
period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we think about it in terms of microbial
community similarity, if there's a relaxed
[SPEAKER_04]: selection on rhizosphere traits over time,
then plants that are bred and released in
[SPEAKER_04]: similar time periods would be more likely
to have similar microbial community
[SPEAKER_04]: composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas maybe plants that were released
early in the history versus late in the
[SPEAKER_04]: history, maybe more distinct effects on
the rhizosphere microbial community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to test this Pioneer Hybrid
International, now DuPont Pioneer,
[SPEAKER_04]: maintains a collection of their best
selling hybrids from 1936 through present
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they provided us with seed of 12 of
the best selling hybrids sort of spanning
[SPEAKER_04]: this range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we planted those out in another field
experiment at the Musgrave Research Farm
[SPEAKER_04]: in Aurora, replicated monocultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this time we planted them at 0,
85, and 170 kilograms of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_04]: hectare that we can assay their response
and their effects on the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_04]: both at nitrogen limited conditions and
presumably to nitrogen excess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, nitrogen management is not the only
thing that's changed over the course of
[SPEAKER_04]: this history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly planting density is a major
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we used an intermediate planting
density of about 60,000 plants per
[SPEAKER_04]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_04]: That allowed us to maintain nitrogen
limiting conditions, but also our earliest
[SPEAKER_04]: releases could still tolerate it and stand
throughout the season without falling
[SPEAKER_04]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: At higher modern densities, they wouldn't
be able to.
[SPEAKER_04]: This experiment also included a 15N
tracer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that allows us to differentiate,
even under fertilized conditions,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the plants are getting from soil
pools versus applied fertilizer from that
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not actually going to share that data
with you just for time limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can plot the changes,
the yield of these hybrids versus the
[SPEAKER_04]: years when they were released.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can look for trends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what should jump out at you is this is
not the hypothesis that I originally
[SPEAKER_04]: presented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, if we look at both grain yield
and nitrogen uptake, there's positive
[SPEAKER_04]: trends with year of release in both data
sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the modern hybrids are higher yielding
under high nitrogen conditions and under
[SPEAKER_04]: low nitrogen conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not only that, they're taking up more
nitrogen under both conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it seems this breeding history has
actually improved plant resource
[SPEAKER_04]: acquisition under unfertilized conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we look at their rhizosphere,
so another ordination, this is showing the
[SPEAKER_04]: centroids and the standard air of the
samples placement on this ordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we color those by year of release,
here these red points are our earliest
[SPEAKER_04]: releases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these blue points are our latest
releases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you see is they actually line up
very close together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a lot of difference between
the first releases and the latest
[SPEAKER_04]: releases.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some significant differences
between the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are largely driven by the middle
releases, the releases from the 1960s and
[SPEAKER_04]: 70s, which seem to be separating from the
group somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our second hypothesis that the
microbial community is changing,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's been some changes, but not exactly
what we were predicting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this becomes very clear if we look at
differential abundance of particular taxa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is comparing the abundance of all
of our taxa to the abundance in the
[SPEAKER_04]: earliest release.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see no differences, no significant
changes through any of the hybrids except
[SPEAKER_04]: for these middle release hybrids from the
60s and 70s, where we start to see some
[SPEAKER_04]: change in the composition of that
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we look at the enzyme data,
again, there is some variation among the
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids, but it tells a similar story.
[SPEAKER_04]: The modern and the oldest releases are
still rather similar to each other in
[SPEAKER_04]: their enzyme profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's this release from the 1970s,
which is really standing out and is
[SPEAKER_04]: distinct from the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so where are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can reevaluate this idea that maybe
luxury nitrogen has relaxed selection in
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we look back to this graph again,
perhaps once in this period from the 1960s
[SPEAKER_04]: and 70s, where there was rapid increases
in nitrogen applications to agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: lands, perhaps then there was truly luxury
and great end surplus in the systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly over the last 30 to 40
years, those rates of nitrogen application
[SPEAKER_04]: have been stable, and yet yields have
continued to go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nitrogen use efficiency has been
improving.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's possible that, you know,
for a while there was relaxed selection
[SPEAKER_04]: and things have gone back to a stronger
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to claim that with only a
couple of genotypes from that middle
[SPEAKER_04]: period, but it could be interesting to
look more closely at those middle years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, these changes in plant density
that have occurred alongside these changes
[SPEAKER_04]: in fertility management may be maintaining
really strong intraspecific competition
[SPEAKER_04]: for resources and therefore be providing a
stabilizing selection on some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to begin to wrap up, we saw that
rhizosphere bacterial community
[SPEAKER_04]: composition was linked with plant
phylogeny and function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is exciting because it could be a
potential tool for managing rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: communities and the processes that they
mediate in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we can find different classes of
plants that are having different impacts
[SPEAKER_04]: on the soil environment, we can
incorporate those into rotations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably already are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then influence the soil bacterial
community and the soil pools as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, genotype effects are evident in
the data, including within the germplasm
[SPEAKER_04]: from a commercial breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the mechanisms for this are still a
little unclear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And looking at the second experiment that
I showed with you, the synchrony between
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere effects and nitrogen uptake in
the field, I think is sort of a foundation
[SPEAKER_04]: for understanding, you know, where we
might look for plant influences on these
[SPEAKER_04]: processes and also the benefits of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, the breeding history at
least modern hybrid breeding has
[SPEAKER_04]: maintained or enhanced nitrogen uptake
from soil pools, while leaving rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: assembly at least the amount that we can
detect relatively unchanged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with that, there's many,
many people to acknowledge for this work.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Torch Sustainability Foundation
actually gave us our seed grant to get our
[SPEAKER_04]: first project started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the USDA Hatch and the National
Institute of Food and Agriculture program
[SPEAKER_04]: provided further funding to develop the
work further.
[SPEAKER_04]: My committee, Lori Drinkwater,
Margaret Smith, Daniel Buckley have been
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastic in supporting me in this
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've learned an extreme amount from
them, as well as the entire Drinkwater and
[SPEAKER_04]: Buckley labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can't do this work without
your lab mates.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few that deserve particular
mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather Scott, our research assistant in
the Drinkwater lab, was a phenomenal help
[SPEAKER_04]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: She single-handedly must have helped me
salvage several over-ambitious field
[SPEAKER_04]: projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa Weiss, a former postdoc in the
Drinkwater lab, really trained me on the
[SPEAKER_04]: biogeochemistry and the soil science
aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick Youngblood was a postdoc working with
Dan Buckley.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now with Ruth Lay at the Max Planck
Institute, providing the training for the
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial community analysis in the
biogeochemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without them, I could not have done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the horticulture section for
the support, for the environment that you
[SPEAKER_04]: provided for the years that I was here,
as well as the Cornell undergraduate
[SPEAKER_04]: biology program for their funding as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many, many other people that
deserve recognition, but I can't list them
[SPEAKER_04]: all here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'd like to say thank you
for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to take your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Geneva have any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the graph of the nitrogen application
in the yield that you showed many times,
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the points were down right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black ones are really on the two
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the open surface?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so this is an analysis from this
paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe there were some funny things
that happened this year, like droughts and
[SPEAKER_04]: other things that artificially knocked
down yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those are their indication that
it's not on the regression line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian, early in your talk, you mentioned a
correlation between rhizosphere population
[SPEAKER_03]: and mammalian gut.
And I didn't understand that correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets back to this hypothesis of does
the organism evolutionary history
[SPEAKER_04]: influence the microbiome that that
organism is selected for?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had seen that in the POACI.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Ruth Lay did a study that was
looking at the evolution of mammals and
[SPEAKER_04]: the phylogenetic relatedness of mammals
and the microbial community composition in
[SPEAKER_04]: their gut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they found was that, yes,
there was this relationship with
[SPEAKER_04]: evolutionary history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And particularly once you controlled for
food source or the mammal's diet,
[SPEAKER_04]: then this relationship was much stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sort of informing our current
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to see buckwheat in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that is a plant that seems designed
to support a huge microbial community,
[SPEAKER_03]: briefly, but perfectly designed for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I couldn't tell without the weightings
whether that, in fact, was characteristic
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buckwheat is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so early on, one of the first slides I
showed showed sort of a picture of a
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is actually buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It forms these great rhizosheaths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there must be some polymers that it's
releasing that are really just helping
[SPEAKER_04]: glue the soil together and foster a
microbial community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't show the data, but its enzyme
activity is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't fall out on that axis of
the longer lived, higher nitrogen use
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the other end.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not to say that there's not
interesting stuff happening on that end.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good one to study.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're at the BTI, where it's
mostly focused on mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I often see in conclusions
ecologists will say mechanisms unclear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're at BTI, and your focus is now
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you clarify the mechanisms of
why you would see different species or
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes influencing the bacteria?
[SPEAKER_04]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to build on some of the work that I
presented here, and particularly the
[SPEAKER_04]: actinobacteria story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my hypothesis is that it has to do with
plant carbon flow, or rhizosphere carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some ways, that's testable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can measure root oxidation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can manipulate the environment the
plant's growing in to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can slow down growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some other alternative
hypotheses, I think, about why
[SPEAKER_04]: actinobacteria might be selected for.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some work showing that they
thrive in the rhizosphere under drought
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we could imagine that maybe the
variation that we're attributing to
[SPEAKER_04]: differences in rhizosphere carbon flow may
actually have to do with these plants'
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on soil moisture status in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that, again, is testable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can manipulate the water potential of
the rhizosphere and test whether or not
[SPEAKER_04]: certain subsets of the community respond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps a place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time for one more question.
Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, are there any implications for crop
rotation from this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of things, it's been de
rigueur for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But would you care to speculate on how
rotational cycles might be informed by
[SPEAKER_02]: your data, your findings?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one that I tried to allude to,
but maybe not clearly enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so choosing the diversity of plants
that we plant in our agricultural systems
[SPEAKER_04]: is really one of the primary management
tools that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rotations is a great one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we choose rotations for a number of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: We think of them often from a plant
pathogen perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can break up the pathogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this data suggests that the
impacts on the broader microbial community
[SPEAKER_04]: may also be important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wasn't testing pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these different groups of microbes,
if they're having different impacts on the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil environment, and I think there is
reason to believe that they are,
[SPEAKER_04]: from a soil conditioning perspective,
what you precede or the sequence in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rotation may have very important effects
on the soil nutrient pools and the group
[SPEAKER_04]: of microbes that's there to take advantage
of it in the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which would seem to imply that a chronic
monoculture maze is probably not
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial to the rice sphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if it's not broken up,
then we can probably make a strong
[SPEAKER_04]: inference that continuous maze cropping is
not the most beneficial things for soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, thank you so much,
Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
