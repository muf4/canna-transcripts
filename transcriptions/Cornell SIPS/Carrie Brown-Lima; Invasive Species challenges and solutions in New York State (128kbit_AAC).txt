[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank you all for inviting
me here today, and to you all for coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, you did tell me that I've
had an invasive species talk for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was actually told at some other
conferences that sometimes they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: invite invasive species people because
they only talk about doing little,
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming problems, and there aren't
really any good solutions to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of my talk today,
Invasive Species Challenges and Solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York State, I am going to outline a
lot of the problems, some of the species
[SPEAKER_00]: we have here, but I also want to talk a
little bit, actually a lot, about what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing here in New York State to
address those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually really ahead of the game
here, and I've worked out of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: for 11 years, and it was so refreshing to
come back and see a situation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and the right people in their
positions to actually accomplish something
[SPEAKER_00]: for conservation and for improving natural
resources management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get started on that,
and for those of you, I see Betsy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back there, and for those of you who know
a lot about invasive species just there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really sure of the level of
knowledge that you all have on invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and I wanted to make sure we were
all on the same page before I dove into
[SPEAKER_00]: more specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start by making sure that we
all are speaking the same language about
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species because there's a lot of
different terms that we see thrown around
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're talking about species that are
native, introduced, non-native,
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic, alien, weeds, nuisance,
pests, non-indigenous, and so what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is we're talking about
species that are introduced, they're new
[SPEAKER_00]: to the environment, and they're
problematic, and that's what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in New York State, we follow the
national definition for invasive species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a species that's non-native,
it's a ecosystem under consideration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and whose introduction causes,
or is likely to cause, economic or
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental harm, or harm to human
health, and to be considered invasive,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually has to have negative impacts
that significantly are greater than the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just really quick, when we're
thinking about native species,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking about species that have
developed over hundreds or thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years in a particular region, and so
usually a native has like a future of
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic qualifier, like native to New
York, native to North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on, and usually they only count
species as native if they were here before
[SPEAKER_00]: your human settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a non-native species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a species that comes from a
different place and has arrived through
[SPEAKER_00]: human activity, deliberately or
accidentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people work with a lot of
non-native species that are not invasive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I like to make sure that we make
this distinguish between invasive and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-native.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other part of the definition is
that it causes some sort of environmental,
[SPEAKER_00]: economic, or harm to human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are actually the things that
we're concerned about when we are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure many of you have heard of
giant hogweed, it was even on Yahoo News.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know Yahoo News actually had
important news on it, but this was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually pretty interesting, they were
talking about how someone was gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: and came into contact with hogweed,
which is, we find that in New York State,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ended up with burns after they were
exposed to sunlight and severe burns
[SPEAKER_00]: across their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also sometimes forget that we have
invasive mosquitoes that carry very
[SPEAKER_00]: serious diseases like Zika virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We forget that the black rat was not
necessarily native and carries diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other diseases that are not native
that are decimating our bat populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're even finding that some invasive
shrubs are related to, are associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: Lyme's disease and increased tick
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic impact of invasive species
are two-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have the actual loss
associated with the invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Spidermoon geosophila,
which many of you may be familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New York State, was projected by
Cornell to have 7 million dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lays its eggs in nice, very beautiful
berries that you're looking to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of days later,
when you're home and ready to eat them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a little container full of larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine the effect that has on
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have loss to fisheries in the
Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sea lamb prey greatly reduced our
sport fish populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they latch on and end up
killing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other impacts in our forests,
which are very significant when we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut loose trees that are valuable for
timbers, such as ash and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other part of the,
and also even in invasive species in
[SPEAKER_00]: lakes, we see property values going down
significantly when the lakes are all
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged up with species and no one can
vote or swim in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the second part of the
equation of the economic impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that impact of the plastic we're
spending to control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an estimate of 167 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that number was put out by Clinton
until 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we have a very hard time
quantifying those impacts, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: significant and they are difficult to
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is kind of my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in conservation biology for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of the impact that I
think about and I'm most intrigued by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the ecological impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a state with reduced biodiversity,
and they're actually considered the second
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest threat next to loss of habitat
impacting species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many invasive species are endangering
species that we care about here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Swalivore encroaching on the
heartstone fern just an hour north of
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have other instances of species
hybridizing, non-native species,
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species hybridizing with native,
and we're losing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing those populations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disrupts ecosystem functioning,
and also disrupts specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to point out this work of Doug
Talley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote the book Bringing Nature Home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be familiar with that because it's
related to your field, where he really
[SPEAKER_00]: points out these really specific
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these photographs are Dr. Talley's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a chance to see a
presentation by him, please go out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: way and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have these very specific
interactions between insects and their
[SPEAKER_00]: host plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, like the monarch butterfly,
they depend on one specific species to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we change that by introducing
non-native species, we actually lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did some really cool research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually telling me about it when
he was here a couple of years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he went out and he had his grad
students and interns collect all the
[SPEAKER_00]: species they could find on native species
and then all the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these aren't even invasive species
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just non-native in a landscaped
yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, he's looking at native
blackbird on an oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found 518 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get down to the great mural,
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I put this little, this is also a
photo by Dr. Talley.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, these are all non-native
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These species are important not just for
their existence, but they support a fluid,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as birds feeding their young and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he says here alien ornamentals
support 29 times less by a person than
[SPEAKER_00]: native ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to shift gears a little from
the impacts to invasive species here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the arts state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm having bases, which I'm
going to talk a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, their number changes because
we have more species, partially due to
[SPEAKER_00]: more reporting and partially due to more
species coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have 407 species that are
varying levels of invasiveness in their
[SPEAKER_00]: database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is monitored every year that I
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing notable about here in New
York state is we have more forest pests
[SPEAKER_00]: than any other state in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very significant because
forest pests are really the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only invasive species that can,
or the only impact that can virtually wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: out two species within a matter of
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one that I focus on quite a bit
because it's one that has such clear
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have many forest pests in New York
62, I believe, to this day, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamagulia delgid, emerald ash borer,
and oak will, southern pine beetle,
[SPEAKER_00]: chestnut light, which has already wiped
out our chestnuts, and the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for example, I just wanted to
highlight one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in from Asia, and it has been here
since 2002 in the US, spread to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we're about to lose all of our
ash trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're starting to see why invasive
species folk don't get invited places to
[SPEAKER_00]: get ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tens of thousands of ashes have been
lost, and it's spreading across the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I will go back to say there are
solutions being sought out for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily just a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may lose all our ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gene banks, where we have programs
that are collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for resistance in the ash to
try and see if we can find those
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that are resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a very advanced
biological control program that will
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully start kicking in and helping
some of these ash survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to be all negative about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is another species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I specifically point this out here
because I want you all to be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're out a lot, it's really
important that we have a lot of eyes out
[SPEAKER_00]: there looking for this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the spotted mantis fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was introduced into Pennsylvania back
in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in on slabs of granite that were
imported from Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it has become a pest like
we never imagined it would be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quarantines trying to keep it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many cases in South Korea,
and they've never even seen the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior that we're seeing here with the
population expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attacking grapes, apples,
hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily eat the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually just screens a honeydew on
them that makes them uncivil afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with pesticides, the population
is so large that they can't keep them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, we're actually having a
look out here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying very hard to contain it down
in Pennsylvania and not let it cross our
[SPEAKER_00]: borders because those crops are very
important to our economy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to bring it up because I know
many of you are out and about and would
[SPEAKER_00]: have an opportunity to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this red on its wings,
and it kind of plumps up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had brought that to you,
because it's pretty disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it eating the foliage?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's actually sucking the flow I
believe, and I'm not an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what proves the grapes are chewable,
it excretes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It excretes this honeydew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to wipe out the native
grapes that are- No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more genetics to look through where
you can't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had some plants, and the plants
have less productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just down in Pennsylvania two weeks
ago for a workshop, and they are up in
[SPEAKER_00]: arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do report it to the D.E.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: if you find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a lot of aquatic invasive
species here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have heard about how you can
lay a drilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more than snakehead, which we're
trying very desperately not to let spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new invasive species, this clumpy green
thing in here, is stony starwort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, starry stonywort, I always forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a tongue twister.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, it's an algae that forms
layer upon layer upon layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no control method known,
and it's been a huge problem in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest for a few years, and recently it's
started becoming problematic here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put up here zebra mussels as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just an example of the cost of
hydrallia here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with the aquatic invasive
species coordinator for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said they've spent over $15 million
just for treatments since 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only found in a couple of
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can imagine the cost involved
in trying to prevent lakes being choked
[SPEAKER_00]: out the way they are in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, of course, have our terrestrial
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big challenges we've been
dealing with is swallower, pale applied
[SPEAKER_00]: swallower, which is very difficult to
control and spreading rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phragmites and many of the invasive
shrubs that you may be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to point out earthworms
as a terrestrial species that I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be thinking about a little more
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm happy that this has actually
been trying to, our database here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York has been trying to find more
information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think a lot of times that,
first of all, earthworms are native,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in this area, we don't have any
native earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little farther south, we do have a
couple of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our earthworms here are not native.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they may be good for aerating
soil, so the farmers say, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad for forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some recent research here at Cornell
has been going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other places, they've shown that it
reduces leaf litter, it leaves the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the forest dry and mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've actually seen a decline in
plant species diversity and an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the decrease in the soil moisture has
also resulted in decrease in arthropods,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has impacted salamanders,
and groundless ebbers, and so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is this concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually, you can report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find invasive earthworms,
you can report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really looking to better
understand their distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you who are digging a lot,
you probably see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a big deal for people who
are selling plants that are hiding in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or selling mulch, because that's how one
of the way things is spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they're all native.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's European earthworms here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy worm is the one that's going to
be wriggling and jumping all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of burrows you out,
because it's all wiggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are species of European
earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that they're actually really
looking for reporting in the database is
[SPEAKER_00]: the Asian junkie worm, or crazy snake
worm, or whatever else they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's pretty obvious when you
find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have these invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have other things that are
happening and that are impacting our
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems that are actually also helping
invasive species spread further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get to the good part eventually
with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate change is something that
everybody's hearing about, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere you go, on the news,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And climate change is really interesting,
because we're seeing and we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and really starting to gather
data on how it's impacting invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they have a whole hour talk on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just going to quickly go
through a few of the ways the rising
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures allowing invasives to attack
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's an earlier spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave out earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, I'm sure,
when you're out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those first green leaves in the
understory, those are usually invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they gain the advantage,
where the native species don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also expanding their range.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving north.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can live farther north now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can survive the winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've had storms that are creating
disturbances, which invasive species love,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they adapt to disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this interesting little picture,
and I hate to even resort to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I like this study so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at increased CO2 levels in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they showed was that,
this is of this alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what species it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have higher CO2, invasive
species can respond to that and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than native species, even in the
same higher CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that, they're more resistant to
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will challenge the way we manage a lot
of these weeds, in both agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: native natural settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're already seeing the range of the
Helaculea delgit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody ever thought it could live in the
Adirondacks, because it's too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: surviving the winters, and it's moving
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at it, it's just kind of
like a March north.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been seeing it move up, and it's
able to survive winters, and it's adapting
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cold spellings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, this is happening with
a number of other species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And predictions have shown, and this is
from Jennifer Allen from UNH, and Bethany
[SPEAKER_00]: Bradley from UMass, and predictions are
showing that New Orleans will kind of be a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot spot in the future for new invasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to keep an eye out and
be proactive about not introducing these
[SPEAKER_00]: species that we thought were from us into
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another cool study that was
done by S.
[SPEAKER_00]: T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank down in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was even looking at, and this is
relevant for you all in your field as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at gloomy scale insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not introduced species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was looking at using cities that
are slightly warmer and drier,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same kinds of conditions that we
expect in some regions due to climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change, compared to slightly cooler
outside the city and slightly moister.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was finding that the scale had an
explosion in their population,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in a couple of degree warmer
environment and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started negatively impacting
the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be pests that aren't,
and we call these sleeper species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're species that are there,
hanging out, and under new climate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, they're allowed to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another change that we're seeing in our
environment and impact that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: on our lives, both in our gardens and in
our cities, in our forests, are the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in white tail deer populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been a steady rise for
decades now due to decreased hunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: due to better conditions for them to
survive due to warmer winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really thinking about,
we see what they do in our gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not always thinking about what
they're doing when they're out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taken at night, and these are
native oak seedlings that were planted as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love how he looks at the camera,
because he got caught on film,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you can see how quickly one deer in
a couple of seconds can really take down
[SPEAKER_00]: native vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of picky eaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, probably from your
gardens, they don't really like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the invasive species or introduced
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can go into much more detail on
this, too, but what I just wanted to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you is that they're also helping invasive
species spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some researchers here at
Cornell, Andrea Davos, and Ben Ambrozzi,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as many others, have done fencing
experiments where they fence out the deer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they see and compare what happens
inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that actually this
really invasive species that we consider
[SPEAKER_00]: highly problematic here in New York,
the biomass is reduced significantly when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's inside the fence, when the deer are
left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the deer aren't eaten by the
weight of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, if you went deeper into this
study, it would show that we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: trillium too better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more native species inside the
fence and outside the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a picture, and I didn't
include it in here, where you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: still grass growing right up to the fence
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it stops, and you see mixed
vegetation on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got not only the species
here, but we have all these facilitating
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that are helping them spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna shift gears a little bit,
and as we're speaking about solutions for
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species, we need to really think
about how are they getting here to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the first place to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them have been introduced
purposefully intentionally over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: because we thought they'd be good for
securing erosion along the stream side,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as with tamarisk, as you can see in
that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done much more than secure the sit on
the stream side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also introduced them, the
Shakespeare enthusiasts introduced many
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive birds we have here today from
here because they were mentioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: Shakespeare's books, like the starling,
European starling, house sparrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a flock of starlings that you
probably have seen quite frequently in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, at some point, we actually used
to do just experiments where we'd throw
[SPEAKER_00]: out new species into the field to see if
they'd control another species without
[SPEAKER_00]: screaming or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as the cane toad that was introduced
into Australia and now it's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: taken over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a chance to see that video,
it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just research, moving on cane toads,
it's a really funny move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really shocking what they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of what we're seeing now are not
intentional interactions, but we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a lot of interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see species coming in through gas water
ships, in packing materials, on plans,
[SPEAKER_00]: in produce transport, and those that are
coming through the pet trade and around
[SPEAKER_00]: trade have escaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the main unintentional
pathways that we're still seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: species come in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since it's trade that's driving a
lot of these introductions, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the situation of trade today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually seen a horrible
increase in shipping during the past 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years and a threefold increase in air
travels in the past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a phenomenal amount of
travel and transport of goods allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: species to come in, which really makes our
work challenging to keep them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had people say, oh, won't they
run out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't they likely to, you know,
the number that we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced, it's going to go down so we
don't need to be quite as vigilant or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Sandy Leopold from the Forest
Service did a really interesting study
[SPEAKER_00]: where he showed that even though we're
depleting, and this is just other boring
[SPEAKER_00]: insects or hard fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said one of those, he took all those,
but this actually translates across taxa
[SPEAKER_00]: that, okay, you know, we've just created
the coolest species that could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: be introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the acceleration of imports and the
likelihood that they could make it here
[SPEAKER_00]: shows that we won't be getting a break
anytime soon from having new
[SPEAKER_00]: introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an area that we're going to
have to be super attentive to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, actually, we are pretty
vulnerable here to new introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of goods coming in,
the second highest volume of goods in wood
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23% of the plants that enter the country
come through New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York is actually a pretty similar
bio, pretty similar conditions to the
[SPEAKER_00]: source of a lot of our shipped goods,
which is Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're a temperate zone and they can
get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting here is just a piece of the
battle, is being able to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have good conditions and matching
conditions from their home range,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can actually allow them to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also are coming in from other
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to say it's just coming in
through shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have a good world coming
from the Midwest, CAB, and many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 2003, I'm getting to the
solutions part, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2003, we got Pepper Tacky put
together a new basis species task force.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew it was a big problem here in New
York and wanted to do something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, asked some of the people on
task force from right here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And years later, they published 12
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go through each of these
recommendations, but what I can say about
[SPEAKER_00]: these recommendations, and I'll talk a
little bit about some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they've all actually been
implemented, which you don't always see a
[SPEAKER_00]: report come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people take action and actually
do the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was part of the battle here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them needed the permanent
leadership structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually see an advisory committee
member here, which is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a basis species council,
which takes a lot of the decisions about
[SPEAKER_00]: the path we're going to take here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made up of the nine agency agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's co-chaired by the DC and the
Department of Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks at the basis species issues,
prioritizes funding, recommends
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, and they're advised by the
basis species advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give information to the council
and help make recommendations on
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's made up of 25 members,
including people from industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been really important over
time to make sure industry is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have industry representatives that
are on the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen a lot more industry
participation, and it really helps balance
[SPEAKER_00]: our decisions about the basis species when
we have that kind of input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we also have our boots on the
ground here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The partnerships for regional basis
species management called the PRISMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cover the whole state, each PRISM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be they just had a full-time
coordinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they actually have staff and interns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're out there trying to get people
to work together and prioritize the basis
[SPEAKER_00]: species management and do it, and also
educate and outreach to the public about
[SPEAKER_00]: different basis species issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really cool about this is
actually we're one of the only states in
[SPEAKER_00]: the region actually in much of the US that
has this comprehensive coverage where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have people out on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes my job really easy because I
have all these contact points that then
[SPEAKER_00]: have their groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can actually put an invasive
species responses into action within this
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Florida, for example, they actually
have thousands of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought we had a lot of invasive
species in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to Florida for a workshop
in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I felt stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, oh, we have 400 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's excuses in our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have this comprehensive system
with unpaid individuals that it's like 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: of their job working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you see that some of the other
states have PRISMs that cover it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually, New York has been very
proactive in making sure that this program
[SPEAKER_00]: is funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this program is also a
comprehensive database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really important for people
who are out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understand plant identification and
insect identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just want to learn about it to
be able to report what you're seeing or do
[SPEAKER_00]: surveys and identify the distribution of
some of these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really depend on citizen scientists to
provide some of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can't make people to be
everywhere all the time trying to report
[SPEAKER_00]: this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's trainings all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do them online if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just type in IMAP in Basis New York and
you can get information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then part of this system as well,
a recommendation was the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species Research Institute, which is the
institute that I direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose of the institute is to
communicate and coordinate invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species research to help prevent and
manage the impact of invasive species in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the information is out there,
I'm coordinating webinars and conferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CCA in-service in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has an invasive species track that I
coordinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also making sure that researchers are
communicating their information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I talk to the people out on
the ground that are dealing with invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species to find out what is it that they
need to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their hardest species they're
dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or where are the information gaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I can coordinate and promote
researchers to actually do that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm more of the research institute that
doesn't have a staff of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: research scientists, but depends on its
network and collaborations to get things
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all funded through the New
York State Environmental Protection Fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a continuous funding line,
which it has been essential in moving
[SPEAKER_00]: these efforts forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to recognize some faces in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are these prisons doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're doing prevention, detection,
and management of invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ranging from promoting regulations and
advising on prohibited and regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: species to trying to detect species early
and getting out there or to washing boats
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming up with new solutions and
training volunteers and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wouldn't be an invasive species
presentation if we didn't bring up the
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have seen this invasive
curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the curve is actually how it
helps us frame our thinking for invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at the bottom, you can see you're
catching the prevention, catching the
[SPEAKER_00]: species before it gets there,
understanding those pathways that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the control costs for that,
as you can see, are the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you go up the curve, the area
infested by the invasive species
[SPEAKER_00]: increases, it's over time, and the control
costs increase, and also the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: managing or eradicating the species
decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we like to do is prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get farther up, eradication becomes
more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early detection, we want to try to get
it when it's in this yellow area,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in this yellow part of the curve,
so we can actually have a chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once it's widespread,
like many other species you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbary or Amalachor or so on and so
forth, we really just are managing our
[SPEAKER_00]: assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're protecting this tree or this pond,
but we're not ever going to get rid of it
[SPEAKER_00]: unless we come up with a longer term
solution, which I'll talk about afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so as I mentioned, we have a few,
we're targeting the pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd like to go into a little bit of
detail about a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have a boat washing
program here in New York State that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is prevent the
spread of invasive species from one lake
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of a way that
we've been working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lakes in the Outback that have no
invasive species at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep the invasive species
out of those lakes, and we want to contain
[SPEAKER_00]: them just where they're at so that we can
keep them in one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, as of a couple years ago,
how many of you are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated and prohibited species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a number of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to shift just really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not, you're going to see it's not
my presentation because I usually don't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the ins and outs of the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted just to share a little bit of
additional information for those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: who aren't familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of 2015, so this presentation was
passed on to me by Dave Adams.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the coordinator for the invasive
species section at the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Conservation here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have two types of species on
this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have prohibited species, which is
completely illegal to possess,
[SPEAKER_00]: import, purchase, transfer, or introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have regulated invasive
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really can't introduce it into the
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into all the
definitions here, but you can keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell it and buy it and transfer it
as long as it's kind of controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there should be labels on these
regulated species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using them for landscaping,
you can certainly provide yet more
[SPEAKER_00]: information from the DC or the Department
of African Markets on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you actually do need to put a label on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a written notice must be provided to
clients that these species are regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: and that they are invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use these, the private
species, you can apply for a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always, you have to have a good
reason for it, apparently, for research or
[SPEAKER_00]: education or other approved activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some exceptions, apparently,
that I don't know what these would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you could try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also working on cultivars,
where they are trying to approve certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars for some of the most used
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landscaping plants, ones that aren't able
to reproduce and that are sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some options that are
being developed by researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of them have already been
introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was on the committee that was
looking at some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know from our area, some other
grasses, they have approved some cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this, and actually, I'm going to
draw these off for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are booklets on the plants and the
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get them on the DC website in
the PDF version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also presentations and for
them to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are resources for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Dave's personal contact
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether he'd direct you to
agri-markets or not, but you can certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to the DC or agri-markets for
more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say, there are a couple of
things about this before I finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that they are regulating, preventing
species from being spread within the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York or potentially coming into New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't keep species out of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of our current activities for
prevention here in New York State are
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing the next emerald ash borer from
coming in from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some federal, and maybe you
probably know this with your words in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant world, that there are restrictions
on which plants can come in if they think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain treatments that I
mentioned with pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pallets are a big source of forest pests
and as well as woody plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in the same genera as northern
African plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the big risks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some treatments in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a question about whether
they're effective enough as we still
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to get new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would put into the federal part
today is that it's an important aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: that New York should expand its focus too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next part of the curve is this
yellow part that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like finding a needle in
a haystack a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to find a species before
its population has grown enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to catch it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really hard to find these small
plants or this first insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here in New York, we are employing
a lot of ways of finding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been training volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has a really cool drone program
where they're actually looking at forest
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using Landsat data to data
collected from satellites to detect early
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations in some of these forest
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have David Lodger at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a top researcher working with
environmental DNA where you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: water sample and detect whether an
invasive species is in that water body or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether endangered species is in that
water body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also even been exploring working
with conservation dogs who are excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: at finding things early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you're here, then I'm
going to print out part of the extension
[SPEAKER_00]: page service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a whole session on how
you can employ conservation dogs for
[SPEAKER_00]: detection of invasive species or for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to make this something that
interests you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, there's long-term
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time did I start?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last part is to see what we're
looking at as far as solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do when there's actually a huge
population and it's wise for the grass to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider our control actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can remove them physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can introduce a natural predator
that only feeds on that species in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually what we consider a
long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll touch a little bit more on some
of the projects we have coming in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these species that come in that are
introduced to biocontrols are very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully screened and have been tested to
make sure they don't eat anything or do
[SPEAKER_00]: some anything but the invasive that it's
targeted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to go back a little bit
and just talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives that the New York invasive
species research has going on and the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things we're doing to help
promote better and more informed data in
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species prevention and control
and early detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've been really focusing on a
lot is we do all these control methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times we don't know whether
we're actually successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a problem for invasive
species management because we get funding
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funding doesn't allow for
post-treatment monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an example of this, and I don't know
if you found the Great Lakes Restoration
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, but they actually spent 25,
actually now it's 30 million for
[SPEAKER_00]: phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phragmites is, I'm not sure if you're all
familiar with that, a wetland plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very problematic and widespread and hard
to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they spent almost 30 million over a
five-year period to control phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were no reports included in that
funding of whether it was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only reported the amount that they
sprayed, the number of people they
[SPEAKER_00]: employed, the area that they covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no funding in it for them to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our partners from Dan Rondack,
Chris Lundgren, he went out and they
[SPEAKER_00]: measured, not GLRI funding, but with their
own funding, they went out and they
[SPEAKER_00]: monitored all the sites where they were
controlling phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was if you had a patch
that was bigger than the front of this
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you had zero probability of ever
eradicating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he partnered with researchers here
at Cornell to do that statistical analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and came to that conclusion that really
helps guide some of the management for
[SPEAKER_00]: phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know we have a huge stretch of
phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to really get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's our goal, we should change
our objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I said, knowing whether we've
reached our goal, we can't know by the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount we've removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only can know whether the thing that
we're helping to protect, like our
[SPEAKER_00]: trillium, are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to start thinking about how we
measure success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been partnering with state parks and
promoting researchers to partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dr. Andrea Donalos from SUNY
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been helping state parks to measure
whether their swallow or control has been
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been doing all these
different methods, and now she's going out
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping them see whether they're
actually reaching their goals and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they should continue doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also mentioned a lot of species,
and it's really hard to make decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: about which of those species we should
manage and which of those we should not
[SPEAKER_00]: manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been working with some
computer scientists and with Dr. Angela
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hired a postdoc, Jen Pricebeck,
who's with that cute little fawn in her
[SPEAKER_00]: arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are developing, taking all of
this information and trying to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: model that can help guide our decision
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help us optimize our invasive species
management in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that the Research
Institute's been doing is we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with researchers, a lot of them
here at Cornell, to promote their getting
[SPEAKER_00]: funding and to promote them working on new
biological control agents for some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: most problematic species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may have heard of our Whitmore's
Biocontrol Pimodobolia Deligent Lab here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a really growing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This funded through the Department of
Environmental Conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also recently released for the
first time, you guys have seen that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: news, we released for the first time an
insect from the Ukraine that was approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for swallower biocontrol here in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also developing biocontrols here in
the Blasee Lab to control water chestnut,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very problematic aquatic
species, and also primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once, and I won't get into details
on it, but once you get an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol, the rest of it, it starts
working for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it reduces the population enough so
your native species can come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can swim in your lake, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get the right match,
then it actually is a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another issue that we've been working
with, I mentioned how climate change is
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting invasive spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we don't really
know, we don't know how we can incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge into our management plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even in the executive order,
that was the amendment to the executive
[SPEAKER_00]: order on invasive species, we've managed
that we consider climate change and
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really knows how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed the Northeast Regional
Invasive Species and Climate Change
[SPEAKER_00]: Management Initiative, together with the
Northeast Climate Science Center and Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bethany Bradley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been really bringing together
researchers and managers and taking a lead
[SPEAKER_00]: in helping out people to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also been working with researchers
to help share information on the new
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies for early detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we coordinated a workshop with Dr.
David Lodge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also coordinated on
environmental DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be coordinating one on remote
detecting invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also work to solicit and
synthesize expert opinions and make
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations to the council or to the
DST and other management managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, kind of my favorite part of
it all is this idea that innovation is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the director of the National Species
Council is Dr. Jamie Reed, who's pictured
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she really has promoted, let's think
across disciplines, let's think outside
[SPEAKER_00]: the box, and let's look for new solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an innovation summit about a year
and a half ago, trying to bring together
[SPEAKER_00]: these new ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really feel like here in Cornell and
in our universities, it's a place where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that innovation can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting to think about new
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's what, you know,
among the two of them on the Invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: Species Council, I really see that as a
little glimmer of hope in helping us
[SPEAKER_00]: really advance this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for you on your own time,
if you're looking for things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to do, to reduce invasive
species spread, if you're in your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: yard in New York, you can join your local
prism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always things to do, volunteer
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn to identify some of your
bases and enter them into the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you clean, dry, and dry your
boat, brush your shoes off so you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading these invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a duck town, you would be happy to
know that you plant native species in your
[SPEAKER_00]: yard or sell them in your garden store or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, and hopefully you'll
invite Invasive Species people back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one or two questions, if we have it,
while we're getting set up for our next
[SPEAKER_01]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't sound like you had very many
success stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were really hopeful and helpful.
You know, like, it feels like you're only
a layman's circle of blue sky.
Like, it sounds like how, you know,
a lot of, let's say, a lot of the trouble
was covered in our study.
So that's, like, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I actually, so I think,
I mean, the survey, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like, what are the things
that you would like to see research doing
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you do a better job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And biocontrol is not on top every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my, like, top projects,
were designed to help in biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: because when they're successful in purple
loosestrake, I did my master's research on
[SPEAKER_00]: purple loosestrake back in 2002,
and then I did that for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back, and I did it on
purple loosestrake, because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, it was a huge problem,
and we wanted to understand why it became
wild.
When I came back, nobody even talks about
purple loosestrake anymore.
That's how I like to do biocontrol.
So if you look at just how I'm doing
there, gamekeepers do not like that.
I apologize, I know that it's a sensitive
topic because it's still successful,
but they're actually losing some of their
pieces there.
But there are some pieces that are
important.
I know, maybe I didn't focus on that
conversation, but.
When you said it was being released for
the Swallow Award?
It's had Anna Aguilera, it's a mom,
that was found in Ukraine, and it might be
all over your assessment, but in the last
10 years, I've done research and process
of testing and approval for it,
it can be released.
So it was pretty exciting when I finally
was able to release it.
Now we're looking at the challenges of
mastering it and getting it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding, it actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where has it been released?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been released in a couple of state
parks, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big problem up in the north of the
state, off of the Panteras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's in the experimental stage,
because we don't really know what's going
to happen.
I mean, we know it's not going to be
anything else.
We don't know whether it's actually going
to survive in the New York climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've ultimately reduced the population of
Swallow Award, which is what we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're testing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to get it to the
country and actually release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we'll be striking hard and monitor
that same process and how it's being
pulled.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is bio control, and it's being
monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I've heard from the
researchers, they are having success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that bio control is going to
listen to in a lot of patients is it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time to actually establish the
population in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have that population to figure
out where it's going to introduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: other population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I've heard, I believe we
need further information if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fight hard and have a
connection with people who are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brian's project is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a good job out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where did they find them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They found them from the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have recovered the parasitoid from
Marvie in the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were released last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they survived the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're optimistic to establish the
population here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check back and let's say maybe 10 years.
Yeah.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank Mary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
