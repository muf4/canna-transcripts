[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I really did at Cornell was be
involved in the lettuce project,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a picture of one of the setups
that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was it was funded by the
NISAC, the local power company,
[SPEAKER_00]: NYSERDA, and at the time E-Circo,
Energy Research and Development
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporation, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were interested in selling more
power, more electricity, and we of course
[SPEAKER_00]: felt that if you wanted to grow a crop in
a relatively dark environment in upstate
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, you can only do that
successfully if you add lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we picked lettuce, and I don't remember
anymore exactly why we picked lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought at the time I think that it was
a great idea because it was a so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: simple crop to grow that turned out not to
be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked lettuce, and the objective of
the work was to try to grow it as fast as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, so have minimal time in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also have it finished in the same
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So independent of the weather conditions,
we wanted to have the lettuce finished at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of days it took from seeding
to harvesting was always supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep that in mind when you
think about our system and the approach
[SPEAKER_00]: that we took.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reasons of course is that greenhouse
space is very expensive, and so you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the crop in and out quickly,
and we couldn't wait, particularly when
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about changing lighting
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't afford ourselves to wait and
grow a crop over more days when the light
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions were not favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supplemental lighting was used,
and you see here the setup that we used
[SPEAKER_00]: using high pressure sodium lamps in a
specifically designed array to get high
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity and the highest intensity
possible given the limited resource in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of electricity that we wanted to use
for growing this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the results of that work was
here you see a graph that shows you the
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated light conditions since seeding
on the horizontal axis and the vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: axis you see the shoot dry mass or shoot
dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a very nice linear line,
not surprising when you think about a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: like lettuce that is a vegetative crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not really all that much
significant about this graph except for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that you're looking at 35 data
points, and each of those data points was
[SPEAKER_00]: a single treatment, and each treatment
started with about 800 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of work that went into
giving you this graph, this very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: linear relationship, was quite
significant, and many people were involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in this effort, and it took many,
many hours of work to get all these data
[SPEAKER_00]: points for this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we looked at was leaf area
versus the horizontal axis shoot fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: mass, and on the other on the right hand
side on the vertical axis we looked at dry
[SPEAKER_00]: mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got nice correlations between leaf
area and shoot fresh mass as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry mass and the fresh mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again not particularly surprising,
except I want to mention that if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the blue line you see a very nice
linear relationship between dry mass and
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh mass, and this resulted very quickly
in significant discussions with
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly with Professor Langhans,
because the staff obviously was more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in taking the fresh mass and
not do the tedious dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, dry mass measurements,
but he stood his grounds and we lost out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we did continue weighing plants
after they went through the drying cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had to do a lot of extra work
because of that, but to his credit that
[SPEAKER_00]: also meant that we had better results in
the end and more publishable results when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was going nice and smoothly
until we had hit a significant problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the problem was called tipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tipper is a physiological disorder,
and again I'm an engineer so you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask the plant physiologist for more
specific details, but my understanding is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is caused by a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is growing very rapidly and
calcium is not taken up quickly enough by
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots and not taken to the young
rapidly expanding leaf tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a result we see dieback of that
leaf tissue and you get a lettuce plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks much like this, and of course
although you get the dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation you can't sell the plant
because nobody in their right mind would
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Wegmans and buy this head of
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were stuck, we were trying to push
the plants as fast as we could to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out of the greenhouse as quickly
as possible, but we didn't reach,
[SPEAKER_00]: we couldn't grow and pass a certain point
because we started seeing this tipper
[SPEAKER_00]: issue from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had many discussions about what we
could do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at papers and we found a paper
from colleagues in Japan that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: blew air on lettuce plants to try to
increase plant transpiration and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the uptake and transport of
calcium from the roots to the young
[SPEAKER_00]: growing tips, and they seemed to have some
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we talked about how we could do
this envisioning a large greenhouse setup
[SPEAKER_00]: with little tubes that were blowing air on
individual heads of lettuce and we quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that this was not going to work
in a practical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned here we did a covert
experiment, and covert I have to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: was because Professor Langhans was out of
town at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had discussed this idea,
but I think he wasn't very much in favor
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, and so we took the opportunity,
I think he was either at a conference or
[SPEAKER_00]: he was going for his winter break in
Florida, and so we took that opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to put something together very simply,
an inflated plastic tube with little holes
[SPEAKER_00]: along the side positioned directly
overhead, two rows of lettuce plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we grew the plants and looked at the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much to our surprise, the idea worked
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the plants that received
additional air supply with this system did
[SPEAKER_00]: not get any tip burn where neighboring
plants did have significant amount of tip
[SPEAKER_00]: burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after we saw the result ourselves,
we could report back to Professor Langhans
[SPEAKER_00]: when he came back from his trip or from
his vacation that indeed we discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was a great idea and we should
investigate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he then quickly told us then to use
turbulence fans, overhead fans that could
[SPEAKER_00]: blow large amounts of air vertically down
on the lettuce crop to help increase plant
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration and overcome this tip burn
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what we started doing,
and this is how we overcome the tip burn
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, but to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that certain extent is, I'm trying to
show you here in this graph, where on the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal axis you look at dry mass
accumulation, on the vertical axis you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carefully tracked water use of plants
in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could come up with these lines,
and these are regression lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they are not the actual data,
but the result of the data that we
[SPEAKER_00]: collected to try to polish up the graph a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see here there's different
light treatments that have different rates
[SPEAKER_00]: of water use as the plants are growing
through the different stages to final
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we surmised from this graph that
you needed to have a minimum rate of water
[SPEAKER_00]: use or plant transpiration in order to
overcome this tip burn problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the top of the slide that
treatments up to 16 moles of light or so
[SPEAKER_00]: did not suffer from tip burn, where
treatments above that, 20 and 22 moles in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, did receive, or did experience
tip burn issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why, if you've been at all
familiar with the CEA program,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why we typically recommend that 16
to 17 moles of light is the limit using
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cornell system for growing lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this tip burn issue and because
of the fact that if you use additional
[SPEAKER_00]: measures to increase plant transpiration,
like these Turbulator fans, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome tip burn, but only to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still try to push the plants even
harder, you do get the dry mass
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, but you don't overcome the
tip burn issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also dabbled in CO2 experiments,
where we enriched the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say trading here with quotes,
and what I mean with that, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain with this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the vertical axis,
you see the shoot dry mass again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a dark line, a black line,
at 7 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the target weight that we were
trying to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That corresponds, if you go back to the
linear relationship between fresh mass and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry mass, that corresponds to a fresh mass
of approximately 150 grams, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: target mass we were trying to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 7 grams is our target size of plant
that we are trying to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look then at the different
light intensities indicated by different
[SPEAKER_00]: colored lines here, and you follow that 7
gram line from left to right, you see it
[SPEAKER_00]: intersects with the 17 moles first at
approximately ambient CO2 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is 20 years ago when CO2
concentration ambient was still around
[SPEAKER_00]: 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's approaching 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you go further to the right,
you see that horizontal line at 7 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: intersects with different lines of light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they correspond to different CO2
concentrations, if you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to tell you here is
that we found out that instead of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants at 17 moles at ambient CO2
concentrations, you could also grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at 12 moles, where you had to
increase the CO2 concentration to
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 1,300 or so micromoles per
moles or parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I mean by trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered that within limits,
you could decide, instead of adding more
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting, which is very
expensive, you could add or increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 concentration and get the same end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was an interesting discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you think about
commercial production, this can have some
[SPEAKER_00]: significant implications, because
obviously, it will be cheaper to add CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to adding supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all that work resulted in a set
of growth curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a second order exponential
polynomial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the equation in the box upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we only have one variable,
the daily light integral, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light we provided on a daily basis to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we provide that light every day to try
to keep the plants at their fixed growing
[SPEAKER_00]: rate to make sure we reach the target
harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, for different day
light integrals, what the growth curve
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like for the varieties that we were
using at the time, which was Austinata
[SPEAKER_00]: biblettus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at efficiency rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much energy do you need to provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you get in return in terms of
biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, I found a paper by
Monteith from 1977 that looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency rates in terms of the amount of
light that was intercepted versus the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at apples, barley, potatoes,
and sugar beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see these colored lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here indicating the data that he found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from this data, I can calculate
an average efficiency, taking into account
[SPEAKER_00]: that the heat of combustion for dry matter
is approximately 70 and 1 half kilojoules
[SPEAKER_00]: per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could look at the energy that you
provided through sunlight versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy that you gain from dry matter
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can calculate an efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the little blue line towards the
origin of the graph here is the line for
[SPEAKER_00]: our lettuce plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you think that it looks like the
lettuce is not doing so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to keep in mind that the
lettuce crops that we were growing only
[SPEAKER_00]: required a 24 day time period in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew it for 11 days in the growth
chamber and then 24 more days in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after 35 days or five weeks,
the plants were finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reached the 150 gram fresh weight
target harvest size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about this, the outdoor
crops can be grown only once in outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the greenhouse crops can be grown
actually 15 times in the same area in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiply both axes by 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the greenhouse crop was
doing significantly better than the field
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we did lots of
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were funny and some were informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them that I like particularly was
this continuous production, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: an NFT or nutrient film technique,
showing you the visual growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you the lines that we calculated
from the data that we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see actually in a visual
representation, an actual representation
[SPEAKER_00]: of what that growth curve looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every day we would plant a new row and
move the rows up until we finally ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a complete picture of what every
stage of the production looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same for floating systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we had visited a grower
in Canada that was using this floating
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quickly realized the benefits of
this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started working on floating
systems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see the same idea,
a visual representation of the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: curve of lettuce plants in that floating
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, and I'm sure
everybody here is familiar with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to, and I still think this is
very remarkable, out of the research that
[SPEAKER_00]: we did, and this is to the credit of
Professors Langhans and Albright,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to convince our sponsors
that it was a good idea to build a
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there are many research
projects that ultimately end up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly scaled demonstration
facility in which we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate that this lettuce production
system was going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that stage, the professor retired
and I left Cornell for Rutgers University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm switching now to some of the work
that I've been involved with at Rutgers
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you quickly can see that I'm switching
to a totally different crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutgers is more known for their work on
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came there, I had to switch my
thinking from a vegetative crop to a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering crop like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a particularly good
picture of a tomato plant, but it has one
[SPEAKER_00]: feature that I wanted you to look at,
which is the fact that the stem here is
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Rutgers approach was a different
approach from the traditional tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: production system in the sense that they
decided to grow single cluster or dual
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that meant that after the first food
cluster had started to develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would break off the growing tip and
let the plant put all its resources into
[SPEAKER_00]: the few fruit that it was developing
before the plant was then discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cropping cycle was much reduced in
terms of time, but also the spacing was
[SPEAKER_00]: much increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could pack these plants much closer
together in the system that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least theoretically, it appeared
that a system like this would be as
[SPEAKER_00]: productive as the more traditional lean
and lower system that you can see in most
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial greenhouse operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm switching to a tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the early work was funded by NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a bit of a contentious point
with the Cornell group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, Rutgers had an end score
project, a NASA funded project,
[SPEAKER_00]: where Cornell also was in the running and
trying to get the funding, but it went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutgers at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by leaving here, I lucked out and
ended up being part of the winning effort
[SPEAKER_00]: at Rutgers, although when I was here at
Cornell, I was at the losing end because
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't get the funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, from a NASA point of view,
and you have to think now about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: crops for space applications, where if you
do long duration space missions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be able to provide your crew
with nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not likely that you can
bring, it is economical to bring all your
[SPEAKER_00]: food with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to produce as you are
traveling, for example, to Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes important to know more about
these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so NASA was interested in funding some
research and looking at these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we discovered when we looked
at this and when we started working in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area, that if you look at published
work, in most cases, people have looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato production extensively,
but the conditions under which the
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes were grown were always kept
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you had certain set points
that you typically followed to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NASA, of course, was interested in
developing growth models that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: then use to try to simulate what the
production might be when you fly a system
[SPEAKER_00]: like that in space because they wanted to
start planning how much food they could
[SPEAKER_00]: count on for the crews that they were
planning to take with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we needed to have growth models for
those particular applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also knew that in the NASA system,
it might not be inconceivable that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were perturbations to those environmental
conditions because, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the power that was required to run the
lights was needed for another critical
[SPEAKER_00]: component in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the perturbations were really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that the perturbation studies
were not done very extensively,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not on tomato crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by talking to our specialists on
tomato crops, we knew that the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions during flowering
a fruit set were really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts around 55 days after
seeding for the particular system that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those conditions, if you do
perturbations in that time period,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for our case, it was about a two-week
time period, then that can have
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact on the quality and the
yield of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also looked at harvesting the
plants at the typical breaker stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which for a tomato plant means that the
color is just changing from green to
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly orange or pinkish, and harvesting
at a later date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we felt and we had indications
that if you wait longer, you get better
[SPEAKER_00]: quality aspects of your fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indeed, as you can see on the
bottom point here, we did find that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were significant improvements if you wait
longer before you start harvesting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, which is obviously not a major
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was nice that we could now have a
quantitative way of showing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work was done in growth chambers
mostly, so very familiar to the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers that you use at Cornell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a lot of mylar screening around
our plant stands to try to overcome the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue of side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, you would have side lighting
issues, and you would remove plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside rows from your experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we had limited area,
we wanted to include those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we used those screens to try to
overcome the side light issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we did it, we started plants
all in the same growth chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then depending on the treatment,
they were moved to different growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers to receive their treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there are issues associated
with when you start moving plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you disturb them, you stress them,
and we had to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not a particularly easy thing to
do, but we made the best of the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you insiders in
controlled environment work, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here that by we used fluorescent lamps and
incandescent lamps, and knowing from my
[SPEAKER_00]: time at Cornell that the use of
incandescent lamp is somewhat contentious,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I tried really hard to convince my
colleagues that we should not be using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I lost, obviously, the argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is perhaps an institutional
and historical artifact that we still use
[SPEAKER_00]: incandescent lamps for tomato production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching to a different project,
but still staying with the same crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like many other universities,
including Cornell, we were interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers were interested in it
particularly, and we got some seed money
[SPEAKER_00]: from our college to investigate high
tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We installed them in different places
across the state to look at different
[SPEAKER_00]: weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at different orientations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at tunnels with manual roll-up
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at tunnels with automatic
roll-up sites, which meant you had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a motorized system with a thermostat that
would operate the roll-up sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at different mulches,
different colored mulches for tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see in the bottom here,
we wrote an article looking at additional
[SPEAKER_00]: control measures such as an energy curtain
that you would pull over the crop at night
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to maintain the temperature a
little bit longer at optimum conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least at good growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a side note, I think we, of course,
Penn State is really heavy and really big
[SPEAKER_00]: in high tunnel research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been doing a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Cornell is doing a lot of work
in it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that across the region,
there should be more collaboration among
[SPEAKER_00]: the various institutions to try to not
duplicate efforts, because I think some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going on at these institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came to Rutgers, I inherited a
greenhouse shell so it wasn't looking as
[SPEAKER_00]: nice as it looks in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My predecessor was able to get funding for
the framework of a open roof greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which is a newer design that
allows for large amounts of air exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to keep the temperature inside
pretty much the same as outdoor conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summertime, which is typically not
feasible when you use mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have these open roof
greenhouses, you can get to those
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we quickly realized we needed to
improve this facility to get it up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: research grade facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gene Rees, my graduate student and
technician at the time, did the yeoman's
[SPEAKER_00]: work of getting this facility in great
shape for the experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see from the reference
here, he also looked into a heating
[SPEAKER_00]: system, a floor heating system,
and looked at the benefits of floor
[SPEAKER_00]: heating for crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see the inside of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ebb and flood floor system,
which is a very nice way of irrigating
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can grow them in pots and sit them
directly on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then embedded in that concrete layer,
we installed a heating system,
[SPEAKER_00]: a plastic pipe system through which we
pump hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that system was designed is
shown in this graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your concrete slab,
you have the heating pipes, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: also the supply and drainage system for
your irrigation system that ends up in an
[SPEAKER_00]: underground storage tank where you store
your nutrient solution to be ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next irrigation cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top of the floor was carefully
designed so it had a good drainage system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a W shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two rows of holes down the length
of the bay that collect the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the irrigation cycle, and then
drains it back into the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pumped the nutrient solution
through the same system back up onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor when the plants require water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, Gene did a lot of work on
developing a numerical model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, of course, engineering talk
to look at how the heat is distributed in
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see a section of a floor slab
as the box, the bar, and then some red
[SPEAKER_00]: dots indicating the location of the
heating pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the colors are indicating the
different temperatures at a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in this simulation run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get an idea of the type of work we
did using that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the results of those simulations
are shown in this graph, where on the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal axis you look at the supply
water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not likely that you will ever go
as high as 55 or 60 degrees because at
[SPEAKER_00]: that temperature you will likely cook the
crop that sits on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might go as high as about 50
degrees or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're looking at here is how much
heat is actually coming off the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: the top surface of the floor, and how much
heat is directed towards the bottom or the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlayer of ground underneath the floor
represented by the blue lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were interested in the
question, do you need to insulate
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath a concrete floor to try to
prevent heat from escaping to the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can't use for heating your
greenhouse environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition to that, we looked
at, and we could do this, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had a simulation model,
we looked at two different pipe designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One where we used 3 quarter inch pipes at
12 inch spacings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we used, which is more common these
days, a half inch diameter pipe at nine
[SPEAKER_00]: inch spacings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just design features that you
can incorporate in your floor heating
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there are some differences
between those two conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, I think what I'm
trying to show you here is that
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 10% of the heat that we were
able to supply in this floor heating
[SPEAKER_00]: system would end up in the soil
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining 90% of the heat would
actually end up in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based upon that fact, we can now
start looking at recommending to growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to install an insulating layer underneath
the floor to try to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when the ground underneath the
floor is relatively dry, dry soil is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: very good heat conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need the insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a wet soil, where
particularly if the soil moisture is in
[SPEAKER_00]: movement continuously, you can
significantly lose heat from underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, in those cases,
a layer of insulation might be very
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step we took is I showed
you the diagram of the simulated slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simulated a layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that slab, simulating plug production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the temperature
distribution in that layer of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that simulated layer of soil at different
heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the temperature scale on the
left hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bottom green lines represent
the highest location in that two inch
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of soil that is sitting directly on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue lines, the top lines
represent the location closest to the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here for the two different
designs where you have the 12 inch
[SPEAKER_00]: spacings with a little bit bigger pipe or
a little bit smaller pipe at the shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing of nine inches represented by the
Rs and the S, the return and the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: lines in the bottom of the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that the peaks coincide
with where the supply lines are installed
[SPEAKER_00]: and the valleys are represented with where
the return lines are installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all matches up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is more important, I think,
is to look at the fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we have a very uniform
heating system, with the simulation model,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could now start calculating exactly
what the temperature would be in our
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could, from that, could make some
assessment of whether these fluctuating
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures will have an impact on plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project I'm involved with is a
micro turbine project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a micro turbine is nothing more than a
jet engine in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stationary jet engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works on the same principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide it with gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it combusts the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, it drives a turbine that
generates electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use the electricity on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can export the electricity to the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can do a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using landfill gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landfill gas was initially just let go as
the landfill is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacteria break down the refuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methane gas is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That methane gas initially was just let go
to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we quickly realized that that
contributed significantly to greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, nationwide, we have legislation
that you can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to burn the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what's been done up until
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, that means they flared it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, then you waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You convert it to still a greenhouse gas,
CO2, which is less of a greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: than methane gas, less potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that point of view, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, you waste that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tapped into that resource and
designed this micro turbine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is if you use landfill gas,
it's not as clean as natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to clean it up in order
not to do damage to some of the critical
[SPEAKER_00]: components of the turbine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to remove sulfur gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see two large cylinders here that
contain a proprietary material that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably contains a lot of iron filings
that is able to strip out passively the
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur gas, the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through a compression cycle
and a refrigeration cycle to collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the gas, but also,
more importantly, the siloxane chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: a group of chemicals based on silicate
that can be very detrimental to engine
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the remainder of the gas is clean
enough to be combusted in the micro
[SPEAKER_00]: turbine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, it was a relatively
expensive undertaking, about $0.75 million
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it generates a fair amount of
electricity that we can use for the
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting system in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't need that, we can export
it to the grid and get a fairly decent
[SPEAKER_00]: price for the electricity that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is commissioned, as I show here,
in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some long-term data operating
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take any credit for this,
but because I started talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, I wanted to show you that we have
some progressive growers in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey as well as we have in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grower was using fuel oil as a fuel
source for his greenhouse operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about seven acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the increases in oil
prices, he is no longer able to
[SPEAKER_00]: economically use that fuel source to run
his operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he switched over to biomass energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wants to eventually get to a point
where he's using Miscanthus or switchgrass
[SPEAKER_00]: as the biomass feedstock for his
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has 200 acres on site that he's
planning to convert.
[SPEAKER_00]: to Miscanthus and switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, he is using wood pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here what wood pellet
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the truck delivering wood
pellets to large silos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the silos, it gets augured
into a boiler system that he uses to run
[SPEAKER_00]: his operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a lot of growers struggling with
the energy issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an example of how a progressive
grower was able to convert from fuel oil
[SPEAKER_00]: to biomass oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only challenge is, and he's still
fighting this a little bit, is that
[SPEAKER_00]: because of his combusting biomass,
he now has to deal with new air
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations from our state DEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air quality issue is important in New
Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our DEP is very strict about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the permitting issues associated with
the conversion from his oil system to this
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass system, although realistically,
there are not that many more contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: components that he is releasing into the
environment, just the permitting issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he has a biomass type combustion
system, have been very challenging for
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ, are those mainly particulates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also started to dabble a little bit in
LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little seed grant from the
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, in a very
simplistic way, we had very little money
[SPEAKER_00]: in that seed funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We purchased a bunch of off-the-shelf
screw-in type LED bulbs and started to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, as the tomato plants
are getting taller and getting close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lamps, you see certain areas that are
clearly red and clearly blue, the two
[SPEAKER_00]: colors that are typically used to try to
improve plant growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, this is not an ideal
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as an interesting side note,
and maybe this means something,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it doesn't, the two tomatoes that
you see here, one growing mostly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light and the other one growing
mostly on the red light, were not
[SPEAKER_00]: different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality aspects and the production
aspects were not different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were obviously on the same plants,
but they were getting, for a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time, a significantly different
color light provided to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before I move on, I should say
that I participated now in a much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: effort looking at LED systems for
greenhouse production with a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from different universities,
Kerry Mitchell at Purdue and others at
[SPEAKER_00]: Purdue, Eric Runkel in Michigan State,
the group of Gene Giacomelli and Cheri
[SPEAKER_00]: Kubota at Arizona, and myself at Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to look at a comprehensive
study, both from the plant aspect as from
[SPEAKER_00]: the engineering aspect, on what we need in
terms of LED lighting systems for the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also was involved for many years now
with an international committee that
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at guidelines for controlled
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in controlled environments,
you realize that when you read the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, people not always report all
the critical environmental parameters that
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to report in order for you to
understand, at least get a detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the experiments,
and also for you to be able to replicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, for many years with an
international group, looked at developing
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see the example for experiments
in growth rooms and growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have developed several of these
guidelines now for growth rooms and growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers, as well as for tissue culture
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on a guideline for
greenhouse production as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we are really trying to get after
is to have a table like this where
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers can look at the different
parameters that are important for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which you see on the left-hand
side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand what units they need to
use to measure those parameters correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: where to measure those conditions,
when to measure them, and what to report,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only in their reports to funding
agency, but perhaps more importantly in
[SPEAKER_00]: their reports to the scientific community
through papers and presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an ongoing effort, and although
it's a fairly thankless effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an important effort because
hopefully it'll bring the entire research
[SPEAKER_00]: community more in line with each other so
that we can better understand and use each
[SPEAKER_00]: other's results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then moving on to my sabbatical in the
Netherlands, and here you see a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of one of their greenhouse
facilities that is growing roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you want to see rose production
in the Netherlands, you should be quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think just like in the United
States, the costs are prohibitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's getting more and more difficult
for growers to continue this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wouldn't be surprised that in the
next 10 to 20 years, the entire rose
[SPEAKER_00]: production would disappear from the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with my old department,
the Ag Engineering Department,
[SPEAKER_00]: called now the Farm Technology Group,
which has become part of the Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who know a little bit
about the Netherlands, the way their
[SPEAKER_00]: system is set up is quite differently than
we have our system here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to take a few minutes to
explain a little bit how their system
[SPEAKER_00]: operates and how it's put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Plant Sciences Group consists of the
University, Wageningen University and
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Center, WUR, and then the Plant
Sciences Group in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a group called the Plant
Research International and the Applied
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Research Group, or PPO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these entities, the University,
the former extension, government research
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, are all combined in a
convoluted organization called the Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the locations, the main locations,
as well as their field trial stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give you some sense of the
value of the horticulture industry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly for Bill Miller,
I added bulbs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully my numbers are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you see the monetary value of the
exports both to the world and as a subset
[SPEAKER_00]: of that within the European Union,
the export, the dollar, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the euro amounts associated with these
exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for reference, I give you the gross
domestic products of the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the contribution that horticulture is
making to the country is very significant
[SPEAKER_00]: and hence perhaps the top position that
the Netherlands maintains up until today
[SPEAKER_00]: in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very nice new facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organization in Wageningen has also
completely changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are building an entirely new campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Plant Sciences Group, as you can
see here, has a very wonderful new
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with large greenhouse operations
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really put a lot of effort into
getting people up to speed and having the
[SPEAKER_00]: world-class facility there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you really wanted to know more
about the specifics, this is something I
[SPEAKER_00]: got out of a canned presentation by the
Plant Sciences Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four specific focus areas,
sustainable production and climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-based materials, health,
and systems biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read off under each of these
four areas, the specific areas that they
[SPEAKER_00]: target out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the main areas that they try to
focus their research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not doing everything anymore
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have specifically targeted areas
where they feel they can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike in the United States, in the
Netherlands, they have a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical service that collects many,
many data points, not only for the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse industry, but for many
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a wealth of data available
there about what the greenhouse industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show you several sets of
slides indicating what the trends are,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think there are some very
interesting trends going on and in very
[SPEAKER_00]: recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking here at three different
years in 2000, 2005, and 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last year I found data for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you can get this annual
updated data yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay about 150 euros or so to
get a nice book that contains many very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting facts about the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need this kind of data,
I can point you in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're looking at here is the
number of operations and the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: size of these operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the data carefully,
then you see that all sizes are declining
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly, except for the very largest size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing here is that the
number of greenhouse operations is
[SPEAKER_00]: declining overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see more of the remaining
greenhouses become larger and larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very recent development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that the average size was
around a hectare in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, in the last 10 years or so,
you see a significant change in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get fewer companies, but the
companies that are remaining are larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also separated out on the
bottom here comparing the vegetable versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the others, because the vegetables
obviously are of interest to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the same trend in the vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of vegetable operations is
significantly declining over the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but the size of the individual
operations is increasing and increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: quite substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the overall production area
in the Netherlands, that has remained the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, around 10,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you see some interesting
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first set of bars, you see that the
vegetable production significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there an increase in flowering pot
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the cut flowers is
significantly declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hence, my comment earlier about the
rose production, I think it is becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: too expensive to grow cut flowers in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is why I think you won't see
very many rose growers in the next 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the vegetable production,
you see a similar trend, although here we
[SPEAKER_00]: see an increase, particularly because of
tomato increase and pepper increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strawberry is mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, obviously, strawberry is not
considered a vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the Dutch industry, it's one of
the few fruits that are grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for convenience, they're typically
grouped in with vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see some of the vegetables are
increasing, others not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the cut flower and the
pot plant area, we see, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: roses declining, chrysanthemums declining,
and other crops declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, the cut flowers are declining,
but the pot and bedding plants are keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: steady or perhaps slightly increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's an interesting trend that
is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing Holland to one of the other EU
countries where lots of greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: production is going on is Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here that the production in Spain,
in terms of area, really dwarfs what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, I'm talking about
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about vegetable production
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons is that, of course,
if you look at a particular reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Almiria region in Spain, we see a very
significant increase in the last 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: or so in greenhouse production area in
that particular location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the main factor why Spain is so
much more of a bigger producer compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, of course, we see a shift
in focus when you look at the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Union in terms of where fruits and
vegetables are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auction prices are always interesting to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really want you to take home
from this slide is you're looking at two
[SPEAKER_00]: different years and several types of
tomatoes, round tomatoes, cherry tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the vine tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the challenge here, as we would have
in the United States, is that you see
[SPEAKER_00]: significant fluctuations from year to
year, and you see significant fluctuations
[SPEAKER_00]: from season to season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we always hope for with our
lettuce system is that because we could
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver consistently, there would be a
consistent price associated with that
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent delivery that is not happening
in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to happen anytime soon
in the Netherlands either, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers are forced to deal with this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it continues to be a very
challenging production system because some
[SPEAKER_00]: years you get a good price, and some years
you get a bad price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you deal with that from an
economic perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: From an economic point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of growers using combined
heat and power systems in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was historically because gas
prices were relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it made sense because they used
lots of supplemental lighting and used
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more of it in the last decade or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are expensive systems, but they were
economical at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in 2010, about 12% of the
national electricity consumption was
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really a significant contribution
from these individual systems installed at
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, we see that the gas prices
have increased because they are more tied
[SPEAKER_00]: to oil prices in Europe than they are
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see lots of growers getting in
trouble because this system is no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: as profitable as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have these expensive systems
installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have multi-year projections for how
they're going to pay them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, the situation
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas prices is more expensive than they
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity prices have not gone up as
high as they had hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping with the theme of lighting,
I've looked at lighting systems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the latest approach that they
are taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intercanopy lighting using LED systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only LED lighting, but still
maintaining overhead high-pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting to grow a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this is the ultimate approach,
I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least this is their latest
technology, latest state of the art,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they are trying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're claiming they're getting good
results, although I haven't seen many
[SPEAKER_00]: published publications about this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a food safety issue that I
wanted to mention that happened just
[SPEAKER_00]: before we came.
[SPEAKER_00]: An E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had significant implications on the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out to be a fenugreek seed that
was imported from Egypt that was grown on
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic farm in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took several weeks to discover the
cause of the infestation and as a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they needed to do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, many other crops were
implicated as a source for this food
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the entire production
came to a grinding halt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of fruits and vegetables had to be
discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, many growers got into
severe financial difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we see a large number of
greenhouse operations that had to shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down and close completely as a result of
this food scare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a precaution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had these food scares in the United
States as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not typically for greenhouse operations,
but more for field production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an example on how a completely
unrelated event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with greenhouse
production, nothing to do with crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: we typically grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a significant impact on the industry
to the point where we see growers going
[SPEAKER_00]: out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then moving on to some future directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put in this picture because I think
we should always be moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get into my suggestions,
I think we have to go back and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to show this slide looking
at population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should all be familiar to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Professor Langhans was born,
around the time we had 2 billion people
[SPEAKER_00]: living on this planet, by now we have 7
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the next almost 40 years or so,
by 2050, we will have 9 billion people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in 1960, so there was already a
billion increase compared to when
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Langhans was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was in the Netherlands,
I picked up on an inaugural address.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do in the Netherlands
when a new professor is installed in his
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give a speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave a speech, talk about this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentioned that if by 2050 we want
everybody, the 9 billion people that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be living on Earth, then we want everybody
to eat using European standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably not going to happen,
but he used it as a reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have the access to food and the quality
of the food that Europeans are accustomed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to triple our production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a tall order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said we may not get to European
levels, but that we have to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: production should be evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we have to deal with is
that we're not creating more land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have limited amount of area available
to grow our crops at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the different regions
of the world here, and you look
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly at the crop land,
so the brownish, orange-like bar here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that we have very limited areas
set aside for crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think on a world scale,
it's perhaps 0.2 hectares per person that
[SPEAKER_00]: is available for crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we add more people, of course,
that number becomes even smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land becomes a critical issue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, water is a very critical
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% of the Earth's water is available as
fresh water, readily available as fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that, by far the biggest part of
it, is consumed by agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a lot better in certain
irrigation systems in terms of efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as of now, a lot of that water that we
have available is used for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses, of course, allow for better
control of water uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, if you look at our
lettuce data, it requires 2.5 liters of
[SPEAKER_00]: water to grow one 5-ounce head of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a significant amount of water
that we need to grow a simple plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact remains that we need large
quantities of water to grow our crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we do it in a greenhouse or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse production comes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, around the time that Professor
Langhans was born, we saw a lot of cold
[SPEAKER_00]: frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that required a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a large crew there working.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Netherlands, we had greenhouses
specifically designed for seed grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so for consumption grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see also some older greenhouses on
the left-hand side for carnations and on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right-hand side for tomato production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a traditional, old-fashioned system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Professor Langhans came to Cornell in
the early 50s, Cornell looked something
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still park your car in front of
Willard Street, and there was a parking
[SPEAKER_00]: lot on the Ag Quad.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, Ken Post was still working at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see a picture of Ken Post from
1951, so a year before Professor Langhans
[SPEAKER_00]: came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the state of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to add to that, when I came in the
late 80s, the greenhouse didn't look much
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, some of them have improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about parking, if you live in a
densely populated area, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another example of the increase
in population growth and the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are faced with dealing with that
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the greenhouses,
we see lots of developments, lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that is in use today that
really make these very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated and high-tech systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to name some examples,
you see the greenhouse on the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: left-hand side, a design that doesn't use
any gutters anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse is designed so that the
glass panes, the very large glass panes,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually form a gutter themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trusses are not running across the
base, but are running in the length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bay, actually supporting the area where
normally the gutter would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truss is designed in such a way
that it provides a space for the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain to be stored in, again,
to try to maximize light transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: through this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very specific design features
that allow for maximum light transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: in this highly modern greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sophisticated, on the upper
right-hand side, we have sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see an entire table being moved
by a computerized system to an irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: station.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funnel there would be supplied with
the right amount of water and nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: for the gerbera crop to grow optimally in
this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the computer decides when the crop
needs irrigation and then moves the table
[SPEAKER_00]: to an irrigation station to provide it
with water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very sophisticated robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them flat fixtures that make sure
that every cell in a plug tray is filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with a viable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a camera system that inspects
the entire tray, a mechanical system that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes out the cells that were not
germinated or have diseased plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then refills those open spaces with
viable plants to make sure that when a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower sells a flat, 100% of the plants in
that flat are actually viable for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, on the lower
right-hand side, we have high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses in which plants are grown in
individual containers that are kept track
[SPEAKER_00]: of by a computer system so these plants
can be manipulated individually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse system for measurements and
handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very expensive but highly computerized
and automated systems to make sure we can
[SPEAKER_00]: handle plants very efficiently without
much human input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to come to some conclusions,
I think to help feed the growing world,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me it seems greenhouse food production
is going to be a critical component in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think despite the need and I
think the demonstrated capabilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I've tried to indicate in this talk,
there's limited funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think we don't have the support
from college administrators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in itself could be an entire
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you understand what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as a group, as a group of
scientists working in controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, we need to become stronger
advocates for greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to find a way to tell our
story better and to tell it to people that
[SPEAKER_00]: really matter and that can then take
action to help us with funding and help
[SPEAKER_00]: further the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area I think and I strongly
believe in this and where we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements is to increase our
collaborations locally, regionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you may have heard a lot of
discussion recently about vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily think vertical farming
is a bad idea, but I certainly don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to come up as a group
with a viable alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, and I get back to vertical
farming in a second, in addition I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to look at our inputs and we need
to look at the efficient use of our
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to reduce energy consumption and
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to increase the biodegradable
materials, the use of them, and we need
[SPEAKER_00]: more recycling in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on those issues,
but I don't think we do enough of it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if we don't, outsiders
will do it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course when outsiders start looking
at us, they may come up with different
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas and different outcomes and outcomes
that may not be always to the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to look at things like life
cycle assessments of our production
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we use a lot of energy,
we know significant resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly water, and we need to look at
the life cycle assessment of those
[SPEAKER_00]: production processes and include things
like carbon footprints and other
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impacts to come to a
transparent and fair assessment of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if we don't do that,
others will and others may question why
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using significant resources,
for example, to produce non-essentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a rose crop in a greenhouse or
perhaps even a lettuce crop in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse could be labeled by outsiders
as a non-essential crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if that happens, we're going
to have a long way fighting ourselves back
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to make sure that those
industries remain viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if once we get into a
negative consumer perception case,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are examples of that in our
industry, if we get to that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be very hard to fight those
perceptions and to get back on top again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to vertical farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this reference and some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think vertical farming is a new
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see an idea by a professor in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, from the early 60s looking at a
conveyor system in a vertical tower trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow crops using supplemental lighting
to help speed up production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think vertical farming is not a new
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see a modern version of what a
vertical farm looked like in an urban
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is you produce it close to
densely populated centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You produce it in a hydroponic,
system, but minimizing really the
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation distance between where you
produce it and where it's consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should ask Professor Albright to give
a talk because he can give a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: talk telling you that it's not a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to agree with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, it's an idea that's out
there and it's being promoted by lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I think we need to come up with
a viable alternative to counteract some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the forces that are trying to push this
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Albright says that an
alternative might be to look at what he
[SPEAKER_00]: calls peri-urban agriculture, so still
have food production close to large
[SPEAKER_00]: population centers, but not grow them
right inside the population center,
[SPEAKER_00]: but grow them at the perimeter,
so at the outside of the densely populated
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am proposing is, in addition to
that, to also revisit the idea of having
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses attached to residential living
spaces and not thinking about this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: afterthought where a greenhouse is put in
the backyard or a greenhouse is attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to a home like a sunroom, but really
looking at an integration of both the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse system with the living
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So involve architects and designers,
involve plant scientists, involve
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture engineers that know something
about greenhouses, and sit around a table
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop a system that takes benefit of
the heat that's being generated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and use that in the building
system, but obviously also provide for an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for the family or the
residents of the structure to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain number of crops in that space to
hopefully make them become less dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: on traditional supply chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only have to point to the recent
disaster that we had in New Jersey and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York with Hurricane Sandy to come to the
realization that it is important for most
[SPEAKER_00]: of us to realize how dependent we are on
some of these traditional supply chains
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shock that it creates when those
supply chains disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a major shock and it still is a
major shock to our system in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to take quite some time to
overcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there on Friday and the lights were
all dimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no fresh produce, and this is
almost two weeks after the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: no fresh produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cooling cases were emptied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no frozen products at all in
the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like a third world country that I
walked into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the disruption of an event like
what we had, and granted this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: happening too often, but we know it can
happen and we're faced with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that makes it all the more
relevant and all the more critical that we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at alternative ways of providing
ourselves with food and energy and other
[SPEAKER_00]: critical components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this picture that was made several
years ago by Van Gogh that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthens the theme that I wanted to
point out to, which is local and small
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps we need to revisit that idea and
how we can incorporate small agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: back into our modern way of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to close and I want to point out
that obviously I'm standing as I present
[SPEAKER_00]: to you here on many tall and giant
shoulders here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to express my gratitude for all
the work that was done for people that
[SPEAKER_00]: came before me, but also many colleagues
that I work with both here and elsewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: through my journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only research I'm familiar with is the
work that's being done in the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Arizona, and I'm not too familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Disney World in Florida has been
promoting aeroponics for quite some time
[SPEAKER_00]: and have shown that it can be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is that if the system fails,
if the pump doesn't pump and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate the roots continuously,
you have a very short amount of time in
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can react and respond and
overcome that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of having a system that can
deal with hiccups, which we always have in
[SPEAKER_00]: these complicated systems, it's delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think for commercial operations,
we haven't seen many people go that route,
[SPEAKER_00]: although we know that if the system
operates properly, they can be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple and lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just looked at pure efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at the amount of light that
was received by the crop and the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter production, and that's how I
compared the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pure from an efficiency point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mature apple trees, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to the Maltese reference to
get the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this works in the Netherlands,
but it may not work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you what they were doing in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reasons, of course, is that
scaling up for them makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to compete with imports from
other European countries, particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to stay in business with
this high tech expensive system,
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel that our only way out is to
scale up, to have more production area,
[SPEAKER_00]: to become more efficient with that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that may not work in our case,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I want to add is that I
think we have to be careful when we use
[SPEAKER_00]: the word sustainable, because it means
something different to different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the root of it is important,
and I agree too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think when I talk about
sustainability, it may mean something
[SPEAKER_00]: different than when you talk about
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to make sure that people
understand what sustainability is and from
[SPEAKER_00]: what point we're looking at it and how we
use it, we need to have a common
[SPEAKER_00]: definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the definition is being slowly
watered down at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the term is, I think, disputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with the concept, and it's
important that we look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the wording is perhaps something we
need to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's thank Ajay and get him down to the
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
