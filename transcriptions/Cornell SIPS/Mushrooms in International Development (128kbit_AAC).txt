[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here today to talk about mushrooms
and international development.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to travel to two unique
locations in the world, Bangladesh and
[SPEAKER_02]: Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangladesh was not all about mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go following love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to go visit my girlfriend Amanda
while she was collecting her data for her
[SPEAKER_02]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was also for adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of lessons that you can't
learn in the classroom and you can't find
[SPEAKER_02]: in the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was really excited for these sort
of experiential learning opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm interested to get into
international development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked Dr. Peter Hobbs, who some of
you may know, I asked him how I could
[SPEAKER_02]: become involved in international
agriculture development.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, Brian, you just got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to go there and get
experience and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also sort of an opportunity for my
own shameless self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hopefully graduate this May.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be looking for a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody knows a good opportunity,
I'd be happy to entertain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start by combating stereotypes
about mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms are the fruiting body in the
kingdom fungi, fungi of their own unique
[SPEAKER_02]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of players,
the good, the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And according to George Hudler,
no uglies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a number of uses, a number of
ways different mushrooms and fungi can
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to society in terms of human
health and ecological health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one stereotype we encounter a lot
here in the university is the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys need to get it out of your
system, maybe make a joke to your neighbor
[SPEAKER_02]: really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can move on from this
stereotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I first became interested in mushrooms
and reading this book, Mycelium Running,
[SPEAKER_02]: by Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Stamets, he's a rock star mycologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really very persuasive in sort of
convincing all the benefits that mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: can provide to society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the benefits include the
remediation of agriculture runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the top, you see a number of mushroom
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a number of potentially
disease-causing organisms that are often
[SPEAKER_02]: the result of wildlife and in rainwater
runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these mushrooms, when incorporated
into riparian buffers, have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: kill a number of these pathogens,
some of which are beginning to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotic resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain mushrooms are also capable of
remediating chemical contaminants as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of industrial activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really neat about these mushrooms
is that they have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolize these chemical contaminants,
rather than just absorb and translocate,
[SPEAKER_02]: as is common with more traditional
bioremediation strategies, plant-based
[SPEAKER_02]: bioremediation strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you see things in here like
organophosphates, pesticides, trinitra,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have toluene, that's TNT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a remarkable way to use a
living organism to sort of fix the damage
[SPEAKER_02]: we as humans have done to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms can also be used as pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most expensive mushroom in the world
is a member of the cordyceps genus,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It infects caterpillars in the Himalayan
Plateau in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, this is the most
expensive mushroom in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also certain cordyceps species
that will infect ants or grasshoppers,
[SPEAKER_02]: can really help to reduce economic,
reduce populations to a below an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms are also very beneficial in
human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a great ability to bridge the
gap between foods and medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of different disease
and disease pathologies that they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with affecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got citations for all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to talk more about this
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, there needs to be more
research done into the applied aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: mycology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to sort of explore the
interaction between both human and
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on to the journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangladesh first became a country in 1971.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, it was known as East Pakistan
after the 1947 British partition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But due to a number of factors,
not the least of which was geographic
[SPEAKER_02]: separation, Bangladesh fought for their
independence and gained that in 1971.
[SPEAKER_02]: There continue to be a number of political
issues in Bangladesh that have sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: affected its coming of age as a country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in addition to the political turmoil,
Bangladesh is also the site of the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations of naturally occurring
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the world, it infects the soil and
groundwater, and it has been described by
[SPEAKER_02]: some as a public health emergency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close to 50% of Bangladesh's population is
at risk of exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And traditional strategies rely on the
filtration from water, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly inhibited by access to
financial resources in terms of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: this technology out to the people who
really need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in doing my research for my master's
degree, I came across this paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mitigation of Arsenic-Mediated Stress in
Rats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it is a big jump from rats to
humans, this is very promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the light bulbs went off in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to explore this more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can mushrooms help Bangladesh?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I traveled to Bangladesh with two main
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the current state of mushroom
activities in Bangladesh, from an
[SPEAKER_02]: extension standpoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, are specialty mushrooms an
appropriate strategy in preventing arsenic
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the first question,
I knew a little bit of information going
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda had traveled to Bangladesh in the
year prior, and wanted me to come visit
[SPEAKER_02]: her the next time she would be traveling
to Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, hey, find something with
mushrooms, and I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she was able to come up with the
National Mushroom Development and
[SPEAKER_02]: Extension Center, which engages in
research activities to promote a national
[SPEAKER_02]: collection of useful mushrooms,
human resource, and agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: development training, researching quality
parameters of products and production
[SPEAKER_02]: tools to enhance branding and
verification, expanding consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness, in addition to increasing
consumer interest in order to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: trade relationships for an export-driven
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what she found, and I was there
to explore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their mission statement that I
just read to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they describe export-driven
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of curiosity, does anybody have
any opinion on the goal of export-driven
[SPEAKER_02]: development versus regional development in
terms of novel crops, such as mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be for anything, especially
high-value horticulture products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody has an opinion on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be the only one talking
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So
[SPEAKER_02]: well, the goal of export, is it
exploitation?
[SPEAKER_02]: In shooting for the goal of an
export-driven development opportunity,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you exploiting environment and people,
or can you really help people with an
[SPEAKER_02]: export-driven goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people believe that
export-driven development strategies are
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be happy to talk with anybody after
the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the National Mushroom Development and
Extension Center, currently there are 16
[SPEAKER_02]: sub-centers located throughout the
Republic of Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The center is in Savar, the main center.
[SPEAKER_02]: The facility was started in 1979 and
experienced a significant lag phase until
[SPEAKER_02]: 2003, when they began to gear up
production systems, thanks to grants from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Asian Development Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2009, the Japanese Development Bank
gave another grant to the Extension
[SPEAKER_02]: Center, promoting their current capacity
of the 16 sub-centers and making it a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the national extension system in
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I should mention is that
literally translated, the word mushroom in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangla is frog umbrella.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may give you sort of a hint on how
people will accept mushrooms as a food
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after arriving in Dhaka, we traveled to
the southern district of Noakali and I
[SPEAKER_02]: hired a translator and spent the time
roaming the countryside pursuing my own
[SPEAKER_02]: interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that several former mushroom
farmers, no current mushroom farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: who told us that when they were selling
mushrooms, they would sell for about 200
[SPEAKER_02]: taka per kilogram fresh and 2,000 taka per
kilogram dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taka is the currency of Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's roughly 80 taka to a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a pretty high-value product and
maybe not within the purchasing capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: of many rural households.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mentioned that obstacles to the
expansion of their enterprise included
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of acceptance of mushrooms as a food
product, lack of profitable market
[SPEAKER_02]: outlets, and unreliability or poor quality
of spawn that was being sold to them by
[SPEAKER_02]: either the National Extension Center or
private enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was promise that they
recognized, they began to cultivate
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms because they recognized the
unique properties mushrooms contain as a
[SPEAKER_02]: food item.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the gentlemen we spoke to began
cultivating mushrooms because his father
[SPEAKER_02]: was sick and he wanted to grow mushrooms
because he thought the mushrooms would
[SPEAKER_02]: help his father get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you see this in the more educated
individuals that they can recognize and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the benefit that mushrooms can
have in the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following our visit in Nuocli,
and there were a couple other experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: in this region, while I was in Nuocli,
we traveled to Kamila, which is another
[SPEAKER_02]: city in Bangladesh, and visited this
Kamila substation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they were currently producing
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold for 130 taka per kilogram fresh
and 1,500 taka per kilogram dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they explained to me a little bit
about the training that growers must go
[SPEAKER_02]: through to be a part of this extension
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three-day training program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers or people are paid 600 taka to
attend the training, and then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: given 25 free spawn bags to begin their
own enterprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really a big push to get these
farmers to attend the meetings,
[SPEAKER_02]: a great incentive, 600 taka.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of the rural day laborers we
talked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their daily wages range from 200 taka to
500 taka per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is potentially three days
worth of wage by coming to this training
[SPEAKER_02]: session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they learn to grow mushrooms or
not, they were there and they got paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the farmers go through the
training, maybe a week or two afterwards,
[SPEAKER_02]: the extension agents will visit their
farms and provide troubleshooting advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they aren't able to sell their
mushrooms, then the extension center will
[SPEAKER_02]: buy the mushrooms from them, usually in
the dried form, at whatever the prevailing
[SPEAKER_02]: market rate is.
[SPEAKER_02]: During this time, we were also able to
visit the Feni substation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feni is another city in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the way to this station, we came across
a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd been in the pharmacy trade for
roughly 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he hadn't been to formal
medical school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, he was referred to as a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a doctor within the village.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he prescribed pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used a pharmaceutical in his practice,
one drug that was a mushroom-derived
[SPEAKER_02]: product from Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2005, during the caretaker government,
he wasn't able to access this medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: decided then that he would grow his own
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now mind you, this doctor was a former
mushroom grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he cited limited market development
as his main obstacle in developing this
[SPEAKER_02]: enterprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Narikal Bagan is the name of the
sub-center in Feni.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means coconut garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a number of coconut trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were evaluating for different
parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we got to eat a lot of coconuts
during this visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to the director of the
sub-center, who described a failure of
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptance as a food item, lack of
markets, failure to create a systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: production system, and poor retention of
growers in the training program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see this big national program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's having trouble getting off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about some of the
strategies for the next visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the positive impacts of
mushroom production is that it can be done
[SPEAKER_02]: in sort of a local village level.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of Muslim communities women are
confined to the cloister or the group of
[SPEAKER_02]: houses that surround their own household.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't permitted to travel to markets
or leave this tight village area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so mushrooms, you don't have to go out
to the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go to the field to
cultivate mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it in your backyard or next to
your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there have been a couple of papers
that suggest mushroom enterprise may be a
[SPEAKER_02]: method of gender-sensitive development.
[SPEAKER_02]: A way to empower women in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met with one woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: This picture is, I took that picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not from the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met with this woman who, she was
engaged in mushroom production,
[SPEAKER_02]: but said that she didn't know if it was a
profitable enterprise because her husband
[SPEAKER_02]: took care of all the financial matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I posed the question,
is this really a gender-sensitive
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do they need to tweak it a little?
[SPEAKER_02]: So following, after a number of different
experiences later on in the fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to visit the center in Savar
and met with the national director of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushroom Development Program, Dr. Neeraj
Chandrasekhar.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Savar, it's the primary stage of
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to establish processing and
production technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they maintain a very close
relationship with India, China,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the source of all their germplasm
for the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all exotic species that are
being imported into Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if they were able to isolate locally
growing species that may be more
[SPEAKER_02]: culturally adapted, environmentally
adapted, they may have more success in
[SPEAKER_02]: their production systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the shape of the oyster mushroom was
throwing off consumers if they found
[SPEAKER_02]: something more recognizable to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may want to eat it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's really a big obstacle
of perception with mushrooms in Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_02]: as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of advertising programs
on the radio and television trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: promote the benefits of mushroom as a food
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the people I talked to
suggested that this was making a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few papers out saying it's
making a difference in promoting mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still skeptical that they are
actually making an impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to conclude that section a little
bit, Bangladesh Harbor is a very robust
[SPEAKER_02]: extension system for promoting mushroom
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very top-down oriented program
coming from international entities to the
[SPEAKER_02]: local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so mushrooms can be produced in a
variety of scales and methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can produce it on the household level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here in the United States,
they're all produced on a big,
[SPEAKER_02]: huge industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure why they chose
mushrooms as a development opportunity and
[SPEAKER_02]: why it's received so much funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It very much seemed like they were trying
to force mushrooms on the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then here in the Chittagong Hilltrak
region, and I'll talk about this region a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more, this is an area,
a very high concentration of indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnicities that are probably more closely
related to the Burmese, Myanmar folks than
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual people that make up the
population of Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they love mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are very eager and readily consume
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward, maybe the extension
centers should concentrate their efforts
[SPEAKER_02]: in this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's some tension between the
Bangalas and the indigenous ethnicities in
[SPEAKER_02]: several areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually had the opportunity to work
there, working with a Spanish NGO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll get to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I was in Noakli, we were able to
travel around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to develop the agriculture
context.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to learn how farmers were,
how they farmed, what they used.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we were in Noakli, this is Dr.
Shandra Charkar in Savar, a few pictures
[SPEAKER_02]: of mushrooms that they were growing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the pink oyster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pink, but it doesn't really taste
very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are rishi mushrooms being grown near
Feni.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was one of the most prolific growers
in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had 2,000 of these spawn bags that you
can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is rice paddy straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they harvest the rice, and then the
stubble's left in the field, and they will
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also some of the rice crops
they'll grow are just for the vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and not for the rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll use that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the great things about oyster
mushrooms is you can grow it on just about
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan can attest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it on toilet paper rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it on coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it on crude oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a very, very interesting
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the Feni office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see that education was a big
factor in adoption of mushroom growing
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could say that mushrooms make you
more educated, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that education can promote the
adoption of mushroom growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we can suggest that an
education program in Bangladesh as a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the complementary goals would
be that people would eat more mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, I was able to spend some
time in Noakli talking with farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how they farmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the markets, market vendors were
generally very knowledgeable about product
[SPEAKER_02]: origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can tell you what town it was from,
what country it was from, if it was
[SPEAKER_02]: imported or domestic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one problem is the post-harvest
storage and handling of high-value
[SPEAKER_02]: perishable horticulture commodities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Formalin use is widespread in the value
chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys know formalin?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used to preserve cadavers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's used to keep the produce from
rotting from when they buy it in the local
[SPEAKER_02]: market and transport it to the urban
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about rural-urban connections
in terms of urban food security.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in providing that food to the urban
populations, there may be greater risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also reports of people using
calcium carbide and etaphon for fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening, both of which are not permitted
for edible crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are public health risks in
the horticulture value chain in Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_02]: that very seriously need to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people understand these risks and do
not want to eat formalin-contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate that it's mostly only the
upper classes that are able to avoid this
[SPEAKER_02]: risk because grocery stores have branded
their products as formalin-free and will
[SPEAKER_02]: charge a premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Nuwakli, we encountered a number of
nongovernmental groups engaged in
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and extension development.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see up top, this is a focus group
organized by the Nuwakli Rural Development
[SPEAKER_02]: Society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this society performs duties similar
to an extension agent, except they focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on smallholder farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide seeds, facilitate microcredit
opportunity, organize farmers and to
[SPEAKER_02]: groups, they provide tractors,
and arrange for cooperation within
[SPEAKER_02]: regions, and disseminate information and
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talked in this focus group,
the farmers, you ask farmers what their
[SPEAKER_02]: problems are, and you better have your
tape recorder on because farmers love to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about how their lives could be
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mentioned very few storage options
for perishable goods that can't be sold at
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter is the most productive season for
them, but yet they're limited by access to
[SPEAKER_02]: water resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter is the dry season in Bangladesh,
and they, like I said, were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you think with this flooded, all these
flooded rice paddies that water wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be an issue, but in the dry season it can
become a very serious issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other complaints were lack of
transportation infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_02]: limited educational opportunities for
their children, problems with soil
[SPEAKER_02]: salinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lack of access to capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down here in the bottom left, we were
talking with a gentleman who led an IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: club.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a group of farmers who try to
disseminate sustainable technologies for
[SPEAKER_02]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like pheromone traps were very
popular within this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the leader, this is a translated
quote, he said that waiting on government
[SPEAKER_02]: extension service providers is a dark
hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've really sort of given up on the
government service providers and providing
[SPEAKER_02]: extension services to their agriculture
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was, mind you, this was all in
Naukali, in the southern district.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so upon hearing this, I said,
well, hey, why don't we go talk to the
[SPEAKER_02]: extension officers?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we met with an Upazila agriculture
officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upazila is just one of their districts,
a sub-district.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the hierarchy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you rattle it off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody else knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just how they arranged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we met with the Upazila agriculture
officer whose primary duty is,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is self-reporting, supported primary
duties include, thank you, include
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer distribution, reporting on
agriculture activities, and monitoring the
[SPEAKER_02]: block officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why is a government agent involved
in fertilizer distribution?
[SPEAKER_02]: They can probably, well, anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this agent was not from the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't from Naukali.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was from another part of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't know the region very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of his main problems, he advises
farmers on pest management strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But many farmers will come in with what
they think are pest management issues that
[SPEAKER_02]: really turn out to be soil nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's really a lack of soil testing
facilities in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the farmers will get their advice
from the local shopkeeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the shopkeeper, his first question
isn't, what is your problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you done?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question is, how much money do
you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the shopkeeper will sell the
farmers a product based on, not on their
[SPEAKER_02]: problems, but how much money they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they've got a lot of money,
he'll sell them an expensive chemical or
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he doesn't have a lot of money,
then he won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are a list of the pesticides that
farmers said they were using in Naukali.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to highlight one right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindane has been banned in every part of
the world except for India and Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to killing insects,
it also kills people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's been discontinued for sale in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found one farmer that was using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other problems is many of the
farmers can't read.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have these highly technical
pesticide labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they aren't able to understand the
directions and how to apply these
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, there's no PPE, personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very readily available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably three chemical and seed
shops to every locality.
[SPEAKER_02]: After talking with the Upazila agriculture
officer, we went and found the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: protection officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said his duties were organizing farmer
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also grants the pesticide shop
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says farmer training are organized into
small, medium, and large farm groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 70% of the farmers in Naukali fall
in this small group.
[SPEAKER_02]: A small farm group, 25 in the medium and
5% in the large.
[SPEAKER_02]: Landless farmers, sharecroppers,
are grouped into the large farmer group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that makes sense or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four basic subsidies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fertilizer and pesticide are the entirety
of the money directed to the Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemical Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diesel and equipment subsidies are direct
deposited into farmers' bank accounts by
[SPEAKER_02]: the Ministry of Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a farmer needs to have a bank account
to be eligible for this money.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's subsidies to seed and seedling
producers, which is directed to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangladesh Agriculture Development
Commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's price setting subsidies
for rice and pulse products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I miss anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So following, we did get to visit
Ashugansh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that right, Amanda?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we found almost a success of the
extension workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked with the district assistant
district supervisor of the extension
[SPEAKER_02]: activities for this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked with a number of different
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them complained.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew their block officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talked with the extension agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what the district officer said was
that this region is more industrially
[SPEAKER_02]: oriented than agriculturally oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think what we see in New Akali is
just there's too many farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The extension officers are overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, there's an appropriate number of
extension officers to farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they can develop a more personal
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy was in the CNG with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: CNG is like natural gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a three-wheeled cart that you
can take between villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a man going around selling these
snakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that if he got bit, he had the
vaccine so that he wouldn't get poisoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting to see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brings them out, smacks them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffs up his hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: One farm we visited had a pet deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are deer common in Bangladesh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like an endemic thing in the New
Akali region?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wearing a collar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is clearly somebody's pet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't really have anything to do
with anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to show you the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Chittagong Hill Tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: During my time in Bangladesh, I was able
to get a consulting position with a
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish NGO working in this region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an agriculture technical expert
working on rainwater harvesting techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: for dry season agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of their project to
strengthening socioeconomic rights of
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous women in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I took this position on, I didn't
know a lot about rainwater harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people had thought that they would
have the rain barrels from the harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff from buildings and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of the buildings in this area
were thatched roofs, not tin roofs that
[SPEAKER_02]: harbor a number of microbial contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, I really became aware of
Cornell not just as a brand and
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizable name, but there's actually
professors here that are here to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: help when you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Norman Uphoff and Dr. Peter Hobbs and
a number of the staff here provided some
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible resources that helped me in
this position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so essentially what we were doing,
we were working in the Lama Alikadam area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's characterized, like I said,
by high populations of indigenous groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Household income is dependent on
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The traditional system of cultivation is
called jume or jume.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shifting cultivation, otherwise
known as slash and burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the villages, due to increasing
land pressure, these villages would
[SPEAKER_02]: traditionally have a 30 to 50 year
rotation now because of increased land
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shortened to three to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil and the ecology doesn't have a
chance to recover this soil organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: and soil nutrient capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've got serious problems with
erosion and loss of livelihoods almost
[SPEAKER_02]: because they fall into this cycle of
poverty where traditional cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: practices result in reduced soil
fertility, decreasing vigor of crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: their resulting progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these villages save their seeds,
further contributing to lower productivity
[SPEAKER_02]: and resulting in reduced wages and food
insecurity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my goal was to encourage more
perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a companion planting guide that we
gave to the, so I was working with a local
[SPEAKER_02]: implementing agency, Teranga, I think is
what they were called, and they had their
[SPEAKER_02]: own agriculture officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was helping to train the agriculture
officers who would then disseminate this
[SPEAKER_02]: information to the local villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in determining projects to implement,
can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: In determining projects to implement,
we were able to go around and interview
[SPEAKER_02]: the villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to engage in a participatory
approach to determine who needed what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what their needs were and work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We introduced a number of solutions that
came from this publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can see that, implementing
integrated natural resource management
[SPEAKER_02]: projects under the National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: The National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act is an act in India that basically
[SPEAKER_02]: provides 100 days of paid labor to rural
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there were a number of strategies
for rainwater harvesting and soil water
[SPEAKER_02]: retention that came from this publication
that took place in Eastern India,
[SPEAKER_02]: very close, right on the Bangladesh
border.
[SPEAKER_02]: So appropriate technologies that have been
developed in a similar region and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced these to the localities and
they were able to decide what they wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some cost sharing arrangements
with the implementing organization and the
[SPEAKER_02]: locality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't just sort of a donation here,
we'll put in, you know, a pond for you for
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the, the villagers were engaged in
the problem and the solution and
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes paid to, paid for their labor
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a number of the strategies were based
on the slope of the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: We encountered all of these different
slopes within the villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, a few of the more isolated
villages were living exclusively on this
[SPEAKER_02]: 8% and greater slope area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, like I said, a number of
different slopes and each strategy depends
[SPEAKER_02]: on the slope for its appropriate
strategies to try and just hold the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: hold the ground, hold the water in,
in serious moisture events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's pictures from the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my, my friend Nico.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a pond we dug or helped to dig
with, with one of the local groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this is maybe two or three
days after we dug the pond and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: already got more than a meter of water in
the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a gully plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the same village which so when,
when the rain falls, you get these
[SPEAKER_02]: channels being cut out of the hill and
these gully plugs are put in place to slow
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground, slow the water so that it
reduces erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually you'll get like, the soil will
build up behind the gully plug and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have a flat space to cultivate your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of this rich organic topsoil
that has fallen from the rest of the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, these are some of the
strategies we worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, like I said, you know,
mushrooms were commonly consumed in this
[SPEAKER_02]: area, but I didn't really see the
presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, I think, two of the extension
centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this area, travel by foreigners is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get a special pass to enter
the Chittagong Hill tracks and you are not
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be working when you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was all volunteer, so it wasn't
working per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's a, there's a lot of turmoil
in this region that I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just sort of reflecting on my
experience in Bangladesh, it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, I mean, it was a great country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of great experiences,
but I think in terms of the mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was a very top-down oriented
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in, in Rwanda, I worked for a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: aid, HORT, CRISP, Trellis Fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: CRISP is Critical Research Support Program
and the Trellis Fund engages graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: students, provides funds for them to
travel for two weeks to 13, 14 different
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you only get to travel to one
country and work with one NGO in that
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was paired with Sustaining Rwanda Youth
Organization and they had identified
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom cultivation as a mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hoping to improve household food
security and provide rural enterprise for
[SPEAKER_02]: one village that they work with and near
Butari, the southern, in the southern
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I arrived in Rwanda,
I spent the first week traveling to a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of different mushroom, people
engaged in the mushroom industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms are very popular in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered a high value food item
that's associated with significant
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday, Sunday, everybody goes to church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat mushrooms for Easter or other
religious holidays, baptisms, they'll eat
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it was once very
expensive, but now it's about half the
[SPEAKER_02]: price of meat in the market and it's quite
readily available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a group we met with that had
their own mushroom lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody cultivates oyster mushroom
because it's the easiest to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This group was started from what's called
a seed fund from the UN development
[SPEAKER_02]: program to start their own enterprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do grow some mushrooms, but mostly
they're tasked with education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they work with a couple of groups
throughout the country that are more
[SPEAKER_02]: technically oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this group was very education
oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kigali Farms is probably our most helpful
partner in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to, like it says,
bring affordable, high impact crops to
[SPEAKER_02]: Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the COO of Kigali Farms was
a former CFO of Omagang Brewery just down
[SPEAKER_02]: the road in Cooperstown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he asked me to bring him a bottle of
the Abbe Ale that we shared when we met
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're trying to provide this is
really neat because they were trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're promoting mushroom cultivation in
rural areas and then buying a mushroom and
[SPEAKER_02]: providing a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they have solar dryers to extend the
shelf life of the mushrooms so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can impact and access more markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bein Producers was probably the biggest
mushroom producer, mushroom distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a wholesaler in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a retail outlet in probably the
biggest market in Kigali, the capital
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we did hear rumors that they
weren't actually paying their growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were just taking the mushrooms
and writing an IOU.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Nirbutari, there's the Rubona
Agriculture Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a partnership with the Chinese
government and a demonstration of Chinese
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the media sterilizer they were
using to sterilize their bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use an elephant grass media is what
they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really tall grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it in the background here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows 11, 12 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the spawn bags that they were
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a subsidized, these bags are way
below the market price for other,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kigali Farms produces spawn bags and they
sell them for 400 Rwandan francs for a
[SPEAKER_02]: bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rubona Experiment Station sells them
for 300 Rwandan francs per bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to sell them for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could give them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do, especially when it's program
targeted for rural enterprise development.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we visited all the farms,
if you see here, one thing I learned in
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting these farms was just how they
grow mushrooms in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because mushrooms require a high moisture
capacity, high moisture content,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very difficult to control,
to create a controlled atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll put the mushroom bags into the
soil so they can regulate soil moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: much better than they can regulate
atmospheric moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I offered a training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent about an hour talking what is a
mushroom, providing marketing advice and
[SPEAKER_02]: technical production advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we built a pilot plot behind this
community church so that women could see
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave them maybe 50 bags to cultivate as
a community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The training was targeted at a women's
cooperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rwanda is a very cooperative country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're identified as having malnourished
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're invited to attend a maternal and
child feeding class.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 10-week class.
[SPEAKER_02]: After completing the class, they are
invited to join the cooperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you become a cooperative in Rwanda,
you're given a savings account and
[SPEAKER_02]: formally recognized by the Rwandan
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're given a certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a savings account for which they
could promote microcredit activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was targeted by the Sustaining Rwanda
Youth Organization for a number of rural
[SPEAKER_02]: enterprise activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following the training, we bought some
mushrooms and brought them to this
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: The women, we all cooked them together and
then shared lunch after following the
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a really nice mushroom curry
with peanut flour, onions and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other rural enterprises that we
witnessed in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a wooden cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's intricately carved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all sorghum that's being malted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of home brewing and beer
brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer production in the rural areas of
Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't try any.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I regret that or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reflections on the Rwanda experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Market access in our specific project was
limited by household consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a bad thing or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects the sustainability of the
project because they aren't able to
[SPEAKER_02]: generate income, but they're also getting
a nutritious food source in their
[SPEAKER_02]: household.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sustaining Rwanda Youth Organization,
the director and some of their volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was with a different volunteer every
day, which was nice, but they weren't able
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop the technical capacity that
they needed to encourage this enterprise
[SPEAKER_02]: in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some serious issues with
termites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to suggest biocontrol options.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they were able to get a
hold of those biocontrol options or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really difficult to determine what
impact my time in Rwanda made with the
[SPEAKER_02]: people in Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a profound experience for me,
but I don't know what impact I had in the
[SPEAKER_02]: locality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparing the two, Rwanda was a little bit
easier to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there are some very serious
issues with ethnic issues in Rwanda,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the government has made laws saying
that you cannot differentiate between the
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnicities and public media.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rwanda experience and their history is
tragic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really looking forward to
look beyond that and really work together
[SPEAKER_02]: at being one Rwanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legacy of mushroom consumption in
Rwanda was very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's viewed as a high-value product with a
considerable demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking to the future, I think more work
on monitoring and evaluating mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: enterprise, especially in Rwanda,
is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information right now
about biochar, whether it works or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have different views.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in planting the mushrooms in the soil
like we saw in Rwanda, you really are
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing the soil organic matter and
could potentially pave the way for more
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial cropping systems, such as tree
fruits and agroforestry-related systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what is the role in the government,
other agencies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote inhibiting up there because in
subsidizing their spawn bags, is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rwanda Extension Service, are they
inhibiting appropriate market development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how do you introduce innovation to a
rural community without having them be
[SPEAKER_02]: dependent on you giving input?
[SPEAKER_02]: After they ate all the mushrooms,
they said, okay, can we have some more
[SPEAKER_02]: spawn bags now?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, well, we don't have any money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the project sort of ended at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you introduce a new idea without
the people becoming dependent on your
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I've got today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of agriculture inputs,
there's pretty heavy transportation costs
[SPEAKER_02]: that are associated with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of ammonium nitrate
available in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: To differentiate the agriculture mushrooms
for agriculture inputs, I think it'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I don't know, how do you incorporate
it into the market-based system to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: out to the people?
[SPEAKER_02]: There definitely could be opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know what it would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be better if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a paired cooking component with
food
[SPEAKER_01]: work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetable consumption in Bangladesh was
not very common around the time of their
[SPEAKER_02]: independence.
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding is that once people
started working going to Saudi Arabia and
[SPEAKER_02]: other countries to seek employment,
they started bringing back the tradition
[SPEAKER_02]: of vegetable consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that way, it's more of the organic,
ground-up adoption of these habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there would be an
education program that could combat the
[SPEAKER_02]: obstacle of perceptions of mushrooms in
Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you were asking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangladesh is a very densely populated
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Space is a constraint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we were only seeing substrate
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, a lot of the wood is used for fuel
for cooking fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really that abundance of
forest resources that we see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bangladesh, everything's got a use,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to identify a substrate,
an appropriate substrate, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me?
Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Nari Kalbhagan is in Phinney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did go to-
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cold storage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was one of the questions for
your second question first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers were selling their mushrooms in
their village.
