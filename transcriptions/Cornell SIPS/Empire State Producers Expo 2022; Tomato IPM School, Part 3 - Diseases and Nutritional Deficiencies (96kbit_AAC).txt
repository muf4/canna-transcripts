[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in addition to being a plant
pathologist, have an administrative role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been, to be quite frank,
a rather rough administrative week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy to be talking about
tomatoes and research this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I previously taught introductory plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I would always say
is that tomatoes have about 100 diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: that attack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that seems like a lot, and it is a
lot, so many diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that the most common
ones, there's probably only five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: really common diseases that we see each
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming down from 100, five or six does
not seem so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start with a bit of a
timeline, because right now, this time of
[SPEAKER_00]: year, what we're doing in our research
greenhouses is we're sanitizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow all of our transplants for our
research experiments in our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want the transplants to be really
healthy going into the field, because for
[SPEAKER_00]: my research, I want the plants to become
infected with the pathogen that I
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really critical that the plants
are healthy going into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, as a grower, it's also really
critical that your plants are healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they start out unhealthy,
it's not going to vastly improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start with the best possible
scenario that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So San and I sanitize the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a picture of that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we sanitize benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sanitize the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a concrete floor on the greenhouse
that we grow most of our transplants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have greenhouses that do have
gravel floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would sanitize those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellising stakes, I will bring up several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sanitizing trellising stakes is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, anything that touches the
transplant, whether that's flats or pots
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything that might end up touching a
transplant, you're really going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing this time of
year, or actually a couple of months ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to be thinking about is when
you're selecting your cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, if you had a significant
disease outbreak in your tomatoes last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, you're going to want to think about
looking for resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're going to tell me
that the resistant cultivars are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that consumers like myself always
want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had an outbreak and had a lot
of yield loss last year, a resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, at least in part of your crop,
is really going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing I always ask in my
introductory plant pathology is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to control plant diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students, nine-tenths of the
students will say you spray fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The absolute best way to control plant
diseases is using cultural practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes the use of resistant
varieties that plant breeders have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very hard to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is your first and best line of
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important strategies for disease
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start here, and then we're
going to get into some images of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with clean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clean seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are really beautiful extension
publications on hot water treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have helped tomato growers that are
concerned in particular about bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, hot water treat their seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the length of time and the exact
temperature are very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are considering hot water seed
treatment, you really want an extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate thermometer and timer because you
don't want to leave them in that hot water
[SPEAKER_00]: too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your greenhouse and all of the
materials associated with transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And field production, including Charleston
steaks, even if you had no disease last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pathogens are tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can survive in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might have had some bacteria on
the leaves in the greenhouse, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it out in the field and
it was, okay, this might not be true for
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, but let's say it was really
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That disease would never have developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that pathogen could still be surviving
in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaning the greenhouse every year,
even if you had no disease last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really a great way to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sanitizers work equally well,
as long as you follow the label and really
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, clean the debris from the
greenhouse or the trellising stake prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sanitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as soon as that sanitizer,
whether it's a green shield or a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, as soon as any of them hit organic
matter, they're going to become inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to clean up all of that plant
debris, anything that might be covering up
[SPEAKER_00]: where the sanitizer might need to get to
the sanitizer wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact that pathogen, kill it,
and then become inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep our floors clean, eliminate weeds,
as I said previously, new or clean flats,
[SPEAKER_00]: and raise flats above the ground if you
can, and always scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of Holly Lang,
a former technician, sanitizing our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benches that we had at the time,
you can see they had quite a bit of rust
[SPEAKER_00]: on the frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she would just take a pump sprayer
and spray right along the edges and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those nooks and crannies where bacteria or
fungal spores might like to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she would spray each of the benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would also spray the gate,
grate, and as well as the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would sweep out the greenhouse ahead of
time to remove any organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would clean all of the surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for flats or pots that might be
touching transplants, we actually dip
[SPEAKER_00]: those into a sterilant such as green
shield or zero tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture that I took in a
tomato transplant production facility in
[SPEAKER_00]: California some time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it illustrates nicely the idea
of if there is a disease, one plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: this facility that gets a pathogen,
gets a disease with the overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation, how tightly packed things are,
and the high humidity, that pathogen will
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to spread through these millions
of plants really quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scouting, and this person right here,
I was able to talk to him, his entire job,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 hours a week, was walking through the
transplant production facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identifying where there's a disease early
on is going to enable you to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, get rid of the plants around it,
because the pathogen has probably already
[SPEAKER_00]: spread to them, and move forward so that
the rest of your transplants do not get
[SPEAKER_00]: diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize that most of us don't grow 8
million tomato transplants at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but the concepts are true whether
you're growing 200 plants or 2 million
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogens can be seed-borne,
which is why it's important to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: One infected seed in 10,000 can start an
epidemic in a greenhouse with these
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathogens can spread rapidly,
so scouting is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing at this time of
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of the next steps after getting
the plants into the field are,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what diseases might we expect to see
first?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we see first
frequently in the year are bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering, and Kim will put up a
poll, how often do you see symptoms like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're seeing here on these tomato
fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you see those on your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most years, occasionally, never,
or you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it looks like we are
stabilizing around some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few folks every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple folks are fortunate that they
have not seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kim can enter that and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can see where we landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, it looks like, see bacterial
diseases some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: the three common bacterial diseases we
have here in New York are shown from left
[SPEAKER_00]: to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial speck, which is named because
the lesion on the fruit is very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial speck, the bacterium that causes
this particular disease, really thrives
[SPEAKER_00]: during cool seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial canker is the bacterial pathogen
that over the years I've seen the most
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New York has a very characteristic
lesion that I'll show several more times
[SPEAKER_00]: with that dark center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be tan to brown center with that
white halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a bird's eye lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common, as I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial canker likes cooler weather,
but it'll show up in most seasons unless
[SPEAKER_00]: it's extremely hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bacterial spot is the pathogen we
see, bacterial disease we see most,
[SPEAKER_00]: least frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it really likes the
really warm, wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get like hurricane remnants
with those hot, blowing rains,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's common to see bacterial spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we manage bacterial diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to put this here before I
show a few more images because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good to have some of these management
strategies in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irrigation management is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to water early in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually true for management
of any pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more dry a leaf is, the less chances
you are to have a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you water early in the day so that the
plants are dry by nightfall, then if there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a dew in the night, you'll spread that
leaf wetness out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want dry leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want good air movement, which helps
keep the leaves dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to walk through the
field or prune greenhouse transplants when
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves are wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when those leaves are wet is when
especially bacterial disease, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria themselves can be on the
surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you walk by, the bacteria are
going to stick to you and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to transfer those to the next
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before, we want to make sure we
clean the trellising stakes and copper can
[SPEAKER_00]: help prevent spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amara, were you going to jump in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you like you were going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned my video on just to be more
friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, can I ask a quick question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Marion.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are the bacteria getting into the
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bacteria, it depends on which
pathogen we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show some images in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they generally will enter either
through the wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's an insect feeding or a hail
damage or the stomates, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: pores on the leaves that enable the plant
to breathe or the hydathodes, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny holes around the edge of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria are really tricky that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the fruit, we actually know that
the bacteria will get on the fruit and
[SPEAKER_00]: will enter in when the fruit is very young
in little cracks that are in the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: when the fruit is a very young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not inoculate this particular tomato
plant that has bacteria, this tomato fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: that has bacterial canker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trellising stake next to it had
bacteria on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture just shows how we know
that bacteria can transfer from the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising stake to a tomato fruit or a
tomato leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I have a colleague at Ohio
State who the way that she inoculates her
[SPEAKER_00]: research plots with bacterial pathogens
every year is to simply use the trellising
[SPEAKER_00]: stakes from the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the season, she pulls up
those trellising stakes, tosses them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next season, gets them back out,
uses them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all she has to do to inoculate
her field plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be enough to convince you to
disinfect those trellising stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we actually bought a
trough that one would use for water for
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put disinfectant in that trough and
use the trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dunk our stakes in that trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leave our stakes in the disinfectant,
the sterilant, for about 10 to 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll put we want to make sure that
all of the stakes are in contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably only put about 25 stakes in
at a time just to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know for how long is that
disinfectant usable?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not tried these, but I know
there are test kits that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: use to see if your disinfectant is still
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tend to use it for about about we
use it for about 200 stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use it for eight batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do clean our stakes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no organic matter left on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we assume that there are still there's
still organic matter in the nooks and
[SPEAKER_00]: crannies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to get a few more images.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bacterial diseases before I move
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial canker, the bacterium that
causes bacterial canker is somewhat unique
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will actually travel through
the veins of the plant and in the xylem
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, the water conducting vesicle
vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will clog those vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the edge of the leaf right
here, this necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said earlier, the the pathogen
can actually enter in tiny holes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: along the edges of these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you that's how it develops
this necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One tricky thing is that a lot of things
can cause marginal necrosis on a tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that marginal necrosis by itself is it
is not, oh, I have marginal necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely bacterial canker because
other things can cause that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bird's eye lesions on the fruit are
an absolute diagnostic sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else that causes lesions
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from a farm that did not
recognize that it had bacterial canker and
[SPEAKER_00]: it just turned into a total loss of this
tomato field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants wilted and all of the fruit had
some symptoms, some lesion on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which made it unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to show you was
just sort of what what does this bacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yellow and it's slimy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can imagine how if that were in
the water conducting vessel of your
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, it might clog it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial speck is the other bacterial
pathogen that we have seen frequently in
[SPEAKER_00]: recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until 2009, we really almost never saw it
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, we had a very cool wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year since then, we've had some
bacterial speck in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the lesions are very
small, but do make the fruit unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is particularly severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here I like this image because
there are a lot of leaves that don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can see there's one leaf that
does have symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we don't yet know why why
it is that this leaf really the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to enter compared to the one
right next door to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the questions that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that bacterial speck that actually
all of the bacterial pathogens do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to survive on farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that they can also and do
also arrive in seed or transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the bacteria will spread by wind
blown rain and water splashing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I want to
highlight, I frequently get asked,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how come on my tomato plant,
some of the fruit will have those
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial spots and others won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is the timing when
the bacteria land on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the bacteria land on a tomato fruit
when it's less than one inch in diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so less than roughly the size of a golf
ball, you're going to end up seeing spots
[SPEAKER_00]: on that fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacteria can actually enter even
when the flower is wide open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tiny fruit is just starting to
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can enter there and those lesions will
stay on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you see when the fruit is
fully mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the fruit gets to be larger than one
inch in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a student that graduated not too
long ago, and he actually took the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial canker pathogen with a
paintbrush and painted it on to all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of tomato fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once those fruits are larger than an
inch in diameter, it doesn't matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: many bacteria you paint on with that
paintbrush, they do not get symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, in terms of the fruit,
the symptoms are, the disease can only,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, the pathogen can only affect when
the fruit are young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, sort of wrapping up my
bacterial diseases, they're much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true of most, but not all
plant diseases are going to be much worse
[SPEAKER_00]: in wet summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know our bacteria survive both in
greenhouses and they can survive on farm
[SPEAKER_00]: over winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can arrive on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very limited options for
bacterial diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things my group does every
year is test potential new options for
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say maybe 10 years ago,
I was really excited because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: company that was producing tiny viruses
called bacteriophage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those bacteriophage, are super
specific to one particular bacterium and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a virus that goes in and only
kills the bacterial canker pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried it, but it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, a different company had a
new product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still feel like there's a lot of
promise in this biological control
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the one we tried last year worked
better than nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good, but it did not work as
well as the copper that we put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So copper is the most commonly used
control strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacterial, in terms of timing,
bacterial pathogens can arrive any time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season, but it is one of the diseases
that you can see early in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if it came through
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab has tested bacteria for copper
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is known copper resistance in almost
every bacterial pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw some in the bacterial spot
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial spot, because it loves that
warm, humid weather, is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor for tomato production in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that some transplants came up
that had bacterial spot with some copper
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, but we really haven't seen
widespread copper resistance here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that in some instances,
there can be too much copper put onto a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the copper was not
phytotoxic, but you can see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic is just blue with copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grower was worried about rain and
did not have a history of bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and was spraying copper on a
five-day schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do have bacterial pathogens,
they can be devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And control strategies can be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are questions on bacterial
pathogens, otherwise we will have a poll
[SPEAKER_00]: on early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you see early blight on your
farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne, Abby, Amara, did I miss anything
in bacteria while people are answering the
poll?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, it's Abby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that at one point you were
doing, I don't know, maybe it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: was it black rot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you did this in tomatoes,
but you had a way to know whether the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria was being brought in on seed more
frequently than overwintering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you have a sense of
that with the tomato bacterial diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do for bacterial canker,
the bacterium that causes bacterial speck,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all seem to be extremely,
it's really hard to differentiate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial canker, we do know that it's
about a 50-50 mix of the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: overwintering on-farm and new strains
coming in each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for bacterial spot, I have a student
that's working on that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have quite enough, we don't have
quite enough isolates of the pathogen yet
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone sees it some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my plots and in my home garden,
I seem to see it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trademark symptom of early blight
is this target-shaped lesion on the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early blight also goes to the tomato
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say it looks like a target
on the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bit of a harder time always
seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the leaves, you get these very
characteristic target-shaped lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When early blight is young, it's really
hard to differentiate from other
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will show you an example of that in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see early symptoms,
there are small dark lesions, which there
[SPEAKER_00]: are several other pathogens that also
cause small dark lesions, including
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial speck and septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older leaves have these, older lesions
are target-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early blight, the fungus that causes
this disease, the fungus has a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool name, Alternaria tomatophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It survives in the soil and it will,
you'll first see it on the lower leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll splash up from the soil onto
those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotation is key because the pathogen is
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can rotate out of tomato and this,
this particular pathogen can go to potato
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a super closely related
pathogen that, and they can both sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: go to potato and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to rotate away
from potato and tomato and they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be worse in wet weather because well,
pathogens like wet weather, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: you're likely to get that splashing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, to rotation, anything you
can do, if you have a weed cloth or a
[SPEAKER_00]: straw mulch or something on the ground to
try to prevent splashing from the soil up
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the plant, that's really going to
help you control early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are young early blight region,
early blight lesions, small dots on a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look remarkably similar to these
septoria lesions and these bacterial speck
[SPEAKER_00]: lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone brings a leaf like this
into my lab, I can't differentiate the
[SPEAKER_00]: three when they're that small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have to isolate and see which
pathogen that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early blight, as I said, is an annual
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see lesions, as you can see in this
plant starting on the lower leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they'll move up rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that splashing up the plant from
either overhead watering or rain events
[SPEAKER_00]: that really will move it to the plant
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can take a plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And including septoria here, I'm going to
talk about management because you manage
[SPEAKER_00]: them both in a similar manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you guys seen septoria on your
farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Septoria leaf spot is these tiny spots
here, as you saw on the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The characteristic lesion that you see
over here on the right-hand side is that
[SPEAKER_00]: dark ring with a tan center and tiny black
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing else that looks like
an old septoria lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be confusing with early blight,
especially at some of the younger stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you're going to see
both septoria and early blight together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually because it's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that shows up in this poll
because a lot of times you might be seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're like, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had brown spots on my leaf, but I'm not
sure what fungus or what organism was
[SPEAKER_00]: causing these brown spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whoa, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Septoria leaf spot, as I said,
comes, it survives over winter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the early blight pathogen
splashes up onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, again, those characteristic
lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tan spots starting to
develop in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's confused with other spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that's tricky about it
is that it's seen mid to late season,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the time when you're going to see
almost all of the tomato pathogens showing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can make it tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tricky as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much like early blight, it thrives in the
wet years as the fungus splashes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was visiting a grower, and actually it
might have been with Abby, and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: one field on their farm that they took us
to because they knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I visit farms, people tend to show
me their most diseased plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular field was in a remote
area of the farm, and it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no control strategies were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire field was destroyed by the
combination of Septoria and early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in this field,
they did have a black plastic mulch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: straw mulch between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with that, the fungus was able to
move from the soil up onto the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: completely wipe out this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a total loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they tried to go in and see if
they could harvest anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, it was a total loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So managing early blight and Septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotation is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scouting is important because you're going
to want to see, oh, I have a lesion right
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you scout and see that
first lesion, if you're going to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: a control strategy, whether it's one of
the effective fungicides, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrols that I haven't tested them,
but from what I've read have mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to do that early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to scout,
oh, there's a lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is when I need to really start
focusing on disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tolerant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The varieties that most growers commonly
grow, because that's what the market
[SPEAKER_00]: wants, are susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are tolerant varieties
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was early blight and Septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys seen this on your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab only started working on tomato leaf
mold five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really because of the increase in
high tunnel tomato production in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: that we started working on tomato leaf
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this group, it seems that most
folks, thankfully, have not seen tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the person who sees it most years or
the people that see it most years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing that you have some high
tunnel tomato production, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see it most often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our research high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to do tomato leaf mold
experiments in our research high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could inoculate plants, which I would
never want to do on a grower farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did several different research
projects on tomato leaf mold in our high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Kelly inoculating some of our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato leaf mold is common in high tunnels
because it likes hot and humid conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and it likes cool nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what you have in a high
tunnel scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have plants in the field and it's a
rainy season, you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does not like the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't want my leaves wet, which is
unusual for a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it likes those hot, humid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually needs very high humidity
for the spores to germinate and attack the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see on the upper leaf surface,
you see these yellow spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the lower leaf surface,
you can see this brown to gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people tend to call it sort of
olive colored fuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are actually all spores of the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many spores that once it
gets started, those spores just can spread
[SPEAKER_00]: like wildfire through a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tend to see this mid to late season
because the pathogen will survive over the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter in the high tunnel on plant debris
generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a while for it to get
established and then move throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel during the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we control tomato leaf mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, it overwinters in the
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we remove debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this can be difficult for
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rotating the high tunnel out of tomato
will really help reduce the incidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato leaf mold, especially since it's
surviving in that tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one year enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you need more than one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year at least, from what I have read.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done the rotational studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one year should be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that tomato debris breaks down
fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some really big stems,
it might take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, one year is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the drawbacks is not the right
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, if you have high tunnels,
you might have three or four next to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine if it's hot out and
you roll up the sides and you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: many spores of the tomato leaf mold fungus
in one tunnel, they can spread pretty
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can spread rapidly to the one right
next door to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if all of the high tunnels are in
a line, it can be tricky to try to rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: away or keep one tunnel leaf mold free.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the places when I'm scouting a high
tunnel, if I see that there are sun-gold
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, which I am a huge fan of the
sun-gold tomato, I will go and scout those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in any given high tunnel,
the sun-gold is going to be the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets the tomato leaf mold first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, it's incredibly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did want to show a little bit of data
on our high tunnel leaf mold trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a student that recently graduated
that did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made some progress understanding
the leaf mold that we have here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tomato varieties that are grown
in high tunnels that are sold as resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to tomato leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some concern that the
resistance might be breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our studies, the four cultivars
that are targeted as resistant to tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf mold were resistant in our study as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this graph along the x-axis,
we have the tomato cultivar that we
[SPEAKER_00]: trialed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we rated at four different dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue bar is the first rating,
the orange bar, the second, the gray bar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the third, and the gold bar, the final
rating of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis, we have the percent
disease from 0% to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see by the final rating,
some of the cultivars in our high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good news was there were cultivars
that did have resistance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was tomato leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask you one more question first?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could someone plant a resistant tomato
variety instead of rotating out of
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes altogether?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your only focus is tomato leaf mold,
then yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the pathogen has been in
high tunnels in New York for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: making lots of spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have not yet seen the pathogen
mutate to overcome that host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we also know that there are other
pathogens, soil-borne pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will build up and can wipe out a
tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is good to rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially to get away from some of the
soil pathogens that you might have and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the soil insects that you might
have in that high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of along those lines,
for reasons that I am very curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: but do not yet understand, there's a
disease called white mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in tomato and pepper in high tunnels,
it seems to almost be worse in high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It survives in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really wanting to do some studies
to try to understand why it is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel environment is worse for those
particular soil-borne pathogens compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the field environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an aside, questions to be answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris, I have another question about
leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can keeping the air moving in a high
tunnel, is there any kind of air movement
[SPEAKER_01]: or humidity management techniques that can
contribute to management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be spacing of rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, one of my most interesting
memories of tomato leaf mold was I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the North Country visiting a grower and
walking through the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomato plants, this was in August,
and they're huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high tunnels by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rows were very close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was actually walking sideways to get
through the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came out of that high tunnel,
I was completely covered in tomato leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold fungus spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just sort of reminded me any time
I think about row spacing and high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to the grower and they said,
well, I really want to have as many
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes as possible because I want the
biggest harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I need my farm to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reducing those number of rows and
giving the plants a bit more space,
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning out to increase the airflow within
a plant will all help reduce not only leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, but any of the other pathogens that
you might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say five years ago,
I would lead off every single tomato talk
[SPEAKER_00]: with Laplight because it was by far and
away the biggest issue for tomato growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fearful of it and just thought,
wow, if I get Laplight, my crop is wiped
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the past five to maybe seven
years, the amount of Laplight that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in tomato in New York or even in
potato in New York has really declined to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where I am now, including this
as the last disease that I talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people see it some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have Laplight, it's definitely
going to impact your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this slide, I wanted to show a
diversity of the symptoms that we might
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a young tomato fruit, you're going to
see a lesion like this brown lesion on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You frequently don't see as many of the
pathogen spores on the younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: very green fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a brown lesion like the
picture here on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf here in the center is an image
that I frequently use because it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the characteristic image of tomato
Laplight that just millions of spores of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen that show up on the underside
of the leaf and will, they're wind-borne,
[SPEAKER_00]: fly through the air and can cause a huge
amount of disease in a relatively short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen can also attack the stem of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here on a tomato stem,
here's a leaf lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a stem lesion with so many of those
white spores on the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a ripe fruit, this is sort of
the extreme close-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you can see that the pathogen
is just really devastating that ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Laplight is caused by a water mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a fungus, but it's actually
quite evolutionarily different from a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of things that make
that really important to understand if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those is that this particular,
well, water molds in general will go
[SPEAKER_00]: completely crazy in cool, wet weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this image that I have here on the
left, at first you look and you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that's a healthy tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at it closer,
you can see that there are lesions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves of these tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably not yet, close to 5%
of that tomato plant has some,
[SPEAKER_00]: Laplight on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my lab has done quite a few studies
that once that tomato plant gets to 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, which is really not very much,
it's nearly impossible to control this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, especially if it rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're all so nervous about
Laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 5% bacterial disease,
you can still think about slowing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wow, it's really hard to slow Laplight
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lesions can grow really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so common to hear people say,
I was in the field yesterday and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today the plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can grow really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will attack, as I showed earlier,
the leaves, the fruit, and the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to that characteristic white
sporulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I would spend a second
talking about that because this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: closeup of those spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do is they're formed
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the morning, when the humidity
decreases, the sun comes out, those spores
[SPEAKER_00]: actually twist in the lower humidity and
twist their way right off the leaf into
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind of the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spread to other leaves in the
same plant, other plants in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: field, and the fields next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we need to worry about where
is that original Laplight inoculum coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the pathogen is not
very good at surviving the winter here in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, which is a really great thing
about winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills Laplight for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that it will survive the
winter here in New York is in potato
[SPEAKER_00]: tubers that are not harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a potato field got Laplight,
this pathogen goes to both tomato and
[SPEAKER_00]: potato, also petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a potato tuber that is
infected with the Laplight pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this tuber sprouts, that new sprout
will have Laplight, and it can spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanitation is so critical for this
particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to highlight, I encourage you all
to go to the website called usablight.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lots of resources on Laplight,
and you can sign up for text messages that
[SPEAKER_00]: will actually tell you if the pathogen has
been identified in our region of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, if we identify
Laplight in New York state, any of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: we push that out through social media and
all of our weekly newsletters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laplight is somewhat unique amongst plant
pathogens because it's characterized by
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you saw all of those spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those spores are all the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the pathogen overwinters in that
potato tuber and comes back the next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still the exact same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since 2011, we have had the same
strain in the state of New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its name is US-23.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some really interesting
things about this strain, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: why we have not seen Laplight as
aggressive as we had maybe five to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sensitive to the fungicides that can
be used to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more aggressive on tomato than
potato, so you're less likely to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: overwintering potato tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a nice thing about it is we've done
studies that show that copper can control
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular strain if the copper is
applied early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we have not had much
Laplight recently, we still need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really vigilant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing that I wanted to show
was that there are some tomato varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are resistant to Laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture of the variety trial that
we had, these are individual plots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants are flat out dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that there are plots where
the plants are still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really exciting because if we
know if, let's say, 2022, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible outbreak of Laplight and we think
that there will be Laplight in 2023 as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you could plant some of these
resistant tomato cultivars knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: even if there was Laplight, you would get
a tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be your favorite cultivar
that you've ever eaten in your whole life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you would get a tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genes are known that enable this
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called pH 2 and pH 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the varieties that
are resistant to Laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are ones that are now
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were really happy to see that some
tomato varieties were holding up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common strain of Laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So controlling Laplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using those resistant varieties,
scouting is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to catch that so early,
especially if it's a cool and wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use fungicides,
there are effective fungicides available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotating fungicides is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, copper has some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, if you think you have
Laplight, let one of us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a sample and we'll make sure
that it's Laplight and help with any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues you might have in controlling the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll spread quickly to other plants and
to other fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remove and destroy infected plants as
rapidly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back to the best way to control
plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your first and best defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've outlined some of the cultural
practices that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will thank the people in
my lab that did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers that led us onto their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: My CCE and IPM colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our work is funded both by the
state of New York and by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will take questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody has any questions, can you
please put them in the chat?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a quick one to get us started with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we had a question yesterday someone
was asking about when they see diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have thresholds for the different
diseases that people should be looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for?
[SPEAKER_04]: When do they need to act?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thresholds for many of the
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be listed in the vegetable
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's on your farm, if it's a bacterial
disease or early blight septoria,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say as soon as you see lesions in
the plant, that's going to be your
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's late blight, your threshold is if
it's in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hope that your farm is not the
first farm in the county to have late
[SPEAKER_00]: blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the reasons that we
really want everyone to scout and let us
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once there is a farm in the county
or a nearby county that has late blight,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be our threshold to start
thinking about the best management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any yet in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody wants to write in their
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or more than happy to unmute yourself if
you would like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can ask questions too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a question about I think this is
in relationship to high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you plant spinach in the fall after
tomatoes and harvest in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest that spinach and then plow under
and you plant again the next season,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that considered a rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you took your tomatoes out in
September, you put spinach in and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put tomatoes back in in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that considered a rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my answer would be no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need a season, a year,
a season out of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible with the tilling,
if you're really getting rid of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf debris, that you might not have a
leaf mold issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of some of the soil
pathogens, I would say stay a whole year
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40 sun-gold tomatoes in your high
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, please invite me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recommendations to avoid leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that air spacing is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most effective thing, so first air
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, scout beyond the lookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you scout it, it's actually
fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking across the high
tunnel, look for any time you see a yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yellow spots can be caused by a lot of
things, but one of them is leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you see that yellow spot,
you flip the leaf over and see if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that gray mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is that if you
are planning to use a control strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to start as soon as
you see that first lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so scouting is really, really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that making sure that you're
pruning the lower leaves, get rid of those
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abby is also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, share them with the IPM house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris, I had a question about fungicide
strategy for late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that, so mostly it's US 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so going in with methanol is probably
the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I think growers want to wait and
find out if it's US 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: But would you recommend that they just go
ahead with the methanol and whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: know or not if it's susceptible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the if the late blight is in the
field, yeah, then yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in in 11 years, the predominant
late blight we've seen has been sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: to methanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also mentioned fungicide
rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, is there like a class of
fungicides that's, you know, better in
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation with methanol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, should it be trans laminar or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about a good rotation
fungicide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think that trans laminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the those fungicides that are
effective on the OMI seats, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the Revis, the Presidios, the Arandis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to use those, you know,
on a limited basis because we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, but also because they're very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that alternating something
that's trans laminar and affordable with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something something that's more
expensive is the best strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly with this this U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23, we have seen success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but those, you know, the the ran man,
the Presidio, the Revis, the the Arandis
[SPEAKER_00]: are all very effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris, you have one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also know you have to hop off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a chance to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we biological fungicides for
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have trials every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had last year the the we had the
phage that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had double nickel and double
nickel after after copper, double nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: actually worked the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that was effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tried regalia against bacterial
diseases and we have not seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also tried oxidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried lifeguard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried a lot of different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, you know, bacteria are really
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, the double nickel,
we've seen the best sort of it not as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as copper, but in that next best category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be trying actually additional
biologicals this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually I'm hopeful that,
you know, that there is now a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists that are studying, you know,
what can really survive on that leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if we can really learn
about what survives on the leaf surface or
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we enable those biologicals to
survive on the leaf surface, I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that will really help propel
biologicals into a, you know, into a place
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can we need to find ways to help
the biological survive and outcompete that
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be going over nutrition
and fertility management for tomatoes in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I go through the talk,
I'm going to try to be pointing out how it
[SPEAKER_02]: relates to IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we go through this, feel free to put
questions in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to those questions at the end of
the session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fundamentals and nutrition is a place I
always like to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go over the plant needs,
the relationship of pH and soil fertility,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also uptake inhibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does a tomato mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pulled straight out of the
recommendations or guidelines that Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: puts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right across the top, we'll see that
it's based for soil for transplants into
[SPEAKER_02]: bare ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really I don't know anyone who
does direct seeding in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have bare ground transplants and then
we also have separate recommendations for
[SPEAKER_02]: transplants in plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they're separated out is
not because the overall tour
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the same like you see in the blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because what you do at broadcast and
disking is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: When plants are on plastic mulch,
they very often have trickle irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to spoon feed those
plants throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're broadcasting less in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right across the top, we see a range of
nutrient levels for potassium and for
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number, the largest number,
that's what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medium and high, that's adjusting that
recommendation downwards based on your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how you read these if you have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said so test, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much do you add?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: The management of your fertility should
always be based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be testing your soil at least
every three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've made some sort of change to
soil, either adding a lot of amendments or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you had the field manureed last
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if your early crop of peas came
off, you had the field manureed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you've done a lot of pH adjustment,
you want to retest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every lab will have a slightly
different extraction method.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important thing is that you're looking
at the pounds per acre or the sufficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you switch from labs to lab,
it's the numbers, the values may not line
[SPEAKER_02]: up, but the sufficiency bars will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very quickly, we can look to see that
this field is very high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's high in potassium, very high in
calcium and high in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, pretty good fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four things you should check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to those bars, you should
check out the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to give you a lot of
information about what nutrients may or
[SPEAKER_02]: may not be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to check out the percent organic
matter because that's related to so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of fertility, it's related
mostly to nitrogen cycling and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: related to the soil's ability to hold on,
store nutrients and then give them back up
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your soil test should always go in with a
name, the series name of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it goes in with a name, then the
recommendations coming out are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: better tailored to your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil name tells the lab if you have a
clay soil, a sandy soil, something in
[SPEAKER_02]: between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the bottom, the lab is giving
recommendations for what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that labs almost always
recommend 50 pounds of phosphorus for a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get into why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the phosphorus is very,
very high, lots of labs will recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: that because they're trying to overcome a
temporary deficiency caused by cold soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a management decision that,
you know, along an IPM standpoint might
[SPEAKER_02]: not always make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always want to aim to optimize
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM is just as much about prevention as it
is about sustainability.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so optimizing your pH and fertility
makes a ton of sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with this little graphic
down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very common analogy for how you
think about fertility and what's limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every stave in the barrel is a different
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along the front, they've written the macro
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along the back, they've written the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And inside you fill it up with water and
the water is your yield potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your yield in terms of nutrition is only
going to be able to go as high as your
[SPEAKER_02]: most limiting nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the water is spilling
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it's potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I particularly like this barrel because
oftentimes I think in tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: our yield and our quality is more limited
by potassium than by anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have fertility that's too low,
either your gross fertility, so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: your overall plant fertility or your
specific fertility of one nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up with plants that are stressed
in some way and stressed plants are more
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to diseases and insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insufficient levels of fertility for
specific nutrients can often interfere
[SPEAKER_02]: with fruiting and fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this idea of sufficiency also applies
to water stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to mean that, yes,
we're talking about fertility,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if your plants are constantly going
through drought, flooding cycles,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not functioning very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've created an artificial
temporary inability to get nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of pH being too low, we often
find that when the pH drops, the macro
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients become unavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're present in the soil, but the plant
can't get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the micronutrient availability in
the soil goes way up and that can cause
[SPEAKER_02]: some toxicity problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the flip side, if we're running too
much infertility, too high, very fertile
[SPEAKER_02]: soils, yes, the plants are doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you continue to put more fertilizer
into that soil, you're really wasting
[SPEAKER_02]: money, especially this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fertilizer costs were up 80 to 100% over
last year in Western New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was as of mid February.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've continued to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the year to be excessively
applying fertilizer from an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get too much of certain nutrients,
we can start seeing some uptake problems
[SPEAKER_02]: caused by other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we start to see some
inhibition and some competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: One example of this is if you are
fertilizing very heavily with a NH4 plus,
[SPEAKER_02]: so an ammonium style fertilizer,
the ammonium is in competition with
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium for uptake in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you give your plants a giant slug
of ammonium, you can cause a temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease in the availability and uptake of
potassium and a temporary insufficiency in
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, if you're feeding with nitrate,
NO3, minus format, the plant uses that
[SPEAKER_02]: much more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not competing for uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a weed scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always look at how can we control weeds
with our IPM toolbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the easiest things we can do is
not feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weeds love fertility, and they're so much
better at using it than most of our crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are hoarding it in,
especially pigweeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to collect more nutrition
than they can possibly use, and they hold
[SPEAKER_02]: it so other plants can have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also growing really big,
sowing lots of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a strong IPM tactic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much fertility can favor certain pests
and diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give examples of that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also interferes with breeding and fruit
quality and is environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at pH, as pH gets too high,
we tend to see micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the soil, but they're no longer
available to the plants, and we start to
[SPEAKER_02]: see deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really common for manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's common for zinc, and it's common for
iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the place that we see those problems
is in the transplant production stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're not actually using soil,
when we're using some sort of starter mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pH rises in those, and we start seeing
yellow in the new shoots, slow growth out,
[SPEAKER_02]: diminished leaf size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are micronutrient deficiencies in
the transplants because the pH of the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing media has gotten too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual micronutrient deficiencies in the
field are very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside, I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does happen in almost from time to time
because the pH of the soil has gotten too
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep talking about pH and nutrient
availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the chart that shows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the bottom, we've got the pH of the
soil, and each of these different color
[SPEAKER_02]: bars is a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top set up through magnesium right
about here halfway down, those are the
[SPEAKER_02]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Below that are the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see most of our tomato crops,
most recommendations say around 6.5,
[SPEAKER_02]: and at 6.5, the width of the band that's
available to the plants really matches how
[SPEAKER_02]: much that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is why we're aiming at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: It naturally balances the amount of
nutrition that the plants need against the
[SPEAKER_02]: availability of those nutrients in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have all the fertility we need,
but if the plants can't get it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always like to look at what could be
inhibiting the uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep talking about tunnels because a lot
of tomatoes end up being grown inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very common in tunnels that we get
an accumulation of salts, and they rise
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going in with manure-based
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going in with poultry-based
fertility pellets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going in with our liquid
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those rise up through the soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water evaporates, leaving the salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And salts, they change the osmotic
pressure, and they start inhibiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots' ability to pick up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing in the field, compaction
is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a giant wet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone decided, I really have to drive
through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find another way around and just
compacted the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already had drainage issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to keep on causing more
drainage issues and more uptake problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of times, fertility problems
will chase water issues or chase
[SPEAKER_02]: compaction issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things that inhibit nutrition and
fertility from an IPM standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm seeing a fertility problem and it's
not uniform, fertility problems caused by
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding are uniform across your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not uniform, then I want to check
out the roots in that area, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like a circular pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice healthy tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you haven't dug up roots of one
recently, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But things like nematodes can have a big
impact on the apparent nutrition status of
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can root rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium and verticillium are two wilts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see verticillium sometimes in high
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's oftentimes because we're seeing
different heirlooms being grown in there
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't have the genetic resistance to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Verticillium is going to darken up the
veins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we test for it by splitting the
veins.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever raised an eggplant,
you will know what verticillium does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes out half a leaf or one branch
with wilting and yellowing and then
[SPEAKER_02]: scorching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium is more of a generalized
yellowing that eventually progresses to a
[SPEAKER_02]: scorch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a wilty plant, this can be confused
sometimes for a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these will inhibit how well the
plant's functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get an appearance of a nutrient
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are we good, Marion?
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, so good.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing with optimizing is the
timing and the ratios of what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are feed me now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a generalized growth curve and
their growth curve follows the uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: curve, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, it's this S-shaped curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this lag phase when they're
little, a rapid growth phase when they
[SPEAKER_02]: have a high nutrient demand, and then
their nutrient demand levels off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say this is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these little baby transplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing, but they're not really
taking off yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get into the quick, vigorous growth
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you want to time your nitrogen
feed right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the reason why the recommendations
for tomatoes under plastic said that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to cut your fertility back
because we're planning under plastic,
[SPEAKER_02]: we often have drip in your spoon feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole purpose of spoon feeding is not
to waste your fertility down here,
[SPEAKER_02]: is to feed it when you have much more
fertilizer use efficiency and target the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in their developmental stage where
they need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you miss these growth curves,
you could be stressing your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give a lot of your nitrogen
broadcast in the field, not only are you
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding your weeds, you're also increasing
the chance that that's going to leach out
[SPEAKER_02]: with spring rains, and that translates to
stress, loss yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you miss the shift in the potassium
uptake needs, then you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: leading to poor fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so potassium has a delayed shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll switch to the other side here,
talking about balance in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomato plants, when they're young,
you want to be feeding primarily for
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_02]: For NPK, you're feeding mostly for
nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they begin flowering, you're feeding
that plant for potassium management.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a much greater physiological
need as they flower, as they set fruit and
[SPEAKER_02]: need to load sugar into those fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you miss that shift, that's where we
tend to see a lot of fruit quality issues
[SPEAKER_02]: begin to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we have problems,
particularly with determinate tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they go through their first fruiting
and their fruit very heavy, but then they
[SPEAKER_02]: really peter off throughout the season and
struggle to keep those plants going
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ways you want to balance,
you want to make sure that you match the
[SPEAKER_02]: macros and micros are balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get deficiencies in both micro and
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: In macronutrients, we're very prone to
getting toxicities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants do not need much at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants need like a pound to the acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try and feed boron to your plants,
it's extremely easy to poison them
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally by giving them too much where
it goes toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that reason, micronutrients,
we try to manage with pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: We optimize pH to manage our
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't correct that with pH,
then you would foliar feed something like
[SPEAKER_02]: a chelate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chelates are designed to be safe for
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very low application rates,
and they're also designed to move into the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a time when foliar feeding
makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: When foliar feeding does not make sense,
it's when you're trying to feed a
[SPEAKER_02]: macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are designed to take up nutrients
through their roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves are designed to keep things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you foliar feed a macronutrient,
you often get a very quick, rapid,
[SPEAKER_02]: satisfying green-up effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is temporary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you have to foliar feed every
week, every couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That green-up doesn't last.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we look at the tissue testing,
when we look at the research on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: we find that foliar feeding is actually
much more inefficient in terms of what the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant can take into itself and
incorporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Marion.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was going to say you did get one
question, if you want me to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you only feed through drip and not
broadcast any fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can absolutely broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can absolutely broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, people who are broadcasting,
they're open field tomatoes, so they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not on plastic, or they're broadcasting
before they form up their beds,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was about not broadcasting
and only foliar feeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only foliar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only foliar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only drip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you only feed through drip and not
broadcast any fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most growers will start off still
broadcasting a little bit, as they learn
[SPEAKER_02]: to manage the nutrition only through drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've never done heavy management
of nutrition through drip, maybe broadcast
[SPEAKER_02]: some a little bit to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who have been raising in tunnels or
greenhouses for a long time, both tunnels,
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't broadcast that much at all,
if any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that depend, Elizabeth, on whether
you had sufficient nutrients like that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test that you showed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were sufficient for a lot of
nutrients, so it seemed as though that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good field to possibly not
broadcast in but use the drip more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, and that actually was a test
from a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in part why the pH was so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things that this farm
was doing was they had been adding a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of animal-based compost year after year
after year, and all that dairy manure
[SPEAKER_02]: drove the pH way up, and their fertility
levels way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they had so much excessive
calcium, and they had so much excessive
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus, higher salt levels,
and they had really high pH as a result of
[SPEAKER_02]: all that composted dairy manure that went
into that tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that case, yeah, they were just
feeding through the drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomatoes are really, really well
understood in terms of their fertility and
[SPEAKER_02]: their tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue testing is a great tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that growers who are
struggling with their fertility tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: test at least twice a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time you want a tissue test
is about four weeks after transplanting,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the second time you tissue test is
when your first fruit are tiny,
[SPEAKER_02]: like not quite golf ball sized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those two tissue tests give you two
very important life stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three to four weeks after
transplanting is when that plant is about
[SPEAKER_02]: to enter its rapid vegetative growth
phase, and when the first fruit are not
[SPEAKER_02]: quite golf ball size, that's when you're
making that shift out of vegetative focus
[SPEAKER_02]: into reproductive focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you tissue test, you want to tissue
test exactly as lab tells you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes, that's taking the first fully
expanded mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tends to be about the fifth leaf down
from any tip, and you do count the little
[SPEAKER_02]: teeny tiny leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fifth or sixth leaf down, you want to
do it when the plant is, it's got great
[SPEAKER_02]: water status so that leaf snaps right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to make sure that you
rinse anything off of that leaf surface
[SPEAKER_02]: and then pat it dry before you put it in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs less than $20, including
shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at those two times, you still have the
ability to correct any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tissue testing shows you problems
before you would see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an example of a plant where you
definitely would be seeing the issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big deficiencies in nitrogen,
big deficiencies in calcium or potassium,
[SPEAKER_02]: manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that same tunnel that had the very
high pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're expecting a manganese deficiency
driven by pH, excessive levels of calcium,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we would expect from all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The copper levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens when people forget to rinse
off their leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the copper they're spraying on the
plant stays on the tissue test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do have to do a little bit of
interpretation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, yes, I forgot that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I have so much calcium or copper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to rinse it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tissue test tells you things
before you see it, particularly for
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the course of the season,
it becomes a very, very good management
[SPEAKER_02]: tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that we read this chart,
we have five different sampling dates
[SPEAKER_02]: across the bottom, starting in middle of
May to middle of June or middle of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a high tunnel from a study that
was done a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the macronutrients across the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green is the top of sufficiency range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red is the bottom of the sufficiency
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that the range shifts the
first solid bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are for the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these macronutrients,
the plant's physiological need for them is
[SPEAKER_02]: shifting as it moves into fruiting and
reproductive stage focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue are the levels of nutrition
available in that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, the tissue test is a look
backwards in time, but it is far better
[SPEAKER_02]: than waiting for the plant to color up.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time the plant colors up,
you've had so much damage that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: already lost the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue testing helps you prevent some of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw the nitrogen levels falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dipped too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grower changed their fertilizer blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started dipping down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed their fertilizer blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's useful over the course of season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just re-emphasizing that point,
if you don't rinse the leaves off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see really big spikes in copper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just you sprayed copper and
forgot to rinse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So foliar testing is a great tool for
nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quick, I'm going to go through
recognizing deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do this quick because there
are so many good foes on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This panel I have right here is kind of
like, it's old, it's dated, but it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: classic panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very easy to recognize these foes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have that kind of fridge magnet
style look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're on the internet, you're like,
eh, is this really that deficiency?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it against these fridge magnet
types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nitrogens and mobile nutrient,
when it's deficient, it's the lower
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant life's bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weak plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very common for us to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: More in tomatoes, we see excessive
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you get this very dark,
bushy, lush, beautiful plant that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, that doesn't set fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've got all this bushy plant,
because we tend to trellis our tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that material gets packed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets wounded when it gets packed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have good airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see a much higher incidence of
botrytis when we have excessive nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So managing nitrogen is actually an IPM
tactic for botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also tends to reduce the attractiveness
of your tomatoes to aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM tactic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is botrytis directly attacking
foliage, but it also leaves these ghost
[SPEAKER_02]: spots on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've ever had fruit where it
starts this softer rot off the blossom
[SPEAKER_02]: end, that's botrytis getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botrytis will hit the tomatoes at the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then wait until the tomatoes mature to
rot it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it goes directly after the foliage,
it's very hard to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can lose tomato crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen many tunnels go down to
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium is a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that you really want to
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important physiologically for
loading sugar into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't have the sugar getting into
the phloem to distribute around the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're not going to be growing very
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you're looking for scrawny tips
to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking for flower abortion,
like we see in this photo here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're starting to see yellow shoulders
develop on the fruit that are maturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In really severe cases, you'll get a
purpling across the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole plant is suffering, and you can
start to see other secondary nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium is the one that you're watching
with the tissue test more than anything
[SPEAKER_02]: else, because it's more of an invisible
deficiency by the time you start seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: the signs of it, you've already lost yield
potential, and you've definitely lost
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really poor flavor, yellow shoulders,
that's usually potassium, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: a magnesium thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your flavor is not where you want to
be, try adjusting your potassium
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphorus is very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that available in cold soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember earlier I said that most labs
will recommend a little bit of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if the levels are just out of the sky
eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because cold soils, phosphorus is in
it, but the plants can't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is because there's a fungal
intermediary that helps to collect a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: When soils are cold, the fungus is not all
that active.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that it's very common,
and it's a temporary thing that we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: transplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a reddening or purpling on the
underside of the leaf, so you flip that
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf over and all the veins are coloring
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can most easily resist and resolve this
by using a little bit of phosphorus in the
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant water, or by using a raised bed
plastic mulch to get it warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, phosphorus is really important for
root growth, so that's why they're
[SPEAKER_02]: recommending it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the soils are cold, but we also need
to really quickly establish roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: so feed the phosphorus early.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we go through the summer, their need
goes way down, and particularly in tunnels
[SPEAKER_02]: where phosphorus tends to build way up,
or in organic farms where you're using a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of animal-based inputs, phosphorus
levels get quite high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull the phosphorus completely out
of your summer drip program.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil will supply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a soil that is very low in pH,
or you have soils that are naturally very
[SPEAKER_02]: high in aluminum, a lot of shinangos are
very nice agricultural soils, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally very high in aluminum,
know that phosphorus is inhibited by
[SPEAKER_02]: excessive levels of aluminum in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those cases, when you have very high
aluminum, you do want to feed phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: through the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphorus is loaded into the leaves
first, so you may see that color hang on
[SPEAKER_02]: the old leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're checking the new growth for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnesium, another macronutrient,
very, very common to see some deficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mobile nutrient, so the plants will
reallocate from low in the plant up to
[SPEAKER_02]: high in the plant when they're a little
bit deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interveinal yellowing, so it's
spotting between the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: With age, you can see here, they start to
get a little bit of a bronze spot in the
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple or bronzing in the center of the
yellow in between the veins, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't something to get excited about
so long as it's in the bottom part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really wanting that to stay good in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: With magnesium, we divide the plant in
thirds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in the lower third of a
mature-sized plant, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it starts creeping up or getting more
severe and heading towards the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: third, you want to be managing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elizabeth, we're getting tight on time
just to let you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: About two minutes left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a side-by-side, this is a tunnel that
had a lot of fertility problems not caused
[SPEAKER_02]: by lack of available nutrition in the
soil, but caused by problems like severe
[SPEAKER_02]: compaction, too much salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had other factors inhibiting their
fertility uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a severe potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it gets this bad, that's covering up
the foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to see it make other nutrient
problems even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium deficiency will color up the edges
of the leaf, and it's a fairly bright
[SPEAKER_02]: coloring up of the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium deficiency doesn't move through
the plant, so you'll see it color one age
[SPEAKER_02]: group of leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next age group of leaves won't have
it, but that age group will never get
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have that for life in that age
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're looking is for improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is magnesium as it gets more severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This blossom end rot, a lot of people will
say it's calcium, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have enough water to move the
calcium to the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium level is fine, inconsistent
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the most common nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do lead to weak plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do cause other IPM problems as you go
down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get these gross overall nutrient
deficiencies, just one final photo,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see all the disease in here,
all the decay, all the rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, some really cute birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that, we're going to end the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stop sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, please drop
them in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one that just came into the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do muck soils have an effect on tomato
fertility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Muck soil is incredibly high organic
matter soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's formed from dead plants and trees and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really old swamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, it holds so much more
nutrition per unit of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a cup of soil, it holds much
more nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it holds so much more nutrition
and because the soil naturally sits at
[SPEAKER_02]: lower pH, all of our values, if we say
tomatoes like pH 6.5 to 6.8, you adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: that down towards almost one whole unit
when you're working on muck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because the nature of the soils,
A, they run more acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: B, they can make up for it by holding so
much more fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are testing a muck, it's going to
show low.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be freaked out by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have to watch some of your
micronutrients a little more closely
[SPEAKER_02]: because some mucks don't have a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on where you are in the state,
if you may have a muck that's underlaid by
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of calcium and that will change your
fertility management.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't have the calcium underlay,
you tend to be very high in sulfur and you
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement calcium there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
