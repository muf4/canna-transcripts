[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so this is a campaign stop for me
trying to get your vote to renew my joint
[SPEAKER_03]: appointment in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of you plant breeding faculty vote
early and often because when we vote,
[SPEAKER_03]: we win.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm going to really give two
seminars in one today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are both chapters from George
Stack's dissertation, which he completed
[SPEAKER_03]: last year, and also a lot of work on the
powdery mildew project from Ali Kala,
[SPEAKER_03]: a PhD student in Chris Smart's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I will go ahead and recognize my
collaborators here because many of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them are in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stephen Snyder, you're going to see
some beautiful SEM that he did in Joss
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have collaborated with Jenny Moore's lab
for quite a while now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we were fortunate to have to be
able to work with Ping Wong and entomology
[SPEAKER_03]: in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see those data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was on sabbatical at Colorado State
for a year and got to know John McKay very
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was very generous to share a
segregating population with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the heart of the second half of my
talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got cannabinoids from Nick
Jackowitz at Serona Labs, a startup
[SPEAKER_03]: company that was based in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk about hemp today,
one of the five crops that we breed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hemp is a very interesting crop
because it has multiple market classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a 1937 Popular Mechanics article
that came out saying that hemp would
[SPEAKER_03]: become a billion dollar industry that
Henry Ford built a car entirely made of
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and that we can make 25,000 products
out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably true, but not all of
those products are viable in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace or competitive for price in
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hemp is an emerging crop because it was
only truly legalized by the 2018 Farm
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to that, it was considered a
schedule one narcotic, like heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We initially had to have a DEA
registration to be able to schedule one
[SPEAKER_03]: DEA registration just to handle the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's totally legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you work on hemp, you better like
roller coasters because it has been a
[SPEAKER_03]: serious roller coaster through the CBD
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is our top market grown either in
controlled environments settings or in
[SPEAKER_03]: high intensity horticultural settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, all of the interest is in
fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we say fiber, we really mean
either the long, strong, fast fibers on
[SPEAKER_03]: the outside of the stem or the inner woody
herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two different product streams
leading to two different markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to see a real uptick in
grain because the FDA recently approved
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of hemp seed meal as an animal
feed ingredient for laying hens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is going to stimulate the grain
market over the coming year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, this bottom machine is
actually a dual purpose harvester that can
[SPEAKER_03]: combine the grain from very tall hemp
plants while also harvesting the stems for
[SPEAKER_03]: fiber products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a diverse crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are cultivars that are bred for each
of these different market classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still in New York, we only have less
than 200 acres of hemp being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew 35 acres on our farm plots in
Geneva this year, and that was about a
[SPEAKER_03]: third of the acreage in New York state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a very early emerging crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for the farm bill,
the new farm bill, which hopefully will
[SPEAKER_03]: further relieve some of the regulatory
burden on farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that is based on THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC in many people's eyes is viewed as a
very bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the goals in our breeding
program is to breed for low or no THC to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to basically eliminate that risk for
growers, no matter what the regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think there is a market for the protein
and grain, whether it's for animal feed or
[SPEAKER_03]: for human food.
[SPEAKER_03]: For human food, we're looking at the
functional properties of the seed storage
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, it's all about fiber,
mainly for building materials and
[SPEAKER_03]: technical products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to separate that fast from
the herd, that is a process called
[SPEAKER_03]: decortication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to have varieties that are
easy and efficient to decorticate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And separate that long fiber from the
herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp has been notoriously difficult to
establish in direct seeded plantings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germination is typically rarely over 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are very few herbicides that are
registered for hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So early seedling establishment and early
seedling vigor is a major trait right now
[SPEAKER_03]: to ensure farmer success.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a part of that, one of my students
here, Luis Monserrate, is particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in breeding for large seed
size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our large seeded cultivars seem to
help to solve that early establishment
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other issue we've had is that all
of the current hemp cultivars have been
[SPEAKER_03]: bred in Europe, pretty much, or Canada,
and are not well adapted to southern
[SPEAKER_03]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been bringing in material from
tropical and subtropical China,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will address that issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all of that material tested hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are our challenges in hemp
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started from scratch in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do we get germplasm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, we have the USDA ARS Hemp
Germplasm Repository in Geneva at Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Agrotech.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Zach Stancil, the curator there,
has done a fantastic job of very rapidly
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulating a large assembly of
germplasm, both working with foreign
[SPEAKER_03]: repositories and bringing that material to
the US, but also working with folks to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect feral hemp from across North
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a lot of work to better
understand the genetics of THC production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a lot to develop genetic
mapping resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to talk about that too much
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our main focus right now is
understanding the genes involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, maybe that's for the next talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I am going to talk about today is
pest and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start out with powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a project that we did jointly
between my lab and Chris Smart's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powdery mildew is caused by the fungus
Bolivinomyces ambrosiae.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some beautiful pictures here
from Bill Weldon and David Godori's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a big problem in controlled
environment production of hemp and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in our climate in New York,
we also see quite a bit of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: in CBD hemp grown in, again, in this
intensive horticultural setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right from the outset in 2017,
when we started growing hemp, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: better understand the traits of the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that with air quotes,
cultivars that were available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were very proactive at trying to
reach out to everyone who had seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: put those into small plot trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, it was all about CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are pictures of our 2019 trials
with 30 cultivars, one in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_03]: one at Bluegrass Lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were a lot of work, a lot of
cannabinoid analysis that Stephen did in
[SPEAKER_03]: Joss's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you learn things by looking at all of
this variety of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that we consistently saw was
essentially zero ratings for powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this variety FL58.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a graph of percent disease from
ratings that were done by Ali Kala from
[SPEAKER_03]: those trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see, we were getting pretty good
levels of powdery mildew in some
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, consistently, this cultivar
FL58 was resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you look at the resistance
mechanisms for powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_03]: we see either R gene based resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a paper published in 2021,
describing the first R gene from cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa, they called it PM1.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would expect this to be a dominant and
race specific mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know anything about the races of
powdery mildew, hemp powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's still an open book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna say this has been an
extremely frustrating situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this gene was discovered in a high
THC variety by a company called Dewey
[SPEAKER_03]: Scientific, a spinoff from Washington
State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Lang started that company together
with one of his students, you may know
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have refused to send that
material to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim that they've bred it into a
hemp variety, so it should be compliant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but even still, they will not send it to
us to look at and to compare with the
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance that we have in our hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been extremely frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna continue calling him out for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think it's right that they
should publish this in a peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_03]: paper and then not share the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other mechanism we can look at is a
susceptibility gene mediated mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This should have broader spectrum
resistance and would typically be
[SPEAKER_03]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a nice paper published in
2021 by Pepin et al, describing the MLO
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew locus O gene family in cannabis
sativa with two strong genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: As candidates for powdery mildew
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have here some frameworks for what
we might expect in terms of mechanism of
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew resistance in that FL58
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took that FL58 and crossed it with a
susceptible line, one of our favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties called TJCBD, pretty
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then looked at the F1 and the F1 had
variable levels of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only looked at a small handful,
but again, these are now AUDPC area under
[SPEAKER_03]: the disease progress curve graphs on the
left from a misdrew inoculation that Ali
[SPEAKER_03]: did, and on the right from a field trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you can see FL58 resistant in the
field trial and a range of
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptibilities across the F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that immediately sort of rules out that
dominant R gene hypothesis pretty much,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, because we are seeing a range of
susceptibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked two of those F1 individuals and
self them and hemp is dioecious,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can trick a female plant to make
pollen, allowing you to self pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And generated two segregating F2
populations, both with about three,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more than 300, 350 individuals
and planted those out in a field trial in
[SPEAKER_03]: Geneva in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ali again, very rigorously surveyed
this population to generate these very
[SPEAKER_03]: nice AUDPC curves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have shown the two different F2
populations here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In different graphs where we see that 25%
of the F2 are scored as resistant,
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially zero AUDPC aligned with the
FL58 parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: TJs is again, moderately susceptible,
but across the other 75% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: population, we see a range of
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that does fit this model of a single
gene recessive susceptibility gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we genotyped those 700-ish F2
individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used an Illumina array that was
developed by Phylos Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there were 55,000 SNPs,
we only had 2,700 that were useful for
[SPEAKER_03]: George to build the linkage map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say these two individuals,
we have now sequenced these and have high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality phased genome assemblies of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: FL58 is highly inbred and very homozygous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And TJ CBD looks like it is a true F1
hybrid cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were interesting choices in terms
of the genomics and George has a
[SPEAKER_03]: manuscript we're about to submit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That describes some of the interesting
comparative genomics that we're working on
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the Phylos array worked pretty
well for us, spread across the genome,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it was designed to hide THC
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he did the QTL mapping,
we saw a very highly significant single
[SPEAKER_03]: peak on chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other smaller minor peaks on
chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's chromosomes two, four, eight,
and nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at that peak, again,
we had pretty tight and strong support for
[SPEAKER_03]: that interval.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at the genotypes and
line them up with the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_03]: it does point to a recessive mechanism for
a lack of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: While among the other, the heterozygous
and homozygous susceptible allele,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is quite a range of AUDBCs across
the rest of that material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a pretty strong effect of this locus on
chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lo and behold, within that or very
close to that confidence interval is this
[SPEAKER_03]: clade five CSML01 gene that was predicted
by the Pepin paper as being a good
[SPEAKER_03]: candidate for susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very close to our peak marker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mentioned we sequenced those two
parents, FL58 and TJCBD, did pack
[SPEAKER_03]: biosequencing and OmniC to get a nice
phased assembly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, lo and behold, in the resistant
FL58 cultivar, there is a large insertion
[SPEAKER_03]: in that ML01 gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 6.8 kb.
[SPEAKER_03]: A portion of it looks like a transposable
element.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that insertion does result in a
different differentially spliced
[SPEAKER_03]: transcript, which would have a premature
stop codon and disrupt function of that
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptibility protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing, we were pretty
concerned about this early on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll show you in the next slide how we
resolve this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we started doing RT-PCR of this gene,
we were also detecting a full length open
[SPEAKER_03]: reading frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that caused us some concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can this cultivar be resistant if it's
producing functional susceptibility
[SPEAKER_03]: protein?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we spent quite a bit of time working on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did RT-PCR from both un-inoculated and
inoculated plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the open bar versus the hatch
bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I want you to focus on the
green bars, which is the proportion of
[SPEAKER_03]: transcript that has the premature stop
codon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the disrupted transcript.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we looked at FL58, yes,
we can detect a very small amount of that
[SPEAKER_03]: full length transcript.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the vast majority of transcript that's
being produced is the defective,
[SPEAKER_03]: the interrupted version of the gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you on the next slide,
we've developed some markers to detect
[SPEAKER_03]: that insertion in the ML01 gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those markers pointed us to some other
germplasm that we had, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see again in a heterozygote
for that insertion, we're seeing about
[SPEAKER_03]: half of the full length transcript and
about half of the transcript with the
[SPEAKER_03]: insertion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least in this line, we do see an up
regulation upon inoculation of the
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of that ML01 gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have a few good markers linked
to that ML01 allele that has the
[SPEAKER_03]: insertion, which is effectively a knockout
of the susceptibility gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can now use those markers to intergress
that locus into other elite germplasms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to use pace markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a couple of different pace
markers as well as gel based markers where
[SPEAKER_03]: we can clearly see the segregation of that
insertion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a very nice story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all wrapped up into a very nice
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a chapter in George's dissertation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step, we do want to do additional
more detailed RNA-seq to look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of that ML01 gene and the other
clade five ML01 MLO gene, which is MLO4.
[SPEAKER_03]: My student Lou Van Yalle will,
is working on all of these follow-up
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very interested to see if it will
confer resistance in other genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: backgrounds and whether that ML01 knockout
confers any debilitated phenotype because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's often the case with these
susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not seen that so far with FL58.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also very interested in the
resistance mechanisms between hot powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew and hemp powdery mildew and whether
we have resistance genes to those
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives to alternate pathogens,
resistance to hot powdery mildew and hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: or resistance to hemp powdery mildew and
hop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that Lou was working
on as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she has been intergressing it into
other backgrounds and making crosses to
[SPEAKER_03]: get it into the homozygous state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have also been working with the
USDA germplasm repository to screen other
[SPEAKER_03]: material and search for other sources of
powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we will find that PM1 gene in other
genotypes and won't have to go back to
[SPEAKER_03]: Dewey Scientific to beg them again for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pause here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions about the powdery mildew
story before I move on to herbivores?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, a benefit of doing all of these
small plot variety trials, it was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the butt getting the seed
from all these compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doing all the phenotyping is yet you
do learn interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, in 2019, we planted out all of
these grain and fiber varieties in small
[SPEAKER_03]: plot trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the observation that George made was
that some of them were really getting
[SPEAKER_03]: hammered primarily by Japanese beetle,
which is a pest that we have a lot of that
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't have a lot of in some other big
hemp growing regions like Colorado and
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really preferred these four varieties
shaded in blue, which happened to all come
[SPEAKER_03]: from the breeding program in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other feature of those four is
that they are all cannabinoid free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a pretty strong correlation that
the four cannabinoid free lines just get
[SPEAKER_03]: hammered by leaf feeding beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas pretty much everything else that's
making it in cannabinoids has at best a
[SPEAKER_03]: low level of herbivory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are reports in the literature that
cannabinoids may have some effects on
[SPEAKER_03]: arthropod health and feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think we had some good
hypotheses that we could test to see what
[SPEAKER_03]: the role is of cannabinoids on at least
this type of leaf feeding herbivore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to give you a short background
on cannabinoid biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a hemp or cannabis scientist,
this is a lot of what we all think about
[SPEAKER_03]: is cannabinoids on the medicinal side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here, we're looking at these on the
field crop side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a very simple diagram of the
biosynthetic pathway, combined GPP and
[SPEAKER_03]: olivatolic acid to make what they call the
mother of all cannabinoids, CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then depending on which synthase
enzyme is present in those trichomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will either use that CBG as a
substrate to make CBD, or if you have THCA
[SPEAKER_03]: synthase, you can convert that CBG into
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, depending on the combination or
the expression of those two enzymes,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have different cannabinoid chemotypes,
as we described them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plant lacks active CBDA synthase,
it will only make THCA synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call that chemotype one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the adult use drug type.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you might have plants that are
expressing each enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have both enzymes present in
those trichomes, they will make about an
[SPEAKER_03]: equal ratio of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call that chemotype two.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still not classified as hemp in
that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is chemotype three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is not expressing any active THCA
synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only expresses active CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thus we get CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The twist here is that that CBD synthase
is promiscuous and makes a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: THC in about a 25 to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hemp does make THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do that calculation,
when you get to about a seven or 8% by dry
[SPEAKER_03]: weight CBD line, it will exceed the 0.3%
THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's no longer hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as John McKay says, hemp is a
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also find lines where both enzymes
are knocked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we see the accumulation of the
precursor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CBG dominant lines are chemotype four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we now know that those two synthase
genes, CBDA synthase and THCA synthase sit
[SPEAKER_03]: very close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very close to each other on
chromosome seven at a region that we call
[SPEAKER_03]: has been named the B locus.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not detected any recombination
between those two genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can effectively treat them as
alleles with, and they display Mendelian
[SPEAKER_03]: inheritance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have lines that, again,
either have a knockout in the THCA
[SPEAKER_03]: synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're calling that BT zero or BT null.
[SPEAKER_03]: A knockout in the CBDA synthase,
we can call that BD null.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also find lines that have the
entire region deleted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we call that the B null allele.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you can look at these different
allelic combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, typically hemp would be homozygous
for the CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be chemotype three.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it was heterozygous for the active
CBDA synthase and some knockout,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would also be chemotype three.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be homozygous for that B null
or one of those other knockouts to be
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotype four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, we can also find
knockouts in the upstream enzymes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, knockouts in all of etolic
acid synthase which totally eliminate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not making any CVG either.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is chemotype five, cannabinoid
three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is determined again by a single
locus that has been named the O locus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're homozygous for the little O
allele, you are cannabinoid three.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're heterozygous, you can make very
low levels of cannabinoid and you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: be homozygous.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the big O allele of that all of etolic
acid synthase to be truly cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: competent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So John McKay's lab, Patrick Woods in his
group generated a mapping population by
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing one of these cannabinoid free
cultivars, USO 31 from Ukraine with an
[SPEAKER_03]: Italian fiber variety, carmignola and
generated a segregating F2 population
[SPEAKER_03]: which he shared with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out that that F2 population
was very nicely segregating.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used a single F1 and self that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a true F2 population and that F1
was heterozygous at both the B and the O
[SPEAKER_03]: loci.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have very nice nine to four to three
segregation of cannabinoid competence and
[SPEAKER_03]: production of CBD versus CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me walk you through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a log scale of total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So high cannabinoid on the right and
essentially cannabinoid free on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes sense when you look at the
little O homozygotes here, the light blue
[SPEAKER_03]: down to the light yellow are all in this
cannabinoid free group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the chemotype five plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you look across this line,
the homozygous B null genotypes are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be chemotype four, they're gonna make
CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the vertical scale is the proportion of
CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those high CBG lines, the chemotype
four lines are at the top and the rest are
[SPEAKER_03]: the chemotype three CBB.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the dominant lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gave us a very nice segregating
population to look at the role of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid competence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could also compare CBD versus CBG
from this population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So George planted it out in paired field
trials, one in Geneva, one in Ithaca in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: He rated herbivory weekly, and then
generated what we call area under the
[SPEAKER_03]: herbivory progress curves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also measured foliar cannabinoids
by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steven again looked at differences in
trichome density and morphology in a
[SPEAKER_03]: subset of these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nice phenotype you like to see,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a stats expert, but you don't
really need stats when this is your
[SPEAKER_03]: result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do need stats, but I'll show you
those next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plant on the right is chemotype
five cannabinoid free, just got hammered
[SPEAKER_03]: by some leaf feeding herbivore,
probably Japanese beetle, but it could
[SPEAKER_03]: have been slugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not entirely sure of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabinoid competent CBD line on
the left, relatively little herbivory.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a graph on the scale of herbivore
damage expressed as the log AUHPC plus
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom line is that we do see a
significant difference in the area under
[SPEAKER_03]: the herbivory progress curve between the
cannabinoid free lines in this F2
[SPEAKER_03]: population versus either the CBD dominant
or CBG dominant lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was much more herbivory in Ithaca
than there was in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a local environmental effect,
but still significant difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabinoid free and cannabinoid
competent lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, here we're graphing the log of
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So high cannabinoid on the right,
low cannabinoid on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in both sites, we see a significant
negative relief in the relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: between herbivory and cannabinoid
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we didn't really know exactly who
was chewing on those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to try to counter any
criticism about that by bringing leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: inside and putting them in a no choice
bioassay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we got the help from Ping
Wong.
[SPEAKER_03]: He provided us Cabbage Looper from his
colony, and George picked out six CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: dominant wines and six cannabinoid free
lines and did three reps of feeding with
[SPEAKER_03]: one Cabbage Looper per leaf, and then
measured mortality, position on the leaf,
[SPEAKER_03]: area consumed, and final mass of that
Cabbage Looper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, they perform much better on
cannabinoid free leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Significantly more leaf area consumed of
the cannabinoid free lines, significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: greater mass of the Cabbage Looper on
cannabinoid free lines, and significantly,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is significantly greater
mortality on the CBD leaves than on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid free leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that fits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other interesting thing is that
these cannabinoid free lines, normally
[SPEAKER_03]: these Cecil glandular trichomes are the
site of cannabinoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see in the cannabinoid competent
leaves, they're very swollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This interesting observation that Stephen
made that they seem to be collapsed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid free line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also that there's a much higher density of
trichomes on the leaf, on the abaxial
[SPEAKER_03]: side, on the bottom side, than on the top
side, the abaxial side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when George looked at the position of
those Cabbage Loopers that fit,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were much more likely to be on the
abaxial side on the cannabinoid free lines
[SPEAKER_03]: than they were on the cannabinoid
competent lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's where all the CBD is on
these chemotype three leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so again, just these are whole
leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there were differences in the
toughness of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talk to entomologists,
right, they want to know what was that
[SPEAKER_03]: toughness of the leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the nitrogen content in the leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the water content?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll do artificial diet assays
then, eliminating all of those sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we worked with this company,
Serona Labs, who had a nice water-soluble
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid emulsion, incorporated it into
the insect diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And George did both an incorporation
formula and then also painted the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids on the surface of the diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the Cabbage Loopers grew much
less on the diet with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: integrated into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a significant effect on
final mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: With higher levels of CBD and CB,
well, this is not significant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but numerically different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The surface bioassay actually worked a
little bit better and gave us the ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to do a little more range of
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did see a dosage effect with only
0.01% CBD, no significant difference in
[SPEAKER_03]: percent survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go up to 0.1 significant,
significant decrease in survival,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we killed all the Cabbage Loopers with
1% CBD, and most of them with 1% CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of those data fit the story,
leading us to this conclusion that
[SPEAKER_03]: herbivory damage is related to cannabinoid
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That our Cabbage Loopers perform better,
so it wasn't just something happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't something about leaf toughness,
because we also saw the same effect with
[SPEAKER_03]: artificial diets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we came to the conclusion that
probably breeding cannabinoid-free
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars is a bad idea, not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can breed for high CBG lines,
this Chemotype 4, which produce
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially no THC, so they will be
essentially cannabinoid-free, sorry,
[SPEAKER_03]: THC-free, but not cannabinoid-free,
and should still be able to defend
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves against herbivores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing a picture of a corn earworm,
because corn earworm goes right for the
[SPEAKER_03]: high CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hypothesis there is that corn
earworm don't care about CBD, because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where we find them in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis aphid is very abundant in the
top parts of the CBD flower at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not gonna say that this is a silver
bullet for all insect problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it does seem to have some effect on
those leaf-feeding herbivores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to thank the very generous funding
we've gotten from New York State,
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily through Ag and Markets,
but also through Office of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Management and Empire State Development.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had grants from industry,
and this project on powdery mildew was
[SPEAKER_03]: funded by FFAR in cooperation with SCOTS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And please email me, or check out our
website if you have any other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would be happy to take questions now.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 10 minutes for Larry to see how we
are gonna vote as a faculty.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question from a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering about the estrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's trade-offs involved to knock that
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that is often by knocking out the
susceptibility gene, you see an impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: vigor in other systems, and we have not
seen that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really know what the function of
those S-gene proteins is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's still an open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so there are some very mature hemp
industries in Europe and in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we in the US are only just
beginning to learn how those mature
[SPEAKER_03]: industries are performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just at a conference where I heard a
talk from the president of the largest
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp company in the world in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they grow hemp in a very specific way
and harvest it and process it in a very
[SPEAKER_03]: specific way to get textile grade fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't go to seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, they're not gonna get textile grade
fiber and grain from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't get any herd either,
because they're harvesting before the
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulation of any herd.
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, there is a mature grain
industry in Canada, in Manitoba,
[SPEAKER_03]: Alberta, Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have never collected any of the
straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their crop grows about four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: They combine it with their big,
huge, wide combines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are the largest producer of hemp
grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could buy it in the store from
Manitoba Harvest called Hemp Arts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are two mature hemp industries
that are single purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether we can develop multi-purpose
crops that are profitable and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: meet the needs of the end users,
we do the economic modeling of that and it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I understand right now is that
the end users are not gonna want those
[SPEAKER_03]: products from dual purpose crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I tried this in parts and visited
you the other time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get three in a mega six fatty
acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chickens love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so sorry, I should be repeating the
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, there are only about
200 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the exact numbers of how many
acres of cannabis there are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna guess somewhere probably around
three or 400 acres of outdoor grown
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is our outreach strategy?
[SPEAKER_03]: My outreach strategy is to provide
knowledge to growers and allow them to
[SPEAKER_03]: make the choice of whether they want to
grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be a market first and we do
not have any hemp processors in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: In New York State, again, I have a
decorticator and I am the only one in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northeast with a hemp decorticator.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need some investment in hemp
processing before I would ever suggest a
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp farmer to plant the hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think now we have delivered field
days every year since 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best attended one had about 260 people
this year, we had about 150 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is definitely interest and we
show people how to grow hemp effectively
[SPEAKER_03]: for fiber grain and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need the processing infrastructure
and we need less regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we had a lot of CBD hemp growers
in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew about 2000 or 2500 acres of CBD
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market crashed, but then New York
State, this was the only state in the
[SPEAKER_03]: country that did this, authorized our
experienced hemp growers to then get a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis growers license.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everywhere else in the country,
you cannot have both licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't grow hemp and cannabis on the
same farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So New York was pretty unique in saying,
okay, hemp growers, you can now start
[SPEAKER_03]: growing cannabis, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of my clientele then started
growing cannabis pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are not allowed to provide
extension to still schedule one drug
[SPEAKER_03]: producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do oversee not the licensing,
but the product side of CBD and sales of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the question is for me to
describe the roller coaster of the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so again, people started being able
to grow hemp after the 2014 Farm Bill and
[SPEAKER_03]: states had to pass their pilot program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every state was different, but it really
was the 2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some early states, Kentucky,
Colorado, Oregon got started ahead of
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got started, our plan was passed in
late 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started planting grain and fiber hemp
initially, but then in 2018, it became
[SPEAKER_03]: clear that CBD was gonna be the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 2019, after the 2018 Farm Bill passed,
people went berserk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the best seed producer for CBD
hemp was a company in Oregon called Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And estimates I've heard is that they sold
300 million seeds in 2019 at a dollar a
[SPEAKER_03]: piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you're in the right business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the owner, Seth Crawford, Oregon CBD,
he's a very clever guy, very
[SPEAKER_03]: scientifically oriented.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a member of the FFAR Hemp Research
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_03]: He bought PacBioSequencer and started
sequencing genomes, working with Kelly
[SPEAKER_03]: Vining at Oregon State and Todd Michael at
Salk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have now leveraged that,
all of those data into a pan genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we now have 75 based genomes from that
era, thanks to the estimated $300 million
[SPEAKER_03]: that he made in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were paying, if you're planting
2,500 plants an acre, you're paying $2,500
[SPEAKER_03]: just for the seed per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people were planting 40 acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 60,000 acres in the state of
Oregon in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on all that overproduction,
processors, we went and visited
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlotte's Web, a company in Colorado,
when we were on sabbatical, they were
[SPEAKER_03]: still processing hemp that was grown in
2019 in 2023.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're being told is that the
processors are finally now have finally
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten through all of the backlog of
biomass from 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is now finally an uptick on the
grower side for the price of CBD hemp and
[SPEAKER_03]: people are actually planting CBD hemp
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the market is so thinned out that
really the only survivors are companies
[SPEAKER_03]: that are vertically integrated,
that have a solid seed supplier,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow their own hemp, process it and market
it under their own brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple of very good ones in New
York, Beacon's Gift near Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have so many different companies,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They have fantastic apple orchard where
the kids go and pick apples and pumpkins
[SPEAKER_03]: and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have a fantastic cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the whole family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make cider and it's an incredible
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are a survivor and a success
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very few other success stories in that
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one question on the chat from
Surya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any idea whether Spotted Lanternfly feeds
on hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wonders if there's a similar story
as Cabbage Looper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also share that same question for Hopp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Spotted Lanternfly is coming in from
the south.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is a big threat to our vineyards for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have not seen damage on Hopp and we
have not seen damage on hemp so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to wait until the populations are
bigger for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least for now it does not seem to
be a huge threat specifically to hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's thank Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
