[SPEAKER_00]: You want to create a safe, living,
learning environment for the community
[SPEAKER_00]: because the soil that we're trying to
develop is actually the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to start with healthy soil,
a healthy community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So becoming a seed to supper facilitator
is more than just gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about community development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about community education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about community empowerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Parker Palmer's book, Healing the
Heart of Democracy, The Courage to Create
[SPEAKER_00]: a Politics Worthier than Human Spirit,
he talks about these five habits of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these five habits can be used as a
road map to develop a community garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to create a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community members have to understand that
the community garden is about everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the success of the garden is about
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we're all in the gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the community together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one person sticks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to stick together in order to
create our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's an appreciation of the
value of everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody comes into a community
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's story is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's food choice is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to address this and understand
and appreciate that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, with diversity comes
tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third habit of the heart is an
ability to hold tension in life-giving
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tension can arise, but there's a way to
use that tension and create a community
[SPEAKER_00]: through tension and actually recycle the
tension and devote that tension to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually developing a community garden,
developing community education efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: around the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the fourth habit of the heart is
a sense of personal voice and agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we honor life, when we honor people's
agencies, when we honor their voices and
[SPEAKER_00]: their personal backgrounds, we create
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are going into
communities that they're not used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of being self-reflexive has to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to come up against
things that you're not used to and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be sensitive to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to the fifth habit of the
heart, which is the capacity to create
[SPEAKER_00]: community, which is when we honor life,
when we honor people's agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we honor their voices and their
personal backgrounds, we create community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But creating community is not a one-time
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a continuous process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process of recreating and
rethinking and reimagining what a
[SPEAKER_00]: community is.
Thank you.
