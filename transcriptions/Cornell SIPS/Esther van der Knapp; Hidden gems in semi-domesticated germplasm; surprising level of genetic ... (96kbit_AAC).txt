[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really nice to be back in
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because all the work that I'm going to
tell you today started like one floor up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in this corner, in Steve's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yiping and I were postdocs there
around the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to have met with some of
you already this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting others this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a great time with the graduate
students over lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a nice visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off this to thank,
actually, the team that we've assembled
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last, well, started in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funded by a planned genome grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a number of co-PI's on this
project, including a group in Valencia in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain that provided the germplasm that I'm
going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in Massachusetts with Anna Casedo,
who did a lot of the evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, together with Hamid Razifard,
who was a postdoc here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's here, but I think he's
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he followed up after Anna's lab and
being postdoc in Margaret Frank's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we always work with Lucas and
Nama here at Cornell or at Boys Thompson
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute on depositing all our research
at the Sol Genomics Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always worked with Faye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a really productive
collaboration with Faye and Ying Wang at
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi State, although he just
recently moved to University of Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: where a paper that we published last year
on the evolution of small RNAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-coding RNAs in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the evolution of populations of small
RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked for many years with Sophia
Visa at the College of Wooster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was for 14 years while I
was at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's always been my outreach
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she still is on current project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the work that I'll present
today was actually done by her group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, of course,
at the University of Florida, I
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate extensively with Denise
Stieman and Harry Cleese lab, in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular with Elizabeth Frick,
who worked on volatile analysis on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my lab at the University of
Georgia, I worked on the morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: initially on fruit size, particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, Alexis Ramos,
there's a picture of him in the right hand
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, an outstanding master's student
who did all the initial hard work on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research I'm going to talk about today
was done by Elizabeth Frick or Libby
[SPEAKER_00]: Frick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two people in my lab,
Lara Perera, a postdoc who recently went
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Europe and a graduate student,
Manoj Subkota, whose work I'm actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to present today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is about to graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I wish he never graduates because
he's too valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the hidden gem part about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this varitome collection, I kind of
hinted to about that already, about the
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it the varitome collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of a number of fully wild
species accessions, the Solanum
[SPEAKER_00]: pimpinellifolia, about 20 accessions,
so it's not extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the biggest part of this
collection is comprised of Solanum
[SPEAKER_00]: lycopersicum saraciformi, or SLC,
which accessions, they range in fruit size
[SPEAKER_00]: from fruits that are as small as
pimpinellifolia to as large as fully
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have approximately 120 accessions
of SLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few very ancestral SLL fully
cultivated types that were collected in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, by the way, by the group in
Valencia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can do, this is work done by
Hamid, what you can do is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the relationship among these
subpopulations based on whole genome
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there's a phylogenetic tree
here, which I don't want you to get too
[SPEAKER_00]: much carried away, well, you cannot read
this anyway, but these are the different
[SPEAKER_00]: colors or actually different subgroups of
pimpinellifolia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the pimpinellifolia from northern
Ecuador is most closely related to the SLC
[SPEAKER_00]: from Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have here the SLC from Peru,
SLC from San Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here in this lighter orange is
SLC that are transitional from Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America moving out of Ecuador towards
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have here a cluster of SLC
from Mexico and last but not least,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fully cultivated types, the SLL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do diversity analysis on
these subpopulations, you see that what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the boxed area here is that the SLC
from Ecuador and the SLC from Peru have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much diversity as the fully wild relatives
and the pimpinellifolia from Peru and from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is obviously a great source for at
least genetic variation and hopefully also
[SPEAKER_00]: trade variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the SLL here at the
end, genetic diversity is much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very generalized, what are the
traits that we focus on during
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication, we did in the past,
which are still very important traits for
[SPEAKER_00]: crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of you know, I have worked a lot
on fruit shape and fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be this category here,
produce shape and morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today's talk is gonna be more on the
flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that Harry has given talks
here and he would present a figure like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you taste anything that you eat,
the sensory neurons on your, the sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors on your tongue, they sense the
sugars and the acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're also experiencing is the
volatiles that are released as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: eating the product, either through
directly through the nose or through your
[SPEAKER_00]: throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the focus of our research is
actually the volatile aroma that are
[SPEAKER_00]: released by ripe tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided to put a few pictures of
it in for the graduate students because
[SPEAKER_00]: all sounds really fun, but there's a lot
of hard work involved in getting the data
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm showing you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a field site in Florida,
in Northern Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an hour north of Gainesville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where Denise Thiemann grows all
their tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are collecting tomatoes and
you see they are just so overgrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sometimes are taller than some of the
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are growing incredibly wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sometimes a little bit of a chore
to find the fruits, but we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take the fruits to,
for the volatile analysis, we take the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits to Denise's lab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of pictures of from their
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there in the upper left hand corner is
Zach, who's weighing the tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorting them and weighing them and then
cutting them in smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the picture on the right,
you see Denise there and Yacine from my
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, stuffing them into glass tubes and
putting rubber stoppers on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the bottom left corner is
where they get hooked up to a system where
[SPEAKER_00]: inert air is blown over the tomatoes in
the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, it's not shown here,
but at the end of this stopper here,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a column and the volatiles are
actually accumulate on that column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after an hour of the fruits here
emitting the volatiles, we collected the
[SPEAKER_00]: columns and then we elude the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then are run on a GCMS to generate a
grammatogram like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's fairly labor intensive to do
all this volatile analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the grammatograms often are also
hand edited for accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are major volatile pathways
in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work has been done in Denise
and Harry's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a figure that's modified
from one of their reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a branch chain amino acid
derived volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's acetate ester derived volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the lipid derived volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the phenylpropanoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are the phenolics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, carotenoids
also release, you know, carotenoid derived
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles are also very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many different pathways that
contribute to the volatile aroma of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from this collection, we obtained
information about 60 different or more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 60 different volatiles and they fall
into different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was so many acetate esters
were collected, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we did is we looked at the
genetic different subgroups and quantify
[SPEAKER_00]: the different volatiles from the different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see on the panel A is
that you see that in green is the
[SPEAKER_00]: pimpinellifolium volatile profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in blue circled are the ancestral
SLL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SLC in red are either as similar as
pimpi or as similar as the SLL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very clearly what you see here,
there's a shift in volatile profile from
[SPEAKER_00]: the heirloom slash domesticated type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more modern material that's circled in
gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in panel B, you can see the
different volatile groups and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in green, there's the lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lipid derived volatiles in the SLC
from San Martin, which is a region in
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru, have very much increased over that
of the fully wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's enormous variation in volatile
accumulation in these different subgroups
[SPEAKER_00]: from fully wild to SLC to fully
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, if you have genome sequence,
we can do a genome wide association study
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it specifically with the varitome
collection because our sequences were
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work from Monosh in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used initially used just SNPs and
an older version of the tomato genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later we went back and we did the
analysis, also interrogating indels and
[SPEAKER_00]: structural variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I want to point out that
actually structural variant list was
[SPEAKER_00]: compiled by Sophia Visa, by using lumpy
and then various other ways of assessing
[SPEAKER_00]: whether this structural variants were real
or not, because you get a lot of false
[SPEAKER_00]: positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's actually our original
structural variant list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you create a Manhattan plot and
we keep it separate right now for SNPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: indels and esmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in total of 652 variants were
identified for many of the volatiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it looks like when you
plot all these variants on the genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find a part of the genome that's not
dot corresponding or not contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the volatile production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're coded here by color,
which indicates which class they're in or
[SPEAKER_00]: by circle or triangle or square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means if it's an indel snip or a
structural variant or SV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we wanted to reduce the number
of loci, because what do you do when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have 652 variants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to do that was to establish LD
and genome wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average is, we estimated that at 200
kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course there's also regions of the
central mirror where the LD would be much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger and regions in the eukaryotic part
where the LD is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we took an estimate of 200 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a snip, if there's 200 or in 150 kb
away, there's another snip, we consider
[SPEAKER_00]: that to be one locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, if you then focus only on the
eukaryotic variants, then it narrows it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to about 100 loci that collapsed
because there's either several variants in
[SPEAKER_00]: that region or the multiple variant,
sorry, multiple volatiles mapping to that
[SPEAKER_00]: same region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's still 184 loci that
display only single evidence, so one
[SPEAKER_00]: variant and one volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the meantime, we had also started to
create bi-parental mapping populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: initially primarily to map fruitway genes
and clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Denise would always look at the
parental volatile profiles and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, these are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are gonna segregate for volatile X,
Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reasonable size for an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of variants because we were
using GBS to genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did composite interval mapping
in these four populations to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of QTLs from these four bi-parental
mapping populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found that of all those QTLs
found from the composite interval mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: or the SIMP, we found that about half
actually overlap with GWAS loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I wanna mention what we're doing
now, and it's still a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there are so many loci to
select from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have nearly 300 from GWAS alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the one reason not to follow up
on the locus is if it's already cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a few genes that were
identified that are already cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not following up on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna look at novel loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took several factors into
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a hybrid of what was more
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them was evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have only one SNP that is barely
significantly associated with a volatile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's only one volatile that shows up
at that locus, then well, maybe that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: less, well, it's probably less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably important, but let's not
focus on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at evidence, meaning like,
do we get a SNP and another SNP and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: several structural variants associated
with that locus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And or are there multiple volatiles linked
to that locus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the production of, or the levels of
multiple volatiles controlled by that
[SPEAKER_00]: locus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the significance too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we get one SNP and it's
incredibly significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's only one SNP,
we're not gonna toss it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly would like to follow up on
that locus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is overlap with the mapping
population, it is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we can have other genetic
ways to confirm the locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we narrow down the number of loci we
wanna follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Manoj developed this pipeline to
make an attempt at least to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate gene identification without
going through each locus by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, 300 kb, one gene at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he did, he created a pipeline that
would interrogate the expression profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of these genes in public databases,
as well as the biochemical annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, the last part, the
biochemical annotation is where Denise
[SPEAKER_00]: always comes in and helps us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you end up with a set of loci
that have candidate genes, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also a lot that do not have candidate
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna give you an example about the
acetate ester pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two genes that were already cloned
many years ago are a carboxyl esterase on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome one and an alcohol acyl
transferase on chromosome eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the pathway there's pretty
simple as a feedback loop where the
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxyl esterase converts the esters into
alcohols and the AAT1 does the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we find CXE1 and AAT1 in our GWAS?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're indicated here on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a lot of variants
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other variants that are
underlying unknown genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have one example, for example,
where there's a lot of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see there's like a snip and an indel
and then potentially also multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles from the acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pathway because it's a lot of
dots there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that one actually shows up here
also circled in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a possible candidate gene
underlying volatile production at that
[SPEAKER_00]: locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see an example of the list of
candidate genes that we've identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: In purple highlighted in purple is a GWAS
locus that overlaps with a composite
[SPEAKER_00]: interval mapping locus or a biparental
locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one on the top, the alcohol
dehydrogenase is a really good candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now another example is the
phenopropanoid pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, there is already multiple
genes identified, five in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna talk more about the methyl
salicylate pathway in the next part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: second part of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the genes cloned are already indicated
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So salicylic acid gets converted by
salicylic acid methyl transferase into
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And methyl salicylate then gets conjugated
by glycosyl transferases into a
[SPEAKER_00]: diglucoside molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that then gets converted further to a
trisaccharide conjugate by another
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosyl transferase called NSGT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of acronyms, non-smoky
glucosyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the pathway of salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these genes are very important
in this pathway and have been cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they show up in our GWAS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, so MESS for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the gene that was recently
cloned by Libby in Harry and Denise's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why she actually focused on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a GWAS variant right on top of
the locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then NSGT1 is identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the salicylic acid methyl
transferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other two genes, there is no
variance associated with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the candidate genes for the
phenylpropanoid volatiles at the GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: loci, there's again one that is common in
both the GWAS and the biparental mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, it's annotated as a MUDYX
Hydrolase 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's known from other systems to be
involved in systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually phenylpropanoids are
part of that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a couple of other ones,
including an interesting, an E8-like gene
[SPEAKER_00]: on Gromason 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jim probably knows that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can breeders use this knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or other way to put it, like how can we
harness this genetic diversity and towards
[SPEAKER_00]: crop improvement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have to give a couple of
reminders here because the one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this research is cool to do, but how
practical is it at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need to know first, what are the
improvement alleles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can figure that out from the data
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more study and we'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to know about the
desirability of that particular volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that work has been done in
Denise and Harry's lab in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have some idea about volatiles
that are generally liked and volatiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that are generally not liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's also something about the
quantity and the combination of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles at third bullet point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to combine, you have to think
about the combination of all the volatiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that are accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so aroma is actually quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make it simple to split them up in
different paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you have a highly liked
volatile and then you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I'm gonna now select for the highest
level in my next breeding line,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it then still liked or maybe got too
much of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still ways off to use this
information for crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to realize that there are other
things coming in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last but not least, what tastes
good to some people and tomato and other
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables, it might not be
good for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody likes the same type of
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a ways off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will give you an example of how I
think we can make use of this data to some
[SPEAKER_00]: extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm coming back to methyl
salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the chemical structure and it's
produced in the phenylpropanoid pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really important pathway in
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsible for an aroma called
wintergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably doesn't sound very
appealing in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people do not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with low liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again, work done in Harry and
Denise's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is quite important for pathogen
signaling and stress signaling by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a pathway we wanna just
eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again, the biosynthesis and
conjugation of methyl salicylate I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: alluded to earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the salicylic acid methyl
transferase, the UDP glucosil transferases
[SPEAKER_00]: that converted to a disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the NSGT1 converted to a
trisaccharides and that is irreversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If NSGT1 is not present, then the
di-glucoside conjugate can be converted
[SPEAKER_00]: back to methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the methyl esterases,
the focus of this second part of the talk
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play and they can convert methyl
salicylate back to salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So methyl salicylate levels are varying in
the varitone collection, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most varieties or most accessions I should
say, these are not varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most accessions produce very low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the fully wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Produce low levels, but there are a few
accessions that produce fairly high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see in panel A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in panel B, you can see the levels of
methyl salicylate produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: different subpopulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the SP from Northern
Ecuador produces significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels than the other pimpinellifolium
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also then it produces much higher
levels than SLC from Mexico, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the SP from Northern Ecuador is
particularly producing high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl salicylate and SLC Ecuador as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I alluded to earlier, there was a major
GWAS variant, a very significant GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: variant right on the locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has also a structural variant
in here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get to the structural variant or
variant variation at the locus in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found four different genes,
MES1 through MES4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Libby did, and also with some
work done in our lab, we created a MES1
[SPEAKER_00]: knockout in the moneymaker background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Libby here shows this in the
Brennywein background.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out MES1 by CRISPR,
you get significantly higher levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're expecting if you,
let me actually go back to the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out MES1, you will start
accumulating methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's what we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knock out MES1, we get much higher
levels of methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MES1 is quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did in my lab is looking at
the haplotype diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was for us quite astonishing
because this is only based on structural
[SPEAKER_00]: variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that alone, and the basis of this was
again with the data set that Sophia Visa
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later we confirmed it with Oxford
Nanopore Sequences from Zach Lipman's
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found up to nine different
haplotypes in red-fruited tomato alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that the wild species all are
part of one haplotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually SP found, you know, SP accessions
are found in I think four or five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even SP itself, the fully wild
relative, there's a lot of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this graph can be interpreted as that
the darker blue boxes are, to the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: my knowledge, they look like full length
coding, no weird, you know, premature stop
[SPEAKER_00]: code on genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think they're functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're light blue, there's a couple of
mutations in there, including premature
[SPEAKER_00]: stop codons or a frame shift that lead to
probably truncated protein and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: these are non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pink one or peach color,
I guess, MES3, that's an unusual one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one haplotype where MES3 is
full length.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the other haplotypes that have
some MES3, they're actually truncated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are shorter versions of that
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Libby has shown actually that MES3,
the shorter version, has still some
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, but it's not as good as MES1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think MES3 in the pink is still
functional.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can, of course, associate the
MES and the NSTG1 haplotypes with methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: salicylate levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for MES1 in panel A,
where you see haplotype two, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly, you know, the accession
belonging, the carrying, that haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: produce particularly high levels of methyl
salicylate and significantly higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, than haplotype six and seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for NSTG1, based on structural
variants alone, this was work we did with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Schatz and Michael Onge and Zach
Libman in the paper cited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find up to five different
haplotypes at NSTG1, of which three,
[SPEAKER_00]: one to three are considered functional
because there's still a functional protein
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four, it doesn't have, it has one copy
sort of, but it's not functioning as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And haplotype five is definitely a
knockout where both copies of the gene are
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, of course, we can look at the
interaction between the MES and the NSTG1
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you see the nine different
haplotypes of MES1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the nine squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in color, whether they have NSTG1
haplotype one to three or four or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here haplotype two,
the one that leads to significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels increase further if you have an
inactive version of NSTG1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary here with haplotype six and seven
for MES, you see that they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulating very low levels of methyl
salicylate, no matter what the locus or
[SPEAKER_00]: the allele is at NSTG1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to remind you, here's the pathway
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out MES1 and you knock out
NSTG1, you really are able to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you this slide before.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of our knowledge, the blue
color indicates it is a functional gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these haplotypes seem to be
able to produce a functional copy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: MES1 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I showed you too that haplotype two is
particularly associated with high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting that that haplotype is actually
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gene, MES1, still looks
functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then we did some expression
analysis, just QRTPCR, where on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: you see about six or seven accessions that
belong to haplotype six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the levels of methyl
salicylate are really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then haplotype two is below,
is also six accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that the levels of methyl salicylate
are very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see by eye here that
in haplotype two, none of the MES genes
[SPEAKER_00]: are even expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in haplotype six, three of the
four MES genes are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly MES1, but also MES3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that explains why MES2 is knocked out,
even though we don't know why the genes
[SPEAKER_00]: are just not expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, of course, we know where all
these accessions were collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were collected in South America and
Central America and in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is a graph that shows where
different haplotypes of the MES locus were
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the first block here is the five
or six different haplotypes of SP,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a lot of variation in SP alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the darker blue indicates the
haplotype two, the non-functional
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that that's quite well selected
against during domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's rarely found in cultivated,
well, not in our collection, but also not
[SPEAKER_00]: in ancestral SLL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead in ancestral SLL, you have
haplotype six and seven that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also color coded on the
map, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue haplotype two, you can see
it's found here in Ecuador along the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast, but also in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the situation for NSGT1,
where the functional haplotypes one
[SPEAKER_00]: through three are found in all the SP
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then during domestication,
more and more, we didn't select for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most functional haplotypes that there's
locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the least functional, the one
that's clearly non-functional is haplotype
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also find these in roughly the
same area in Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can superimpose that with
levels of methyl salicylate that were
[SPEAKER_00]: found in these accessions in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that accessions that produce
high levels of methyl salicylate are found
[SPEAKER_00]: again in Ecuador corresponding to a
non-functional allele of NSGT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a non-functional allele of MESS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm wrapping up this presentation,
I just wanted to summarize all our
[SPEAKER_00]: findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: With MESS and NSGT1, we present a range of
alleles in red-fruited tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than I thought was possible,
but for volatiles, I guess, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous variation out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected very much for a functional
allele at MESS and a non-functional allele
[SPEAKER_00]: at NSGT1 during domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could hypothesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the opposite of what was found
in SP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that is either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting questions to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but what I was told by one of my
former graduate students who worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: Bayer now, but most of our lead tomato
varieties are all carrying the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: allele of NSGT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeders and companies have clearly
selected for a functional allele at that
[SPEAKER_00]: locus to keep the levels of methyl
salicylate low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the geographic distribution,
of course, of these alleles in Ecuador,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest that there's maybe a need for
accessions in Ecuador to carry higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of methyl salicylate, perhaps to
fend off insect herbivores or other
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, yeah, or other diseases that
might be important for the life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'll just finish up with
this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thanking the folks in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, my graduate student,
Manoj, who's pretty much his entire thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: is presented here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lara Pereira has done a lot of work
with Manoj on that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Libby, and Denise at the
University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I am happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually go overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, this is the first time I'm
like early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your question is how often do you find
this level of variation at the locus?
Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how often, what's the link between,
you know, good tasting tomato and yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, there is a correlation that,
you know, you can show that larger
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes tend to have less flavor and the
fruit quality is going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Denise has shown that in
their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is, though, that that's possibly
caused by the lack of knowledge of where
[SPEAKER_00]: the loci are that you need to keep to have
a good tasting tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to, you know, to analyze
volatiles, you have to have specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a really good biochemist on the
project to figure it out, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: grammatogram I showed you was the best
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of them are not that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's a lot of, you know,
oh, Denise, how do I measure this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do I quantify, you know,
this one is all shifted or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is actually quite, it's not easy to
quantify the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having said that, you know,
the volatiles that we're looking at are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in such low quantities that we
don't think that it's creating such a
[SPEAKER_00]: drain on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that we can, you know,
we should be able to create better tasting
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes without compromising yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shall see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be more is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its question is about, you know,
using actually that those resequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes and do GWAS again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I know, so, you know, what we do now,
I mean, I don't want to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of that data set that Zach created
because it's enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we're a new locus, first thing
is like, what's the genome structure in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't always have the parent
sequence, but something related.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of volatile loci
actually are structural variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get very quickly then an idea
whether, you know, whether there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: structural variant likely to be causative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, we could redo the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everything set up in the lab that
all these reference genomes like 14 or so
[SPEAKER_00]: are all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, we can always align the short
reads to any reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you take a pimpi and you align
it to the Heinz, you have a lot of snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very nice pimpi genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's helpful to figure out what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do more one on one at the time
base, one locus at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think we can, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would cost just time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My student wants to graduate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think salicylic acid can prime plant
immune responses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it kind of has a hormonal function
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering how often you are
looking at these different volatiles and
[SPEAKER_03]: come across something that seems to have
some kind of hormonal function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So salicylic acid and methyl salicylate
are definitely in the phenylpropanopather
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important in defense signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether other volatiles are important in
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know when the plant, when the,
yeah, the plant is diseased, we get a
[SPEAKER_00]: different volatile profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be really careful with also
when we are in the lab and selecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit has to be like perfect fruit,
not too ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they're overripe, they have
another volatile profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually don't know the answer to
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I actually, we're creating knockouts
in the different mesh genes wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wonder what, you know,
hopefully working in the future with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathologists or so to figure out if you
knock out mesh three, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the plant more susceptible to,
I don't know, some pathogen infection and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some anecdotal references about
methyl salicylate levels in roots and then
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing cis nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's possibly important to
methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harry once said, well, the levels of
methyl salicylate have gone up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes that we assayed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought it was because,
you know, if you have a little higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of methyl salicylate, you have a
little bit better disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: just general resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's possibly what breed is selected
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I possibly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever eaten one of these winter
green tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it's like, it's like, yeah,
minty is what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I maybe, I don't want to know,
but we've, we've tasted all these
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I have one post-doc where like when we
would, this was the first year,
[SPEAKER_00]: then she stopped, but she would taste
every tomato that we got from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious if the catalog of the
desirable tomato volatiles in research has
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced to the point where people will be
able to go to the grocery store and give
[SPEAKER_02]: them like the Chanel number five treatment
to just give them a spritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have like the ideal bouquet of
aromas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good question for Denise or
Harry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because it's also pregnant,
it's a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a study done in Europe,
I don't know, a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and the Italians like this type of
tomato and the Dutch people like another
[SPEAKER_00]: type and they were not even overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard also anecdotal stories of
like, you know, undergraduates in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, this really tastes like a good
tomato, but it was considered a poor
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a tomato that you can buy in the
grocery stores and people are familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your young people are familiar with that
type of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that's so possible to
create one aroma, one type of aroma for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's also very, it's not so
stable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the produce are longer in the store,
you know, they're going to lose some of
[SPEAKER_00]: their flavor over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through another spritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They change their color.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make sure it's red.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think perhaps in the future.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'll be working on that.
Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with Mets, you basically got a
collection of alleles that are encoding
[SPEAKER_02]: functional genes with expression
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and your expression data,
is that all fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the expression data that I showed was
just from ripe fruit collected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering, do you think there was
selection for kind of fruit specific
[SPEAKER_02]: alterations of expression?
[SPEAKER_02]: These genes may be more highly expressed
in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these genes expressed elsewhere in
the plant and, or maybe in the haplotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't express these genes at all in
the fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at that in public databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like this locus is very fruit
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that, you know, especially Mets 3
is just not on anywhere except for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breaker stage and then ripe is
very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mets 1 is expressed a little bit
higher earlier on, but it goes up during
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mets 2, we have actually not found
expression of that in any of the tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: in public database.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what Mets 2 is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mets 4 is also kind of hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working with a group in Knoxville,
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fong Chen, and he's interested in methyl
salicylate in roots and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been quantifying this
collection for methyl salicylate levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots and the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we get there, you know,
they want to share the data with us so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can run it through the GWAS pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see if the same locus
contributes to methyl salicylate levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: other parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant is, you know, methyl
salicylate levels still can go up in those
[SPEAKER_00]: that produce very low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is attacked, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other mechanisms to turn on the
production of, you know, salicylic acid to
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for breeders, well, I would recommend
functional at NSDT1 and a functional copy
[SPEAKER_00]: at MES as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MES locus is largely selected already
in the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to make crosses to,
you know, wild relatives or so for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance or other traits, you want to
make sure you get the right haplotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: MES in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we can tell breeders in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little simpler story,
but there's still variation out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still more out there to be
mined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
