[SPEAKER_04]: Hello and welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're logged into the fourth of 12 Berry
Soil and Nutrient Management webinars,
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsored by the Northeast Sustainable
Research and Extension Program,
[SPEAKER_02]: better known as Northeast SARE,
and hosted by Cornell University
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Horticulture and Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Kathy Heidenreich, and I'll be
your host for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to take care of a few
housekeeping things before we begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the note in the notes box.
[SPEAKER_02]: About webinar number six, it was
originally scheduled for 9-12,
[SPEAKER_02]: and because of a schedule conflict,
it had to be moved to, not 9-12,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, 12-9, had to be moved to 12-16,
and we apologize for any inconvenience in
[SPEAKER_02]: the dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to point out to you that
there's a new file that you can download
[SPEAKER_02]: in the files box, the Sphere Fact Sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a list of agronomy fact sheets
that the Cornell Nutrient Management
[SPEAKER_02]: Program has put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have implications across a wider
range of crops, and so Marvin Pritz,
[SPEAKER_02]: our speaker from last week, has selected
several of those titles, and he thinks
[SPEAKER_02]: that they will help provide some
background information for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: so feel free to download that list of fact
sheets and the URLs to get to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other housekeeping things that
I'd like to take care of is during our
[SPEAKER_02]: first webinar, we inadvertently omitted
pre-test question number 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to do is open that now,
and if you'll just select the answer that
[SPEAKER_02]: best fits your knowledge, we'll get that
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the poll is open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please register your response.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll move it over here where you can see
it a little better.
There.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wait a couple more seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are still signing in to give them a
chance to participate in the poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I will open it again at the end so
that those who joined us later can have a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to remind you, during the
presentation, if you have comments or
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, feel free to put them into the
chat box, and Eric Hansen, our speaker,
[SPEAKER_02]: will be watching that while he's speaking,
and we'll address them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also participate by using the
little signals at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the man with his hand raised on
the top menu bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of options for you to make
some sort of a comment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use those as we go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, there are links in the box on
the bottom left.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is for Northeast SARE.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second is for the webinar archives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each webinar is recorded and posted on
Monday of the following week so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can review it, or if you missed it,
so that you'll be able to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ready to shift to the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our speaker today is Dr. Eric Hansen from
Michigan State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew up in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: and earned his bachelor's degree from
Nassan College, his MS from the University
[SPEAKER_02]: of Maine studying low bush blueberries,
and his PhD at Oregon State University
[SPEAKER_02]: working in orchard nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's now professor and extension
specialist in the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Horticulture at MSU.
[SPEAKER_02]: His primary responsibility is to provide
production information to berry crop
[SPEAKER_02]: producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also does research on a variety of
production topics, including
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilization, weed management,
high tunnel berry production, growth
[SPEAKER_02]: regulator use, and organic production
challenges for blueberries and
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: His teaching includes classes on plant
mineral nutrition and berry crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kathy, and hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited about this because we have
quite a bit of time to cover a topic in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair amount of detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks, Kathy and Marvin, for putting
on this, organizing this webinar series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we'll be talking about means of
correcting soil nutritional problems for
[SPEAKER_01]: berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we'll just emphasize pre-plant
considerations and things you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of things beyond
nutrition that, of course, you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about prior to planting any
berry crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at a bare site,
there are things that you ought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about that may relate to
nutrition or they may not relate to
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things that come to my mind are,
first, to have a good appreciation of how
[SPEAKER_01]: texture varies across a site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your site may contain one or more soil
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where those breaks in soil type occur,
because that may influence how you manage
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition in coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might consider the history of
management on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had it been used for farming for a long
time, do you think it would benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: some cover cropping or manure or compost
additions that would build up organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there wet spots?
[SPEAKER_01]: This does relate to nutrition to some
degree, because it interacts with
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there are poorly drained areas,
you might consider also where tile
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage and or surface ditching may help
to get rid of excessive water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, of course, have you done
the adequate job of soil testing for pH
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrient levels prior to establishing
your plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that topic was covered in the
previous webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of things to consider other than
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think previously webinars covered topics
of soil analyses and wanted to reiterate,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, that there are a number of
private and university labs that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: choose from to do soil analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my opinion is you should pick one and
stick with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just use the interpretation
recommendations from that lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of course, different labs use
different analytical and extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: methods for nutrients and pH and lime
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make it simpler on yourself and stick
with one lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first consideration prior to
planting is, of course, pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have two basic groups of berry
crops here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And brambles and strawberries tend to like
slightly acidic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries and cranberries are very acid
loving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are way down on the pH scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first order of business is getting
the pH in the range where you would like
[SPEAKER_01]: it for these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the pH is too low, liming is in
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lime is essentially calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dissolves slowly in soil
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it releases calcium and carbonate
anions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how pH is reduced by liming
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of different liming
materials and a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations for choosing the best type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reasons for liming are, first,
to reduce a possibility of toxic levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum or manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as pH increases, the solubility of
those two elements declines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you reduce the availability of those to
the plants and the potential for toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liming supplies calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the source, magnesium,
it increases the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus if you're outside of the range
required by the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has some kind of interesting
effects on microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those are nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fixation, so legumes tend to do better at
a higher pH range in terms of their
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency of nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium
to produce nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes that are responsible for that
also prefer a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So liming tends to speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, organic matter
decomposition and nitrogen mineralization
[SPEAKER_01]: from organic matter tend to be promoted by
more neutral pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you choose a lime source?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a number of different considerations
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the neutralizing value,
so how effective it is in increasing pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reaction rate, and this is essentially
dictated by the size of the lime
[SPEAKER_01]: particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The need for magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the cost of the
material, how easy it is to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the availability in your
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the neutralizing value
of lime materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all measured relative to
that of pure calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how they're all compared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's given a neutralizing value of
100.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dolomitic lime can be a little lower
or a little higher than pure calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcitic lime or high cal lime tends to be
a little bit lower than pure calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate, because it has some impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrated lime is much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher in activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marl, excuse me a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to cough here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting over a cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marl is kind of a lime mud, and it's mined
in different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that varies a whole lot in liming
neutralizing value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can be pretty close to limestone
or much, much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I listed gypsum at the bottom
just to indicate that that is not a liming
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people think about calcium as being a
liming material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium sulfate or gypsum has no effect
on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other consideration,
then, is the speed of reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is pretty much dictated by the
particle size and how that influences the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface area of lime materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this chart indicates a breakdown of the
particles by size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smaller mesh size are the larger
particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mesh size is holes per inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the vertical axis is the
percentage of the material reacting in
[SPEAKER_01]: three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see material that's larger than
mesh size of 20, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: reacts fairly well within a year or two of
application to soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff between mesh size 8 and 20 reacts
very slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less than half of it's reacted within
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then material that's very big,
0 to 8 mesh size, is almost inert in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about the value of a
lime material, if it contains a lot of 8
[SPEAKER_01]: to 20 mesh size particles, that stuff's
pretty much worthless from a quick acting
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint in soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smaller the mesh size, or the
smaller the particles, the quicker these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are going to react in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another type of lime that's used in fruit
production in various areas is pelletized,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sometimes called Pell Lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this material is actually a very fine
mesh material, up to 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be either calcitic,
a high cal lime, or a dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's formulated into small pellets
using binders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pellets are fairly big,
but it's important to realize that the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual limestone in it is very fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pell Lime generally reacts about as
quickly and neutralizes the very same
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As agglime with the same neutralizing
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some question about,
you can imagine that you're putting this
[SPEAKER_01]: large pellet of almost powdered limestone
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does create kind of a high pH zone
around that immediate area of the pellet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, the remainder of the
pellet may inhibit the solubility of the
[SPEAKER_01]: remainder of the pellet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some question about whether the
fact that it comes in a pellet or not
[SPEAKER_01]: affects how quickly it reacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a good answer for you on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, I would think of Pell Lime
as acting about the same as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: neutralizing value of regular agglime.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason to consider this is because
it's pelletized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spread it through any fertilizer
spreader, and it's easy to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that a lot of lime materials are
dusty, and you can actually lose some
[SPEAKER_01]: during application to the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wouldn't be the case with a
pelleted material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you need to pay for all that
convenience, so these pelleted materials
[SPEAKER_01]: are much more expensive than regular
agglime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't get this to speed along here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it speeds along too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So occasionally, we're interested in
lowering soil pH for raspberries and
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is uncommon, but it's certainly a
common desire for blueberry sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that pH can be
higher than desired range for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under Michigan conditions,
if we get a pH above 5.5 or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: we start seeing this iron chlorosis that
you see in the pictures here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to avoid that by planting
blueberries in a soil with a proper pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of materials that
will reduce soil pH, but sulfur is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best one to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the brand, this can come
as prills.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come as chips or even powdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these materials range from 90% to 95%
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a recommendation is for 500 pounds
per acre, you'd want to increase that by
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: On account of the lower than 100% content
of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prills are, of course, easiest to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're low in dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easy to spread with a fertilizer
spreader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chipped sulfur is kind of intermediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to come with a lot of different
chip sizes, and it's also with quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of dust in the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, powdered is difficult to
use altogether, although I sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend powdered sulfur to acidify the
soil around a couple of blueberry bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: in somebody's backyard, because they can
buy a small quantity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron sulfate is a salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also reduces soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reacts quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reacts quickly in soils, but it's very
expensive, because it's about one sixth as
[SPEAKER_01]: potent as sulfur for reducing soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to use a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, there may be a potential
for salt stress if you're using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: this material immediately before planting
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aluminum sulfate is pretty much the
same as iron sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it requires high rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it contains aluminum,
there's a potential for accumulating toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not generally recommended
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sulfur is the best choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people think about using
acidifying nitrogen fertilizers to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: soil pH, and I wanted to talk about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammonium sulfate is a very acidic nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps to maintain soil pH low,
but it shouldn't be used to reduce soil pH
[SPEAKER_01]: initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that if you're applying
enough of that to reduce pH, you'll apply
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge amount of nitrogen that's not
needed and may be damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, one pound of sulfur
provides about the same acidity as 2.8
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a recommendation for 500
pounds of sulfur, this would be equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: to an application of 1,400 pounds of
ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would deliver almost 300 pounds
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not something you'd want to put on
prior to planting blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly wouldn't be efficient and
probably wouldn't be very cost effective
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a question from Jeff about how
important is sulfur to this group of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, I haven't seen or heard of
any instances where sulfur is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient in this group of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sulfur, of course, is an essential
element.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most soils contain adequate levels for
these crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not to say that it can't happen,
but I'd say it's uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a comment from Charlie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for blueberries and
cranberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is true, but again, if pH is
acidic enough for those crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's automatically abundant levels
of sulfate in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think of any instances where
you'd have to apply sulfur strictly as a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of those soils contain
adequate sulfur levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jeff has another question with Lesley.
[SPEAKER_01]: With less sulfur and rainwater,
could we start seeing sulfur deficiency on
[SPEAKER_01]: coarse soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think certainly possible, but no
incidences of that that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think related to that is the switch away
from sulfur as a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a number of those materials
that had been applied routinely for
[SPEAKER_01]: different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps the needs will change over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little bit about sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this material is oxidized by a specific
group of bacteria in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a biological process,
and it works very well when the soil is
oxidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils are moist and warm and well aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bacteria oxidize the sulfur to
produce sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a biological process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind that nothing much happens
during the off season when the soils are
[SPEAKER_01]: too cold for those bacteria to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we normally think of sulfur as
requiring the better part of a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season to fully react in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take a little longer than that,
or it may take a little less than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much is applied,
and perhaps a microbial community in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing is to try to
incorporate it for good distribution in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone for quick reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were establishing a site for
blueberries, for example, and you needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply sulfur to reduce pH, you have a
choice of broadcasting that material or
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps banding it along the rows where
the blueberry bushes will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most cases, I think it's best to
broadcast over the whole site.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in some cases where, particularly
on a heavier soil that's highly buffered,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it may be better to, or most
economical, to band it where the bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: will go, because you only need to apply
perhaps half as much as you would
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy, I can't seem to advance things real
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the amount of sulfur required
to reduce pH to a level of four,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with initial pH of five or five,
five, six, or six, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important point I wanted to make
here is how instrumental the soil type is
[SPEAKER_01]: to the amount of sulfur that's required to
drop pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that for a given drop in
pH, it will take two or three times as
[SPEAKER_01]: much to drop pH on a loam soil opposed to
a sand, and then four or five times as
[SPEAKER_01]: much to drop it on a clay opposed to a
sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why people say that it may not
be economical to produce blueberries on a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil with a very high initial pH if that
soil is also highly buffered, a heavier
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a great deal of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, as a caution, we'd say if
you're applying more than 500 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, you probably should consider
splitting that application into two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to mention also that sulfur can
produce hydrogen sulfide in soils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly drained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are waterlogged areas in the
field, hydrogen sulfide can be produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's toxic to plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can cause damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a situation like this, you can
imagine that if a grower put his sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: down prior to planting these young
blueberries, and he has these flooded or
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly drained areas, that you could have
toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop in those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's primarily because of the
anaerobic conditions in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-plant phosphorous use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the recommendation here would be to
incorporate prior to planting at rates
[SPEAKER_01]: indicated by soil test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can choose materials based on the
cost per unit of P2O5 anaerobic and the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of phosphorous from those
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the standard materials, super phosphate
and concentrated super phosphate,
[SPEAKER_01]: are nearly all available, meaning they're
all almost 100% soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the choice between those, of course,
would be based on the cost per unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: P2O5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned rock phosphate here because
this is the mineral that these other
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate fertilizers are manufactured
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fairly high in phosphorous,
but very low in soluble phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it may have some utility in
organic settings, but also in blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: settings where you want a slow release of
phosphorous over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in high pH soils, rock phosphate would
be non-effective because the solubility
[SPEAKER_01]: goes down as pH goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in acidic soils, this might be a nice
material to supply a gradual release of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorous over time, as long as the pH
is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff is asking split sulfur applications
that you plow down half and disk in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I think more about perhaps
applying half in one season and then half
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring prior to planting so that
you have part of that reacting in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: at different time intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And problems with applying mono ammonium
or diammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pre-plant, those materials don't make
much sense as phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you really don't want to be
putting a whole lot of nitrogen in to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground prior to planting, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that they're very,
very expensive sources of phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need the nitrogen in those
materials, then it is an economic source
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two nutrients, but all you're
looking for is phosphorous, then it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive source of phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric, are you still having problems
advancing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if it had something to
do with the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can advance from here if you just tell
me when.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pre-plant potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you'd be incorporating this
prior to planting at rates based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the materials of choice would be
dependent on the cost, again, per unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So per unit of K2O, the need for other
nutrients, and the potential hazard from
[SPEAKER_04]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the typical materials are potassium
chloride or mucus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period of potash and potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are fairly high in K2O
percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium chloride is the least expensive
of these based on a per unit of K2O basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium sulfate's a little bit more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potassium magnesium sulfate would be a
quite high cost source of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other consideration then is what
other nutrients would you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if soil tests indicate that magnesium
is low, then this potassium magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate or SOPO mag may be a good choice
economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the potential hazard of from
chlorine, I wanted to mention a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you usually have a choice between SOP,
or the sulfate, and the muriate,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the potassium chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the muriate is nearly always quite a
bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it contains chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a potential for causing damage
to plants because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my feeling on use of this is that if
you're using relatively low levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 pound rates, maybe up to 200 pound
rates of potassium, that chloride is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably safe on most of these crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you are on a sandy soil and are
concerned about this, and you still want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go with a cheaper chloride source,
that application in the fall would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you apply chloride in the fall,
most of that anion is going to leach out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the root zone by the end of the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that reduces the potential risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you're using lower rates of
potash, I think in most cases the muriate
[SPEAKER_01]: is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have some concern about safety,
then you might consider applying that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall so that you give time for the
chloride to leach out of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you advance that, Cathy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preplant magnesium and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, incorporate prior to planting
based on soil test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here the choice of materials would be
based on the cost per unit of nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, the need for a pH adjustment,
and then the need for other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cheapest source of calcium and
magnesium would be the limestones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcitic lime is normally greater than 30%
calcium and quite low in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dolomitic lime is lower in calcium and
higher in magnesium, but the actual ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: vary depending on the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would be the good choices if
you're trying to increase pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need magnesium but you don't want
to increase pH, then magnesium sulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need it, you did calcium but you
did not want to increase pH, then calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate would be a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, potassium, magnesium
sulfate, Sopal Mag provides both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk a little bit about an
interesting case of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this came out of work that Marvin
Pritz did a number of years ago in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole story, my thinking is not in
on this, but it's an interesting situation
[SPEAKER_01]: in that gypsum that supplies calcium but
doesn't alter pH is known to be real
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial in soils that are either
saline, meaning high in salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sodic, meaning high in sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those cases, gypsum tends to improve
adhesion of clay micelles to one another
[SPEAKER_01]: to the flocculation, and that improves
water infiltration and drainage in those
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, though, that we don't normally
run into high salt or certainly high
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium soils in the eastern US because
it's a humid environment with plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: precipitation most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other interesting thing about this
that came out of Marvin's work is gypsum
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced raspberry root rot, which is
caused by a phytophthora species in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little bit later, there was some
additional work in Washington state that
[SPEAKER_01]: also showed a benefit of gypsum
applications where phytophthora was a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these observations aren't entirely
confined to raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gypsum has reduced phytophthora
diseases of avocado and soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't put a reference in there,
but also on ginseng.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are different fungal species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gypsum seems to benefit the plants
in each regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting thing about it is that
the effect of gypsum doesn't seem to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: soil water drainage or physical
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a fairly specific effect of
high calcium concentrations that inhibit
[SPEAKER_01]: the reproductive growth of the fungi and
also inhibit the growth of the fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marvin's recommendation, and I agree
with this, is that to incorporate three to
[SPEAKER_01]: six tons of gypsum prior to planting
raspberries on sites where there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: history of phytophthora root rot,
the additional question would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: how about sites without a history of
phytophthora root rot?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, what about red steel of
strawberries, which is also a phytophthora
[SPEAKER_01]: problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't find any literature on
that, but certainly there's a potential
[SPEAKER_01]: for affecting any phytophthora species by
enhancing free calcium concentrations in
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you advance that, Cathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other question related to that
would be, would you get that response
[SPEAKER_01]: irregardless of how much calcium is
naturally in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Michigan, we think about a balance
of potassium, magnesium, and calcium in
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's expressed as a percentage of
the total balance of bases that are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you went through this in a
previous webinar to some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the question this raises is,
if you're working in a soil that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: abundantly supplied with calcium,
is more calcium in the form of gypsum
[SPEAKER_01]: going to provide some benefit as far as
phytophthora control?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that's known at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, an interesting effect of a
specific ion, calcium, on fungal growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and disease suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you advance that again, Cathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salt stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to go into this in a little
bit more detail when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient additions to established plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little bit of background here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high soil salt levels tend to be
problems in arid regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're much less of an issue for us in
the eastern US because precipitation tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to leach soil salts out of the topsoil
horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, growers can create these
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can create them by applying excessive
fertilizers or inappropriate types of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers at the wrong time,
or by using a high salt irrigation water
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the importance of this is that these
berry crops we're concerned about are
[SPEAKER_01]: among the least tolerant of elevated salt
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly something to be
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are just some rankings of
different fruit crops and their tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: to soil electrical conductivity,
which is the way that soil salt levels are
[SPEAKER_01]: measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the number of the
tree fruit crops are quite a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerant than our blackberries or
raspberries or strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries weren't listed here,
but my thought is that they would be right
[SPEAKER_01]: down there with raspberries or
strawberries and perhaps even a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more sensitive to all salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly something we should be
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effect of fertilizers on salt
content of the soil has been pretty well
[SPEAKER_01]: documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's expressed as a salt index.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are some of the standard nitrogen
sources, fertilizer sources, and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: the salt index for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit more about
this in the webinar after the holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point I wanted to make is quite
often there are published values for salt
[SPEAKER_01]: indices for different types of
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are essentially per unit of
fertilizer, not per unit of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although ammonium nitrate has a salt
index of 105, very high, it contains a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher concentration of nitrogen than some
other nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you extrapolate that salt index on a
per unit of fertilizer basis per pound of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, what you find is that the
potential for a salt injury might be less
[SPEAKER_01]: using that than it would be if you're
using calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the assumption being that if you
desired to apply a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, that you would contribute less
salt for that amount of nitrogen using the
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium nitrate than you would with
calcium nitrate, even though calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate is often touted as being a more
safe fertilizer from a salt standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you advance me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are salt indices for phosphorus
and potassium fertilizers, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, phosphorus
fertilizers are relatively low in salt
[SPEAKER_01]: indices, except for the ammoniated
phosphates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium sources, chloride has a higher
risk of salt injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you advance that again, Kathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a little bit about organic
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen sources, a lot of different
materials here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to point out just some of the
higher nitrogen content organic sources
[SPEAKER_01]: would be dried blood and fish meal and
nitrate of soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check with certifiers to see
which types of these are allowable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus, bone meal, fish meal are good
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kelp and wood ash would be good
sources of potash.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about pre-plant manure and
compost additions and when those would be
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this has a lot of significance
now with increasing prices of conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are national prices per pound of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably different with dealers in
your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a national average, prices for
these nitrogen fertilizers has doubled in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would guess that they're not going to go
down from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are similar prices nationally
for a couple of sources of phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've more than doubled in the last
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then prices for potassium chloride,
which is also more than doubled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is useful to think about this
because it kind of changes the pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of these materials relative to
what you get in compost and manure
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's manure or compost,
if you calculate cost per unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, somebody is getting very close
to cost of conventional nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, organic matter has a number
of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be most beneficial on
sandy soils or those that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily farmed for a number of years where
organic additions were not put back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these materials should be analyzed
first before applying them so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid problems with excessive total salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excessive phosphorus, nitrogen tie-up or
excessive availability of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then some elemental toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply and incorporate raw manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably best in the fall before
spring planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid using any manure or compost which
has relatively high salt levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's measured as electrical
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, if the level is above 10
deciSiemens per meter, that indicates a
[SPEAKER_01]: potential problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could apply materials with moderate
salt levels in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if they're applied in the fall,
much of the salt exposure would be leached
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the root zone by the spring when
you're planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd reduce the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, manure types vary
enormously in nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these values are given in pounds per
ton of manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: An issue that limits manure use in most
states is the phosphorus content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Michigan, our manure gaps are
generally accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ag management practices indicate that
first you should know soil and manure P
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if soil tests indicate that
there's a P, that P is needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: then apply enough manure to supply 100 to
200 pounds of P205 to the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, you need to know the content
of the material to know how much to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if, in this case, it's a break P1
extraction, soil tests indicates levels
[SPEAKER_01]: were 75 to 150 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then under our setting, we'd say that you
can only apply enough manure to replace
[SPEAKER_01]: crop removal, which is pretty minimal with
these berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, if soil test is above
150, then do not apply any manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not you can apply manure is
dictated by the phosphorus content of that
[SPEAKER_01]: manure, but also the salt content and the
potential for doing harm to the berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found these data, which were the
range in parameters of 20 compost samples
[SPEAKER_01]: from Massachusetts farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was back in 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the things I wanted you to look at
here were, first, the range in soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: salt content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we felt above 10 is problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some that was almost twice
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly, the carbon to nitrogen
ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that varied a great deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has consequences horticulturally
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Birnbaum at Michigan State University
has done a similar survey of commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: compost products from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top graph here is carbon to
nitrogen ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that they vary a great
deal from under 10 to 1 to up to over 25
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The saturated media extract is the
electrical conductivity or the salt
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can see that some of these
are very, very low and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of them that were
somewhat high and one that was
[SPEAKER_01]: disturbingly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the take home message is be sure you
know the characteristics of these
[SPEAKER_01]: materials before you use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the significance of a carbon to
nitrogen ratio is primarily on nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a list of organic materials that
you might consider putting into soil
[SPEAKER_01]: before planting berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sawdust has a carbon to nitrogen ratio of
500 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hugely deficient in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bark is a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straw, 80 to 1, is still very low in
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost, as you saw, varies quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be 25 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass clippings, 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken manure, down to 6 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think about these on a stability
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soils and stable compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that 25 to 30 to 1 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, materials in that
range aren't going to either supply
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, available nitrogen, or extract
available nitrogen from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you apply materials that are
increasingly lower carbon nitrogen ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: or higher nitrogen levels, you are
increasing the available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you apply materials that are
increasingly low in nitrogen, you tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the available nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these bark and sawdust tend to,
as they decompose, the microbes that do
[SPEAKER_01]: that work are more competitive than plant
roots for available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes increasingly difficult for
plants to extract nitrogen from those
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture on the bottom is a blueberry
planting in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several of the progressive growers in
Michigan are using wood chips,
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating those in the row before they
plant blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recognize that they need to increase
nitrogen rates if they do that to
[SPEAKER_01]: accommodate the breakdown of those chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing, and the reason
I want to mention that, is that they seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to get growth responses even on soils that
are pretty high in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's probably related to the
fact that this is large particulate matter
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're adding to a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often soils that are high in total
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may be small particles of organic
matter where the aeration that these chips
[SPEAKER_01]: provide seems to really benefit the
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy is asking, what would the desired
carbon to nitrogen ratio be for berry
[SPEAKER_01]: crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I would consider is that once
plants are in the ground, you would end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a carbon nitrogen ratio of 20 to 25,
I would guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you have modest availability of
nitrogen during the course of the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you're applying these high
carbon materials, you just need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of the fact that you'll need to
increase nitrogen supplies accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure there's an ideal or
desired carbon nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanted to talk just for a
minute about learning from one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes, many mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, we established
organic raspberry trial under high
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're concerned that you put these
raspberries in the ground in May,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're fall fruiters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have a nitrogen demand
for the next five months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you supply nitrogen to those
plants when rain is excluded?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organic trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are fewer soluble materials that
you can inject through the irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you put something in place in May
prior to planting that's going to sustain
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants through the growing season?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up incorporating up to 10 tons
of fortified dairy compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rows before we planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fortified with feather meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was somewhat higher in nitrogen
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was about June or July after May
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's salt stress on the plants due
to the incorporated compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did everything that you're not
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we analyzed the compost after we put
it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that it ended up being very,
very high, concerningly high in electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity or total salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then carbon to nitrogen ratio of
almost 8 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very high in nitrogen,
very high in salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a lot of difficulty with plant
death and poor growth because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would have been less of a
problem if it weren't under high tunnels
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're excluding precipitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have leached some of this
material out of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, that was our lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, I think important points
are to understand how the soil texture and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH nutrient content and drainage
varies across the site before you consider
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand the properties of all these
amendments and fertilizers before you make
[SPEAKER_01]: applications with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understand what salt content,
nutrient content, and various aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things before you use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you adjust pH well before
you're planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you're using a very fine lime,
consider that it's going to take a year
[SPEAKER_01]: for that lime to react significantly in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's incorporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes as well for sulfur additions
where it's going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, build soil phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium levels based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the recommendations of soil tests,
not based on what your neighbor has been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing for years that seems to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be more scientific than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, that's about all I wanted to
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably have some time for questions
if anybody wants to type something in that
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to cover or didn't cover very
clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be glad to try to address those
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eric, for an excellent
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're waiting for people to pose any
questions, I'm going to shift to the exit
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention that our speaker for
next the next webinar, which is December
[SPEAKER_02]: 2nd, is Dr. Marvin Pritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be talking about foliar
testing and sampling and visual assessment
[SPEAKER_02]: of nutrient status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to please note that webinar
number six, which was originally scheduled
[SPEAKER_02]: for 12-9, had to be moved to 12-16.
[SPEAKER_02]: We apologize for any inconvenience with
that and the short notice, but the webinar
[SPEAKER_02]: will be recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not able to join us on 12-16,
you'll be able to listen to the recorded
[SPEAKER_02]: version.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't completed the demographics
questionnaire or the educator pretest,
[SPEAKER_02]: please download those and email the
completed forms to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while Eric is answering any questions,
I'm going to open that poll again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't vote the first time,
please vote again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember the Spear fact sheets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are agronomy fact sheets,
which have some very good basic
[SPEAKER_02]: information that would be applicable also
to berry crops that Marvin provided for us
[SPEAKER_02]: from last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the poll, question 14 that we
missed from the educator pretest,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll have that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any questions for Eric
while we're waiting?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question from Glenn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not ban sulfur or other nutrients
instead of broadcast to reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: needed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so with sulfur, the issue there is
if you banned in a four or five foot wide
[SPEAKER_01]: band, soils tend to gravitate back to
their initial or native soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would have to watch more carefully
how soil pH changes over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's likely that you'll have to apply
more sulfur more quickly underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: bushes or within that band again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I say, it probably reduces some
work in monitoring if you can broadcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're working on a heavier soil
where the rate of sulfur required is cost
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitive, then you may want to consider
banding under the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly, does soil nutrition
between rows eventually impact plant
[SPEAKER_01]: supply through root extension or soil
diffusion?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I get that entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from my experience digging up
raspberries and blueberries in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are very few roots that extend far
beyond the canopy of the bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you certainly could supply some
nutrition in row middles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, they're most of the
feeder roots of those plants tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: confined underneath the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you again, Eric, for sharing
this very informative presentation with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be looking forward to your next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Welch will be the webinar host for the
next two webinars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be looking at managing nutrients
in established plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there aren't any further questions,
we'll close the webinar for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us.
