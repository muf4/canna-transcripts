[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really nice to be right after
Paul, because Paul's really, and his team
[SPEAKER_00]: have done a really great piece of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to do good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I did want to kind of mention,
a lot of people wonder what this Long
[SPEAKER_00]: Island thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did want to mention that we do have
a research station down in Long Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: right in Riverhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the eastern portion of Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been there 94 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting ready to celebrate our 100th
anniversary in about six more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in Suffolk County here,
which is the eastern almost two-thirds of
[SPEAKER_00]: the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're a very diverse agriculture
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I go out to speak,
I like to make sure that the people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that we have a lot of
agriculture out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually a very, the leading
county in the state of New York for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, as far as the wholesale
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons that
Cornell's down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the total ag products,
we're number two now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to be number one until about three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still we're number one for crop
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more nurseries and more
greenhouses than A Place House in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetables are number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other crops, like potatoes, we're number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ducks and poultry, we're still number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're down in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very fortunate, our research
center, we're the only one in the country
[SPEAKER_00]: that has specialists for each of the
commodity zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have floriculture greenhouse
specialists, fruit specialists,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the grapes, because we
have about 2,000 acres of grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable specialists, and then ornamental
specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also very fortunate to have
the cross-commodity specialists,
[SPEAKER_00]: two plant pathologists, Marjorie's here
today, a weed scientist, two
[SPEAKER_00]: entomologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of a one-stop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in what is true theoretical extension,
our stakeholders are about 50 mile radius
[SPEAKER_00]: from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to interact with them all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring in their diseases, and they
bring in their insects, or we go visit
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we do down in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, unlike Paul, I'm not a wildlife
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a plant breeder and greenhouse
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Margaret had mentioned earlier,
we have been breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the impatience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of last year, we came up with our
first two truly downy mildew-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: impatience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marjorie and her team in Long Island also
helped us with that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yuki here in the front row is going to be
working with us for the next several years
[SPEAKER_00]: on making that a seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, if you're going to grow this,
you'd have to propagate it by cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been working with Ulster Mary
for many years on developing winter
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer love those, by the way, so don't grow
those if you have deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also working on a project
breeding Vitex, the chase tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noor, a grad student, is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been working on that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what we're here to talk about
is deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deer are kind of more my hobby,
because I like to garden a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've always lived in areas that
have had deer populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think that they're very cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't want to hunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us on Long Island, deer are our
number one problem for farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as many of the homeowners out
there that have nice gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original title of this talk was
deer-resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might have noticed that I changed
it to plants that deer do not eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you use the term
deer-resistant, there is no plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a deer wants to bite it and chew it,
it's going to certainly eat the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that little spruce up there,
deer don't eat the spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they take a bite, it's not
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no plant is truly resistant if a deer
wants to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have other problems, as Paul
mentioned, too, the rubbing antlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do come up with a garden with
all these plants that are resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: deers, then the next thing you realize is
that in the fall, the male deer come
[SPEAKER_00]: along, and they rub the bark, and they
girdle the trees, and they kill them that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do they eat it, then they step
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all kinds of physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know our boxwoods at our house have been
damning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer don't eat boxwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will step on them when they're
trying to reach higher levels of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they do cosmetic damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classic photo of arboviti hedges
on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get devoured by the deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just nibble everything they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other part is that you're
walking through your garden, and you step
[SPEAKER_00]: in on all kinds of little presents that
they leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not very much fun either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Paul kind of mentioned this earlier,
but there are a lot of deer in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, according to a 2014 study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 15 million deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as he also mentioned,
we have other problems, like car accidents
[SPEAKER_00]: associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from the insurance company
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers have immeasurable damage from the
deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, those are hostas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say farmers, I include the
greenhouse, the floriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Lyme disease and all kinds of
other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the disease now that makes you
allergic to meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard about that one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a true disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a fairy tale when I first
heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last year, we've had so many people
that have come down with that disease now
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can't eat any kind of meat
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer do cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a fence around our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 68 acres at the Extension Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a cost of about $80,000, we put a fence
around the entire farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd be out of business if we didn't
have the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Paul mentioned, you should be about
8-foot fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fence and the deer management
or hunting are the only ways you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to truly be sure that
you're going to get rid of your deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul also mentioned repellents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't mention liquid fence,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised, because this is a really
good repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tried this in several situations,
deer out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two that work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid fence smells really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you spray it before a party,
people will stay away from your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, deer out smells like
cloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other problem with deer fence is
that it's a very thick mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put it in a spray bottle,
it really clogs up the spray bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they both work dependably.
I have a question on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've heard people say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a nursery landscape
environments in Long Island, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Manatec, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have beautiful gardens that are
subject to deer attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they consistently spray with one every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other thing that we didn't
mention earlier, Paul didn't mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that when he did that study,
he sprayed once and then saw how things
[SPEAKER_00]: were repelled for several months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a homeowner situation,
you should reapply, because they will wash
[SPEAKER_00]: off and the smell will get less unpleasant
to the deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's any problem to
rotating back and forth from one to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you necessarily need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've tried areas of just liquid
fence and just deer out, and it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of ingredient?
I don't know if I heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it smells really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the question, I think what the question
is, is do I find that these work for buck
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbing also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in just a couple of slides,
I'll show you that there's different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: we've worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is just to elevate your plants,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a homeowner, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the commercial world,
in the commercial business, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all pictures from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see we put window boxes in
where they can't reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say this little walkway in
between the house and the garage,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have come into there and eaten our
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use the window boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use hanging baskets where they can't
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even on our hen house,
we put a green roof on top of the hen
[SPEAKER_00]: house just to make them mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hen house serves dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only is it a place for the
chickens to live, but we let them out at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and they eat ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chickens are very good at tick
elimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't get them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will tell you, every day I'm out
in the garden, I get a tick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is to fence your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul mentioned that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a homeowner situation, we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fence them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want a rhododendron on Long
Island, you better fence it or else it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, what we do, this is a stewardia
that is fenced in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had sentimental meanings to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fenced it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just this year, it's been big enough,
thick enough, that I don't think the deer
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to rub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they start eating the lower part,
that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat the lower part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll enjoy the top part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also surrounded by bayberry,
which is one of my plants that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when deer go to rub, they like to have
a clear approach entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the bayberry, I hope that is also
going to deter them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're going to talk about today
is choosing the right plants for the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can have a beautiful garden in
spite of the deer situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another picture from my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed when Paul said 250 per square
mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to say I have a lot of
faith in this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil had passed out the list to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of faith in that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that on the list that we
have the asterisk plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I call my 95% plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 95% of the time, the deer won't
touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason we have faith in our list
is that we've actually done this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've replicated these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used these plants in different
locations that have deer pressure under
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to live in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 18 years, we had gardens there that
had a lot of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we moved to Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've replicated these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very confident about this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my wife and I, Margo, we both like
to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we garden a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our situation, we have a sun garden
where we can test sun plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a shade garden,
a woodland garden, where we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: woodland plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one year, Marjorie was doing a study
with junipers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had these junipers left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, you want to use these for
deer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took all these plants home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spread them around so we have
different locations on the property to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that the deer had access to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to judge them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say that's why we feel
very confident about this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people always say this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I speak at groups around the country,
they're going to say, well, if a deer is
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry enough, they're going to eat
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain plants that are
really poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the foxglove, the tour,
the monk's hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a very poisonous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ate those plants, we'd be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If deer ate those plants, they'd be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not completely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will believe what Paul said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul said that if you have such a high
pressure and that they're starving to
[SPEAKER_00]: death, they'll probably eat some of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Long Island, Connecticut isn't really
a situation where there are other gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can eat other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do today,
I can't obviously talk about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on your list because we only have a
half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about some of the
annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about some of the
herbaceous perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, more herbaceous perennials
because this group is more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the woodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just talk until the time's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil, you have to stop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my time's up, I'll just stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then this afternoon, when we're
out of Bluegrass Lane, we'll walk through
[SPEAKER_00]: the trowel gardens out there, the
perennial gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more about perennials then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sorry, about plants that are
resistant to deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feel free to yell out any questions
you have as I go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleome are one of these plants,
I think, if those of you who are growers
[SPEAKER_00]: or have nurseries, you've probably seen
this plant quite popular in recent years,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly some of the new cultivars
that have been released, the Cleome
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosalita, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is being grown probably not
because it's deer resistant, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite deer resistant, but because it's
short, it's compact, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: floriferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any of the Cleome or spider flowers do
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their annuals, the Rosalita sterile,
so it won't recede itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other, the Cleome haslorana,
will recede itself and it will act as a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it's an annual,
it will continue to come up for you every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't try the Colocasias
or the Allocasias because they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those corms is about $10,
$12 on Long Island, $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're about $10 on Long Island too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're kind of pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's okay, because you can put them
out in your garden and enjoy them for the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer and actually dig them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig up all mine in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they've frosted down, I just cut them
off, dig them out, shake all the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then throw them in my basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't freeze and they dry all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the spring, I take them and plant
them outside and they do fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though expensive, they do work
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Allocasias, the same way, kind of a
nicer, showy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves, the foliage is more upright in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But annual plants, they don't flower,
they just offer that foliage kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: attractiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotiana is an interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nicotiana sylvestris.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the white plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried other Nicotianas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little Nicotiana, the little tobaccos
that are so popular, other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that this is the only
species that actually is resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't touch this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other tobaccos that we've tried and
tried several times, they will eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't quite understand that,
but this is what we've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one of those annuals that
will recede itself and come up year after
[SPEAKER_00]: year as a perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want this plant, it's a tall
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tall and showy and really nice in
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a plant that does well in full
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does well in a partial shade
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penicetums are really nice ornamental
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might talk about another
ornamental grass later on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I haven't trialed every grass
that there is, I would be willing to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that probably every grass, every
ornamental grass is resistant to deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen grasses eaten by deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple fountain grass is really
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see you can really make some nice
designs with coleas and other kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: allocations and other things to make a
nice pot or even a nice section in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these you do need to repurchase
because they are annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so those were my annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ones on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the herbaceous perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that the Monkswood,
one of the most poisonous plants there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of that plant is poisonous from
the flowers to the leaves to the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: deer tend to stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also mention that some plants
that are resistant will occasionally get
[SPEAKER_00]: nibbled on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this particular plant, I have several
of these in our gardens and I noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: at one point the tops were nibbled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember that your deer
population may be changing, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring when you have all the baby
deer, the young fawns walking through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not yet learned that these
plants are poisonous or don't taste well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll take a little nibble and then
of course they damage your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not going to eat the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be back after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they take their first taste,
they usually leave the plant alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agastache, very dependable plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also on Connie's list for
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very hardy perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the fragrance that these
leaves give off to keep the deer away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of pollinators go to these plants
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say though, if you grow this plant,
it is, I don't want to use the I word,
[SPEAKER_00]: the invasive word, but it will spread a
lot in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a great plant, you can get in propels
and white and blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aliens are very resistant to the deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always kind of surprised me that plants
like this, which we eat, we find as
[SPEAKER_00]: culinary plants, the deer won't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic chives are interesting,
however.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic chives for us down in Long
Island are just starting to bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part actually that you would
need if you're going to use it in cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: before the flowers actually open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when they're more in this
bud-like stage here, that's when you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them to put them into different kinds of
eggs or whatever you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that the deer, if they do
eat this plant, they will eat it when the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not frequently, but they will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue star, which is a native plant,
the Amsonia tabernum Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a plant that is promoted
as a shade plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does quite well in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that flowers early in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I do with this plant,
after it flowers, I just cut it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down to the ground and it will come
back in the summer, thicker and nicer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gives you a nice, thick,
green, kind of bushy kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the artemisias, we've tested,
well, probably not every species of
[SPEAKER_00]: artemisia, but we've tried many of the
artemisias, and they all have been
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, like plants like the tangerine
southern wood, not a particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a place in the garden, but it
doesn't really flower, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even have that light white
color that the other species have up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the deer won't eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the artemisias, like Ludovitiana,
white sage is a very aggressive grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it in your garden,
it's going to spread quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimidiana, it's just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of barely survives the winter
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powis Castle, I love Powis Castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dependable in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those plants that,
in the wintertime, there'll be some damage
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, but rarely will that plant die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just sections of it will die,
and it will come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great plant to give you some of
that fine textures from the foliage,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as that light-colored leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Asclepius, this was one of those
plants that I was just so surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were maybe about 10 years ago sitting
in a friend of ours' backyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a drink or whatever, and he had a
field, just an empty field next to his
[SPEAKER_00]: property, and we could see the deer
walking through the field, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation always goes around deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed that the butterfly weed
was just all over that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, why aren't those deer eating
those butterfly weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried this, and they're resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer won't touch this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very pretty garden ornamental,
just primarily in the orange color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can try the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these belong to that category for
the pollinator gardens, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: butterfly gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the milkweed also, a plant that you
don't see too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it very frequently in
gardens, but you should see more of,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the deer won't touch it,
and they are good for the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalamitha, particularly this white cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you sell this plant, the white
cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a spectacular little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blooms quite a lot, very easy to
propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into propagating your own
plants, you could probably just take a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and throw it in the ground,
and it wouldn't root for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting grower, very
aggressive grower, because it's in that
[SPEAKER_00]: mint family, which are so easy to grow and
so dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try the Kalamithas if you haven't tried
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is one of those plants like
the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be willing to say, without
actually having tested all the carrot
[SPEAKER_00]: species, I would be willing to say that
these are probably all resistant to deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weeping brown sage, it's no wonder,
because the deer probably think it's dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't look like a dead plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the carrots are dependable plants that
the deer stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be occasional nibbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is one of the plants that
they're trying to test to see if they like
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but they usually stay away from this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxglove, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a true biennial, but it, like some of
the other plants, will act as a perennial,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will recede itself and keep
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a garden that you don't mind a
little messiness, this is a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it recedes, it comes up here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the same location every year,
but it looks really nice if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural-looking garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget that there is a yellow
form of the Digitalis, the Foxglove
[SPEAKER_00]: grandiflora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little shorter, has a yellow
flower, and deer stay away from that one
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant that they make Digitoxin
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you take heart medicine,
this is the plant that they make that
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you chew on the leaves, don't chew
on the leaves, but if you did,
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart would do a little palpitations
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Euphorbia is another group of plant that
the deer stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've trialed many kinds, many of the
species of euphorbias, and they seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: all be resistant to the deer, or the deer
stay away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no wonder, you know, a lot of the
euphorbias kind of are toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people say for years that
poinsettias were poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Donkey Tail Spurge, this is one
of my favorite ones, because it does get
[SPEAKER_00]: its flower earlier in the summer with that
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just when you need some color in
the garden, you get that yellow flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all summer long, you get the
blue, green, gray foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a plant, all the euphorbias
really, that you should be aware of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're pruning them,
or taking cuttings, they do produce that
[SPEAKER_00]: sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several people are allergic to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll break out in a skin rash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're out gardening with those,
and you notice that your skin's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: red and itchy, it might be because of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorites, the hellebores,
if you need a plant for deep shade,
[SPEAKER_00]: our Woodland Garden, we have this
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hellebores are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been finding with this plant
that they do set their own seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will, you know, repopulate the
forest with just seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer never touch these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different colors now that are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't tried them,
try these, try these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get them by seedlings, of course,
they're going to take a couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: before they flower, sometimes up to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy them in from plugs,
you're probably looking at two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laney Astrum, this is not one of my 95%
plants, the yellow archangel, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: deer will come around in this very early
spring, and they'll nibble the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually right after they set bud,
so you don't get the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will keep the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cultivar, Herman's Pride,
however, the deer tend to stay away from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more clumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a clumpy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deer don't seem to like that one
as much as the regular true species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why, but that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its cousin, Laneyum, Laneyum and Laney
Astrum, they used to be the same genus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then taxonomists realized that they
were two different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laneyum are even more dependable than the
Laney Astrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely do you see deer eating these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good shade plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does okay in full sun,
but it's mostly a shade plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell just from these
cultivars, you can get a lot of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get a lot of foliage
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have all kinds of cultivars in
your garden and do very nicely with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavenders are one of the very most popular
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deers do stay away from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some lavender fields on the
eastern end of Long Island that people
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and they'll pay $8.50 just to walk
through the lavender field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time of year, they're blooming
and then once the flowers dry out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell the dried flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always complain about this plant
dying in the garden, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember with lavenders, they're one of
the last things to come out in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do get woody stems and people
will, they'll be out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things are going to be grown and
they'll look at the lavender and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the plant is dead, but don't,
you know, just be patient with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably leaf out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the foliage is great in, you know,
the gray green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ligularias, lots of ligularias to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also shade plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you know, they do very
dependably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our garden, we don't have irrigation
other than when I'm out there with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're dry, they'll just go flat,
but they do kind of pop back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting kind of yellowish flowers that
Othello has that orange yellow flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I like that color,
but that's about the only colors that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get with these, with this particular
genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mints, all the mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example where we as humans
eat mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we use them in drinks, like mojito
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the deer won't touch them,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you wish that they kind of ate some
of these plants because they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do grow the mints, you might want
to put them into a pot because once
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in the ground, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Paul mentioned, the daffodils,
all the daffodils are disliked by the deer
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will notice some people say to me,
oh, you know, my daffodils have been
[SPEAKER_00]: nibbled by the deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember when the daffodils are
flowering early summer or late spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it, you know,
there are babies around the baby fawns or
[SPEAKER_00]: they may be extremely hungry after that
winter and they're going to taste those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they find out that they don't
like them, they leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The catnips, the catmints, dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer will stay away from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get beautiful blue flowers in early
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice bushy plants, dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant, very similar to the blue
star that once it's done blooming,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just whack the thing back and it's going
to flower for you a second time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice plant, a little aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This too will recede and come up different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have cats, some nice little
kitty drugs to give to your cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregano, you know, people don't think
about oregano as ornamental too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, right now the oreganos down
in Long Island are flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all kinds of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're whites and pinks and kind of these
purple colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people usually think of oregano
just as a culinary herb, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use when you're making
pizzas or if you're making sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, consider this as an
ornamental in your garden because they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have pretty flowers and they are actually
used as cut flowers by some farm stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pack of sanders are great,
very dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that most people think of is the
pack of sander terminalis, just the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular old traditional pack of sanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheap and does well in shade,
full shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads by rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't forget its cousin, the natural
species, the pack of sander procumbens,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also quite resistant to deer,
dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow anywhere as quickly as
terminalis, but it will add a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat deciduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of semi-deciduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foliage will turn this kind of bronze
purple color in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also it does flower in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not spectacular flowers, but interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just kind of, yeah, stop,
three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten to the woodies yet,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all green husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather have herbaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanies, very good, very dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer stay away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even nibble on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, in the garden,
they're always fun to see come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of very interesting color
addition to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, the peonies,
they do need state to hold up the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're well worth the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parovskis, I don't know how hardy
parovskis are up here, do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, okay, they're hardy up here,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of great color, again,
in the foliage, and then they get the
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty light blue flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another native plant, the may apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it flowers, then it gets the
little fruit on it that some people make
[SPEAKER_00]: jam out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about now, right now in Long
Island, they're mostly dying back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually die before the end of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But deer won't touch these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selvies, this is another culinary herb
that we use a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the sage that we use in stuffing and
soups and all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow it as an herb, but don't
forget that it has a spectacular flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about the same time that the catnips
are flowering, early summer, they get this
[SPEAKER_00]: blue covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're covered with blue flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really hardy plant, dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one that once it's done
blooming, I cut it all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, and then you get this great,
you know, this great gray-green foliage
[SPEAKER_00]: for the summer in that particular
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santalinas, they're both, deer won't eat
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of fun plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these are kinds of plants that if
you're into shaping up little topiaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you have like way too much
free time on your hands, you can do that
[SPEAKER_00]: with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lambs ear are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, another one with this whitish gray
foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have often asked me if we think
that it's because of this white coloration
[SPEAKER_00]: that would keep deer away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does seem to be that there are a
lot of plants that have kind of a whitish
[SPEAKER_00]: gray foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer don't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feverfew, this is a plant that's
everywhere in our gardens, in the shade
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, in the sun garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It recedes itself, and it comes back
dependably every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deer never touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever smelled it, you probably
know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tine, don't forget, you can never have
enough tine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is true with the plant also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the times, again, I haven't tried all
the species of tine, but I'd be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that the deer don't touch these at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periwinkle, it's pretty dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evergreen, a good shade plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's go to the woodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a few woodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budlia, deer don't touch this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know what somebody in this audience
is going to say to me, it's invasive,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on the invasive plant list,
but it's going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budlias come in white and purple and kind
of a blue colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why Noor up there is doing this
breeding work with Vitex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitex is a good replacement for the
Budlia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks almost exactly like it,
except it has these marijuana-like leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not like Budlias.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we try to smoke them,
but it just doesn't do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Noor, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get that kind of marijuana kind
of activity, that might not be so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so Vitex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be hardy up here in
Ithaca, but we noticed that at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantations last year, they planted
several plants and they all lived the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it was a mild winter,
but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is typically a plant for more
warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zone 7, Long Island Zone 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxwoods, we mentioned boxwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul mentioned boxwood earlier,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer won't eat it, but yes, there is that
disease problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Marjorie, there are certain cultivars
that are resistant, right, to the boxwood
[SPEAKER_00]: bite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're... Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the same disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, oh, that's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boxwoods, deer won't touch the
boxwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different cultivars, but we have
several in our own personal garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them just, they are
wonderful-looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get affected by any kind of
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The junipers, a lot of the junipers are
resistant to deer, but I won't say every
[SPEAKER_00]: juniper is, so look on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't enlisted the ones that are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite native plants,
of course, is the bayberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant, it's kind of a deciduous
plant that we grow a lot in Long Island
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's very drought-tolerant and it
also tolerates saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that the bayberry is
dioecious, so you have female plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants, and if you want these pretty
berries, you're gonna have to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tree peony, also,
there's a difference between tree peony
[SPEAKER_00]: and the herbaceous peony.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a woody, and you don't want to
cut this one down in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut this one down in the fall,
you're cutting the stem off and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the flowers off for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tree peony, don't prune that back
to the ground, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, so we should cut it short,
you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I do, before we get to the very
end, I do want to mention that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing this eco, tour in May,
if anybody's interested, see me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 11 days in the Galapagos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this before, and it's the most
wonderful experience of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day we have, in the morning we get
up at six, we leave at six and we hike for
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours on a different island,
and then we snorkel for about three hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then at the end of the day we hike
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not for the faint of heart,
but if you're interested in something that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be one of the most exciting
experiences of your life, please come see
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess we don't really have much
time, but I will be out in the Blue Grass
[SPEAKER_00]: Lane this afternoon if you have questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
