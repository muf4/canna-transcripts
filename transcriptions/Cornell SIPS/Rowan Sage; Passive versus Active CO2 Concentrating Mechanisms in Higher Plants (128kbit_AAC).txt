[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you all for coming
and thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my second trip to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave a seminar in Hort, the old Hort
department, I guess about 10, 12 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't remember for the life of me
what it was on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully it wasn't on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'd like to do today is talk
about some of our work on CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrating mechanisms in higher plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll give a bit on the C4 evolution
story and some of the facets that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: been doing with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also want to talk about some
interesting things we've observed that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going on in C3 plants to give you a nice
sense that they're much more dynamic than
[SPEAKER_04]: we thought in terms of how they manage
photorespiration and deal with the
[SPEAKER_04]: problems it causes and in some ways take
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'll get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an old graph that Ed Tolbert
put together from some years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the bicycle diagram that shows C3
plants C3 photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's useful because it sort of gives a
highlight of the start of our problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the photorespiratory challenge
that plants face.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you're all aware, CO2 here gets
taken up by Robisco and bound to RuBP and
[SPEAKER_04]: carboxylation to produce two PGAs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then using energy in the form of ATP
and NADPH, they're made into sugars and
[SPEAKER_04]: some are regenerated back into RuBP.
[SPEAKER_04]: To maintain the photosynthetic carbon
reduction cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in atmospheres of low CO2 like we've
had in recent millennia, oxygen can be
[SPEAKER_04]: taken up by Robisco and bound to RuBP and
the RuBP oxygenation reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this produces one PG and one PGA and
one two carbon molecule called
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphoglycolate, shown there as PG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the phosphoglycolate has no known use
to the plant and if it accumulates,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant has to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And using energy, they metabolize it back
to PGA but in the process lose previously
[SPEAKER_04]: fixed CO2, which is a bit of a waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because oxygen is taken up and CO2 is
given off, this is called
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now photorespiration has a strong
environmental dependency in that worm
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures and rising CO2 influence the
rate at which it occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're at high CO2, the CO2 suppresses
the oxygenase reaction and
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration relative to
photosynthesis here is quite low,
[SPEAKER_04]: even at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature promotes photorespiration by
promoting the oxygenase over the
[SPEAKER_04]: carboxylation reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at current CO2 levels,
which are now 400 ppm, but correspondingly
[SPEAKER_04]: in the chloroplast, they would be here
where these circles are.
[SPEAKER_04]: As temperature rises, photorespiration can
rise to quite high levels, as you see out
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you close the stomates,
as you would do on a hot, dry condition,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can have photorespiration rates that
can become exceedingly high and
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially exceedingly inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to deal with this, so this just shows
the result of photorespiration on net
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have temperature going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at current atmospheric levels,
or at least a few years ago, at 21%
[SPEAKER_04]: oxygen, a typical C3 photosynthetic
response would be this, with a big drop
[SPEAKER_04]: off at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you reduce photorespiration by
going to 2% oxygen or high CO2,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can see the impact of
photorespiration by comparing the
[SPEAKER_04]: differences in rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see that at high temperatures,
this difference between a photorespiration
[SPEAKER_04]: free and a photorespiration inhibited C3
plant are quite large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not such a problem at large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, because of this strong inhibition,
it's been understood for years that carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrating mechanisms have evolved to
deal with the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the carbon concentrating mechanisms
that would have evolved typically came up
[SPEAKER_04]: in dry environments here, where much of
the C3 flora has been inhibited by the
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration reaction due to the heat
of a desert arid place like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as to model closure to save water
in these conditions, which reduces CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: around the chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Photorespiration is also a serious problem
for much of the C3 flora in places like
[SPEAKER_04]: the tropical rainforest, where high
temperatures that you would often
[SPEAKER_04]: encounter would lead to substantial
oxygenase activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the most famous of the carbon
concentrating mechanisms that have evolved
[SPEAKER_04]: is, of course, C4 photosynthesis,
because a number of C4 plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: important for our food supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And collectively, it provides about a
quarter of the total terrestrial primary
[SPEAKER_04]: productivity on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick review, C4 photosynthesis has
occurred when the reactions of the ribisco
[SPEAKER_04]: and the C3 metabolic cycle are
compartmentalized into the bundle sheath
[SPEAKER_04]: and no longer expressed in the mesophyll
tissue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, in the mesophyll,
you've had the upregulation of the C4
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolic cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which begins when PEP carboxylase takes
PEP, carboxylate it to a four-carbon acid,
[SPEAKER_04]: oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to
maleate in the most common form of C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: That travels to the bundle sheath,
where a decarboxylating enzyme,
[SPEAKER_04]: NAD maleic enzyme, acts upon it to release
CO2, produce NADPH, and then also create a
[SPEAKER_04]: three-carbon residue, pyruvate,
that has to go back and with energy be
[SPEAKER_04]: rephosphorylated to PEP.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with each turn of this cycle,
CO2 gets pumped into this bundle sheath
[SPEAKER_04]: where ribisco is localized, raising CO2 to
levels that suppress photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a key thing I just want to emphasize
here is that energy is required to drive
[SPEAKER_04]: this cycle, so we can think of this as an
actively driven energy-dependent
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon-concentrating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two other well-known carbon-concentrating
mechanisms are CAM photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you see here, which is basically the
C4 type system only instead of spatially
[SPEAKER_04]: separated between a mesophyll and bundle
sheath, it's temporally separated between
[SPEAKER_04]: day and night.
[SPEAKER_04]: At night, the stomate's open, CO2 comes
in, is carboxylated by PEP, C2OAA,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is reduced to maleate that's stored
in the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the day, the stomate's closed,
creating a diffusive barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maleate is released, decarboxylated,
releasing CO2, which builds up to suppress
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration at the ribisco site.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a different group, the algae,
many algae of all a wide variety of forms,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've had the evolution of a bicarbonate
pump, typically where an ATPase pumps
[SPEAKER_04]: protons out, and in a co-transport
mechanism, they bring bicarbonate in,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then in a specialized compartment in
the chloroplast called the pyrolyte,
[SPEAKER_04]: in eukaryotes and the carboxysome in
prokaryotes, the carbonic anhydrase
[SPEAKER_04]: converts the bicarbonate to CO2,
which then builds up to high
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrations around ribisco and suppress
photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now again, I wanna just emphasize,
ATP is needed here, so this bicarbonate
[SPEAKER_04]: pump is an actively driven CCM,
and then in the rebuilding of the
[SPEAKER_04]: carbohydrate pool that will provide the
PEP at night, ATP is needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the CAM system can be considered an
active pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in these active CO2 concentrating
mechanisms, you need the energy to
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate the CO2, the ribisco is
localized to a CO2 enriched region,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you have a resistive barrier to slow
the efflux of CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the C4, the resistive barrier is the
bundle sheath wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the CAM, it's the whole epidermis with
closed stomates, and then in the algae,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a combination of a water layer and
the pyranoid or carboxysome boundary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, there's the examples of these
active systems, and as you probably would,
[SPEAKER_04]: as I've mentioned, raising the CO2 through
this pumping mechanism reduces
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get rid of it, but it reduces
it down to a few percentage points of
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: A second key thing of these CCMs is that
by raising CO2 up to these high levels,
[SPEAKER_04]: they overcome a substrate saturation of
ribisco that's present in the current
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have the carboxylation capacity
corrected for photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we would say have a curve at 30
degrees, this is just the ribisco
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate response to CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the current CO2 level, which you
can see leads to substantial substrate
[SPEAKER_04]: limitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you raise the CO2 level to
what you have in a C4 or a pyranoid,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you begin to approach CO2 saturation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a low CO2 environment, this is a
substantial benefit that plants would have
[SPEAKER_04]: with active CCMs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's a lot of interest these days
in how, when, and why active CCMs have
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with C4, we've been working on this a
bit in the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got onto this when I edited a book,
C4 Plant Biology, in the late 1990s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a nice thing about editing books is
you find out how well the field is really
[SPEAKER_04]: understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with respect to C4, I found out that
when it came to evolutionary questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: things were pretty rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sort of a state of the art at that
time, we thought there were 25 independent
[SPEAKER_04]: lineages.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew they all occurred in advanced
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was speculation that C4 was maybe 10
million years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: The phylogenetic understanding was pretty
poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we knew there were a number of species
that had traits that were intermediate
[SPEAKER_04]: between full C4 and full C3 type species.
[SPEAKER_04]: This phylogeny that Toby Kellogg published
in the book and her chapter sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: summarized it, here we have a phylogeny of
the Carolfilidae class, Caryophyllidae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we just look at Amaranthus here,
which is a group known to have some C4
[SPEAKER_04]: species, you can see that it's not well
distinguished from other group species
[SPEAKER_04]: within the Amaranthaceae-Kenopodiaceae
alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know whether there were C3
species here because it hadn't been fully
[SPEAKER_04]: surveyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't know whether there were
sister groups that might have
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would be true of most of the
groups of clades where we could find C4
[SPEAKER_04]: species being abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really couldn't address
evolutionary issues because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: rudimentary state of the phylogenetics due
to low species coverage, due to an
[SPEAKER_04]: inability to know who were C3 and who were
C4, and then also poor resolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So beginning spurred on by this from the
editing job I did on that book,
[SPEAKER_04]: my coworkers and I, here's Tammy Sage,
one of my coworkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to various herbaria around the
world, Kew, New York Botanical Gardens,
[SPEAKER_04]: Missouri Botanical Gardens, and we went to
the herbarium specimens in these clades
[SPEAKER_04]: where we knew C4 occurred, took little
pieces of samples and measured the carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: isotope ratios, which are easily
distinguished between C3 and C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: So C4s have a carbon isotope ratio of
minus eight to minus 16, C3s are minus 20
[SPEAKER_04]: to minus 32, easily determined with the
mass spec at about $5 an assay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could do thousands of assays,
and so we did thousands of assays on many
[SPEAKER_04]: plant groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we teamed up with phylogenists
from around the world working on these
[SPEAKER_04]: groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thomas Borsch, for example, with the
Amaranthaceae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were able to get them to provide
more detailed analytical phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_04]: assessments of the groups we were
interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we mapped C3 and C4 onto these
phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here's just the Amaranthaceae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by doing this, having a more detailed
phylogeny, because we had something to
[SPEAKER_04]: bring to the table, which is the isotopes,
we then mapped it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the Amaranthaceae you can see
cleanly there's five distinct origins of
[SPEAKER_04]: C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Amaranthus, in Erva, small one in
Tidostromia, a smallish one in
[SPEAKER_04]: Alternanthera, and then a relatively large
one in what we call the gonfanoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: a five genera group gonfina and its
allies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we could go to these branch points
and ask, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have intermediate species?
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we put that intermediacy in a
phylogenetic context?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, here's one that we just published last
year on the group Balephorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a C3 ancestral clade that's in a
sister position to a C4 clade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have this intermediate clade
branching here that, through a preliminary
[SPEAKER_04]: survey of Kranz-type anatomy in the
leaves, looks to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediate states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now, in six weeks, I'm going to
South Africa with my PhD student.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to collect a bunch of
these guys so that we can develop a living
[SPEAKER_04]: evolutionary model of C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, between our efforts and efforts of
others in the field, we've been able to
[SPEAKER_04]: come up with a pretty good map of C4
evolution in the higher plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you see here, there's a cluster in
the grasses, the sedges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And grasses are collectively the granoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cluster in the Caryophyllales
order.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a number of scattered
groups of varying sizes in the
[SPEAKER_04]: angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we go and look carefully,
we can identify over 60 independent
[SPEAKER_04]: lineages of C4 evolution, which is kind of
surprising given that it's a fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: complex trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, with this ability to use the
phylogenies, we can also go and use a
[SPEAKER_04]: molecular clock approach to estimate when
C4 evolved in these distinct lineages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my colleague Pascal Christian did this
in a paper that he published for grasses
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2008.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we published for grasses and
eudicots in 2011, which is summarized in
[SPEAKER_04]: my annual review here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this shows the spread between the stem
node and the crown node with the midpoint
[SPEAKER_04]: there for 46 lineages of grasses and
eudicots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see that beginning about 30
million years ago based on molecular clock
[SPEAKER_04]: approaches, the C4 lineages diverged from
ancestral C3 lineages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you come forward in time over the
past 50 million years, you get more and
[SPEAKER_04]: more lineages appearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we can link this up with changes in
Earth's climate and atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at atmospheric CO2 content
shown here, this beginning here correlates
[SPEAKER_04]: with a drop in atmospheric CO2 down
towards levels similar to today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And consistently, geological studies have
shown C4 isotopes and fossils and then
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence of big expansion of C4 grasslands
and other ecosystems in the subsequent 20
[SPEAKER_04]: to 30 million year period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, recently, what I wanted to do is look
at this in a little more detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the next graphs, I'm going to show
you responses related to the midpoint
[SPEAKER_04]: between stem and crown nodes in these
projected dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did is I went and was able to
estimate the number of species for each of
[SPEAKER_04]: the projected C4 lineages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we can estimate the time origins
for 52 lineages, which are shown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you can see is that using the
midpoint just to keep the graph kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: clean, here's the range between crown and
stem nodes, for the 52 of the 60 lineages,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see that the older lineages are
the ones that have become the most
[SPEAKER_04]: speciose, with three grass lineages,
chloroidoids, andropulganate, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: malindae group being the most speciose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The eudicots, which tend to be about as
old as the grasses, the older ones are
[SPEAKER_04]: more speciose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you come down to the younger
groups, such you find that in grasses in
[SPEAKER_04]: the red triangles, eudicots in the black
circles, and sedges in the blue symbols,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the last 5 to 10 million years,
all the groups are fairly small in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of species number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can look at when these
lineages occurred, just the number of
[SPEAKER_04]: lineages as a function of the last 30
million years, starting here 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_04]: million years ago, and then a burst of
evolutionary diversification in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 million years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is a recent CO2 graph.
[SPEAKER_04]: With oxygen isotope data that gives a
climate proxy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just focus on CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a paper out of Mark Pagani's group
at Yale that used a number of proxies to
[SPEAKER_04]: estimate CO2 levels over the last 40
million years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are today, 40 million years ago,
and at the time, 40 to 30 million years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, CO2 levels are projected to be high
by a number of complementary proxies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the late oligocene,
about 25 million years ago, the CO2 level
[SPEAKER_04]: drops down, a little bit of a drop here,
and then over the last 15 million years,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been about what it was in recent
geological time with a drop down to below
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 ppm in the last ice age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now putting on this graph from the
previous panel I showed you to just allow
[SPEAKER_04]: you to look at CO2 versus C4 evolutionary
diversification, you see in these higher
[SPEAKER_04]: CO2 periods, a few groups diverged,
and then in the low CO2 periods of the
[SPEAKER_04]: last 20 million years is when most of them
diverged, and then if you look right after
[SPEAKER_04]: this little drop from about 500 to
somewhere around 400 ppm, that's where you
[SPEAKER_04]: get the greatest level of divergence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that looks like changes in atmospheric
CO2 were one of the drivers, or perhaps
[SPEAKER_04]: you will, preconditions for evolutionary
diversification of C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've been working on how C4 evolved,
and beginning with work by Russ Monson and
[SPEAKER_04]: the genus Flavaria and continuing with
many other groups, I picked up on this in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last 15 years, and we've come up with
a conceptual model for how you can build a
[SPEAKER_04]: C4 plant, and it basically follows as I'll
explain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from an ancestral C3 condition,
you have anatomical preconditioning,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we suspect might be things such as
closed vein spacing, high genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: duplication, and then we propose that you
have enlargement of bundle sheath cells
[SPEAKER_04]: with more organelles in the bundle sheath
cells so that the bundle sheath becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: physiologically engaged and activated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have mitochondria for some
reason moving to the inner bundle sheath
[SPEAKER_04]: wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And together, at this stage, you get what
we call the proto-Kranz condition,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you see hints of Kranz anatomy
starting in these otherwise C3 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get a key mutation where you
lose glycine decarboxylase expression in
[SPEAKER_04]: the mesophyll, and it's only expressed in
the bundle sheath cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And associated with mitochondrial
enlargement and further elaboration of
[SPEAKER_04]: mesophyll to bundle sheath ratios,
you get what's called a photorespiratory
[SPEAKER_04]: C3.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to pump, or a condition we call
C2 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once this is established, you get
upregulation of the C4 cycle, which then
[SPEAKER_04]: leads to full C4 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I want to do now is to show you
some of the evidence we have from two
[SPEAKER_04]: groups, heliotropium and nerafni.
[SPEAKER_04]: One's a eudicot, one's a grass,
for this particular model.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so before I begin, I want to just go
over photorespiration a little bit so some
[SPEAKER_04]: of this might make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the photorespiratory pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phosphoglycolate, made by the oxygenation
of our UVP, is converted to glycine in the
[SPEAKER_04]: peroxisome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This goes to the mitochondria,
where an enzyme glycine decarboxylase acts
[SPEAKER_04]: upon it, releasing CO2 and serine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the serine is made back to PGA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CO2 presumably is able to escape
from the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, now this CO2, under high
photorespiratory conditions, actually can
[SPEAKER_04]: be viewed as a resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the plant can compartmentalize the
release of this GDC, it can actually set
[SPEAKER_04]: up a condition where this CO2 can drive
improved photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Russ Monson proposed some years ago
that you get a special specialization of
[SPEAKER_04]: the photorespiratory pathway into two cell
types, the mesophyll and bundle sheath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this simply happens when you lose GDC
expression in mesophyll mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have enough mitochondria in the
bundle sheath, which you can have in a
[SPEAKER_04]: physiologically activated bundle sheath,
then the photorespiratory glycine that's
[SPEAKER_04]: produced will have to flow from the
mesophyll, which is much more voluminous,
[SPEAKER_04]: into the bundle sheath cells, where it can
be acted upon by GDC to release CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any chloroplasts, then, that are
nearby can take this CO2 and assimilate it
[SPEAKER_04]: at a much higher efficiency than would
occur out in the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would, in essence, then,
get a CO2 concentrating mechanism formed
[SPEAKER_04]: simply by the relocalization of GDC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went into heliotropium section
orthostakis, which Mike Froehlich had
[SPEAKER_04]: identified as having C3, C4, and C3,
C4 intermediate species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And taking leaf samples, we characterized
their anatomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We developed a phylogeny, which is shown
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we looked at some of the
physiological, and more recently,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the molecular traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the species we collected are the
heliotropium calcicola and tinellum here
[SPEAKER_04]: at the base of the orthostakis clade.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got heliotropium corwinza.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got musciae and procumbens here further
up the clade.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a C4, heliotropium taxanum,
and then these two intermediates,
[SPEAKER_04]: convolvulaceum and gregieae.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see a sense of phylogenetic
progression from a distal to a more,
[SPEAKER_04]: or from a basal to a more distal series of
branches, with C4 being acquired in the
[SPEAKER_04]: more distal branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here is the anatomical progression
that we see as we move from a more basal
[SPEAKER_04]: to a more distal position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is typically C3, small bundle
sheath cells without many organelles.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this heliotropium tinellum,
you begin to see inflation of the bundle
[SPEAKER_04]: sheath cells, but not many organelles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heliotropium corwinskiae, you begin to see
sort of a rounding out of the bundle
[SPEAKER_04]: sheath cells into something that's sort of
looking like preliminary first phase trans
[SPEAKER_04]: anatomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's heliotropium procumbens with
pronounced but smallish bundle sheath
[SPEAKER_04]: cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are in the intermediate
heliotropium convolvulaceum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can clearly see a bundle sheath
vascular patterning becoming more
[SPEAKER_04]: pronounced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the intermediate heliotropium
gregieae, it begins to look almost C4-like
[SPEAKER_04]: with big bundle sheaths.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here are your C4s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the data compiled from this shows
that the mesophyll tissues drop off in
[SPEAKER_04]: their percentage of the leaf
cross-sections in the C4s, but not so much
[SPEAKER_04]: in the C3s or intermediates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the big change is a buildup of bundle
sheath volume as you go along this
[SPEAKER_04]: phylogenetic gradient from the basal to
the more distal C3s and then into the
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediates in the C4s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is seen also as a reduction in
mesophyll to bundle sheath ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vein density doesn't change because the
C3s start out with a high vein density
[SPEAKER_04]: that's similar to the C4s, which might be
a preconditioning trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we look at organelle levels in these
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we see organelles per bundle sheath
cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is for the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is looking at the position
of those organelles, the percent of
[SPEAKER_04]: organelles in the inner bundle sheath
going from the basal species in that
[SPEAKER_04]: clade, the C3-ish guys, into the
intermediates, and then finally the C4s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't really see any C3
progression in chloroplast numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The intermediates have much higher
chloroplast numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The C4s have variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has few chloroplasts, but they're
gigantic.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mitochondria in the C3s you see
relatively low here, but in the bundle
[SPEAKER_04]: sheath of Heliotropium corwinskii we see a
significantly enhanced number of
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get to be quite high in the
intermediates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the positioning, though, shows a
dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we go up the phylogeny towards the more
distal branches, you see a progressive
[SPEAKER_04]: shift of chloroplast positioning from the
outer half to the inner half, such that by
[SPEAKER_04]: the time you're in the intermediates,
most of the chloroplasts are on the
[SPEAKER_04]: inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mitochondria seem to show the same
shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's one C3, a second C3,
and a third C3 species as you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: from basal to the node that's sister to
the intermediate and C4 branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at glycine decarboxylase
localization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the C3.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of these brown spots is where you
have staining for glycine decarboxylase in
[SPEAKER_04]: the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would reflect a mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see in Heliotropium tinellum,
the basal C3, it's scattered throughout
[SPEAKER_04]: the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heliotropium corwinskii, which is a few
nodes more distal towards the C4 clades,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see the glycine decarboxylase is
scattered throughout the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you see this characteristic or this
interesting banding right around the inner
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the bundle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heliotropium procumbens, you see that
banding a little more strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is physiologically a C3 species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get into the intermediates,
you see no decarboxylase expression out in
[SPEAKER_04]: the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all concentrated into the bundle
sheath, especially along the inner half of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cell lining the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's another view in Heliotropium
gregii, a C3, C4 intermediate,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Heliotropium taxanum, shows a typical
C4 pattern where GDC is restricted to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bundle sheath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I wanted to look at what's going on in
corwinskii, a C3 species physiologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you see this vasculature,
which is larger and more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not huge by C4 standards,
but it's big by C3 standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the GDC stain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see there's a lot of GDC staining
along the inner part of the bundle sheath
[SPEAKER_04]: cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the GDC out in the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we looked at the transmission electron
micrograph at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's very few mitochondria visible
in this outer part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, they have lined up onto this
inner part here, where they are associated
[SPEAKER_04]: with a few chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had, in this C3 species that's
sister to the intermediates, a
[SPEAKER_04]: polarization of mitochondrial
distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now when we go to the full C3,
C4 intermediate Heliotropium
[SPEAKER_04]: convolvulaceum, a very fairly pronounced
bundle sheath enlargement, very pronounced
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC localization to the inner part of the
bundle sheath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at it at the TEM,
we see a very high number of mitochondria
[SPEAKER_04]: here, here, here, and this cap of
chloroplast layering over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is along this inner part of the
bundle sheath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another view here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this then is the classic C3,
C4 intermediate anatomy and physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea is that photorespiratory
glycine formed out in the mesophyll has to
[SPEAKER_04]: travel to these layer of mitochondria here
to be metabolized and release CO2,
[SPEAKER_04]: which these chloroplasts can scarf up with
high efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a diagram of this mechanism
where photorespiration produces glycolate,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is made into glycine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes into these mitochondria because
mitochondria out in the mesophyll have no
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mitochondria in the bundle sheath have the
GDC.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CO2 is released upon metabolism of
this glycine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Serine goes back to complete the
photorespiratory cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: This CO2 builds up to about three times,
maybe four times what otherwise would be
[SPEAKER_04]: allowing these chloroplasts to operate at
high efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the effect of this on photosynthesis
is visible here.
[SPEAKER_04]: C3 photosynthesis, and that photosynthesis
is a function of intracellular CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the C3s, you have a high CO2
compensation point, a shallower slope than
[SPEAKER_04]: you would in a C4, a slowly saturating
response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the C2 type, this is based on C2,
or this is based on Heliotropium,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have a reduction in CO2 compensation
point, slightly bigger initial slope,
[SPEAKER_04]: and an overall improved photosynthetic
performance below CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I switched into talking about C2,
photosynthesis, and this is a term that I
[SPEAKER_04]: coined to try and come up with something
that physiologically describes this
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolism separate from the term C3,
C4 intermediacy, which had been used
[SPEAKER_04]: previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it refers to the two carbons in this
glycine molecule that shuttle CO2 into
[SPEAKER_04]: this internal compartment of the bundle
sheath in a similar manner as the four
[SPEAKER_04]: carbons in malate that shuttle CO2 into
the bundle sheath in C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I came up with this is
because we were running into confusion
[SPEAKER_04]: between what is a C3, C4 intermediate
trait and what would be a physiology that
[SPEAKER_04]: could exist in a much wider range of
plants than those that are evolving
[SPEAKER_04]: towards C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, just quickly, another group,
the Narakane we've been studying,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this has C3 and C4 intermediates and
C4 species.
[SPEAKER_04]: We collected eight in the wilds of
Australia in sites like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the intermediate species,
Narakane minor, growing in a pot,
[SPEAKER_04]: a rocky pothole that's been formed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I just want to show you bundle
sheath and mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually a specialized layer
called the mesotome sheath.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not anatomically proper bundle
sheath, but it's a vascular sheath layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to look at the mitochondria per
cell, GDC per mitochondria, based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: number of gold particles appearing in an
immunoblot stain, and the GDC per cell
[SPEAKER_04]: area, which is GDC per mitochondria times
the number of mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm expressing this as a function of
CO2 compensation point, where C3 values
[SPEAKER_04]: are high right here and C4 values are the
zero ones right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in the bundle sheath, we see the
number of mitochondria per cell going up
[SPEAKER_04]: as we go to lower CO2 compensation points,
and then it comes down into the C4.
[SPEAKER_04]: The GDC per mito goes up as we go to lower
CO2 compensation points, and
[SPEAKER_04]: correspondingly in the mesophyll,
the GDC levels come down in a progression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the number of gold particles per
cell area, which is a function of mitos
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on, you see going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're getting a lot more GDC in the
sheath cells and a bit less out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're seeing a similar pattern to what
we see in heliotropium in this grass group
[SPEAKER_04]: of gradual enhancement of GDC in the
sheath cells while the mesophyll
[SPEAKER_04]: expression goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, through the taxonomic or the
phylogenetic work and the isotope work,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've now identified a dozen independent
lineages where the C3, C4 intermediate
[SPEAKER_04]: condition is sister to the C4 condition
using this pattern of C2 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've also identified four clades with
no evolutionary relationship between C4
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthesis and the expression of this
C2 photosynthesis type metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here we have this again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I want to emphasize, and I got to
thinking about this and thinking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that this metabolism does not
necessarily have to be associated with C4
[SPEAKER_04]: evolution, that it could operate as a bona
fide carbon concentrating mechanism in its
[SPEAKER_04]: own right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a key thing about this is no
additional ATP expenditure is required.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a buildup of glycine from high
photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by a strategic relocalization of GDC
into this one compartment where
[SPEAKER_04]: chloroplast can be enhanced, you can
affect CO2 concentration without spending
[SPEAKER_04]: any extra energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have then a passive CO2
concentrating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of interesting to think that
in the case of C4 evolution, the evolution
[SPEAKER_04]: of this passive mechanism to scavenge
photorespired CO2 laid the foundation or
[SPEAKER_04]: built the bridge, if you will,
to the C4 condition by setting up this
[SPEAKER_04]: structural mesophyll to bundle sheath
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And upon this, you could then layer on the
active C4 metabolic cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this pyramid diagram just shows the
diversity of photosynthetic CCMs in
[SPEAKER_04]: organic pumping of bicarbonate,
CAMC4, and now the C2 passive type.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it got me to thinking, what might be
going on in the C3s?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they playing with photorespiratory CO2
to enhance rubisco efficiency?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we decided to go and look for
passive CCM-type conditions in the C3
[SPEAKER_04]: flora.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to begin with rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we went and looked at rice mesophyll
cells as part of the C4 engineering
[SPEAKER_04]: project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that struck me about
these in this longitudinal section here is
[SPEAKER_04]: the chloroplast formed this dense layer
around the periphery of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you see a nice view of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mitochondria here, here,
here, here, are all positioned to the
[SPEAKER_04]: interior of this chloroplast layer,
which is quite thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where you have gaps between
chloroplasts, as right here, you get these
[SPEAKER_04]: extensions forming where the chloroplast
blebs out to form a seal between the two
[SPEAKER_04]: of them and block off direct efflux roots
out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we see transverse sections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see there's a chloroplast in these
lobed protrusions of the mesophyll cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's mitochondria to the inner part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's these extensions, what we call
stromal extensions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's some high mags of the
extensions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you see an extension sealing off a
gap between two chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a bunch of mitochondria sandwiched
between the chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a case where the chloroplast has
actually been enveloped by these
[SPEAKER_04]: chloroplast extensions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's another case there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this got us to thinking what could
possibly be going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did an immunogold blot for Robisco and
found that in these extensions,
[SPEAKER_04]: or stromials, you have Robisco present.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a mitochondria that's blocked off
from the periphery of the cell by this
[SPEAKER_04]: stromial extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we then redrew the typical
appearance of a C3 leaf to create
[SPEAKER_04]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Layered on the photorespiratory cycle,
here oxygen is being taken up,
[SPEAKER_04]: carboxylating RuBP to form
phosphoglycolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The glycine then is metabolized by GDC in
the right hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the glycine is released into this
internal space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way out is through a
chloroplast or the stromial extension,
[SPEAKER_04]: which gives Robisco a chance to capture
and refix this CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And under high photorespiratory
conditions, this surge of CO2 produced
[SPEAKER_04]: could potentially enhance the amount of
CO2 in the chloroplasts and improve
[SPEAKER_04]: Robisco efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to test this, I formed a collaboration
with Tammy Sage, my faculty colleague,
[SPEAKER_04]: ace of cousins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Florian Bush is my post-doc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a paper published in PC&E a few
years ago, we presented the results of our
[SPEAKER_04]: study.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what we wanted to do is to measure
directly the amount of fixation of
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespired and respired CO2 by
chloroplasts before it can leave the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: To do this, we used a pulse chase system
with carbon-13, where we first loaded the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves with carbon-12.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we all of a sudden switched them
to carbon-13, a pure carbon-13 CO2 source.
[SPEAKER_04]: So assimilation of carbon-13 measured by a
mass spec would give us photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_04]: this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'd be able to measure the
respiration signal by the carbon-12 coming
[SPEAKER_04]: off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the carbon-12 that was refixed here
would presumably be coming from these
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through a series of mathematical
calculations, we were able to estimate a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did the measurements at 350 ppm and
30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in rice, which has chloroplast
coverage of the mesophyll of 99%,
[SPEAKER_04]: so 99% of the mesophyll exposed to
intercellular spaces is covered by
[SPEAKER_04]: chloroplasts, we measured the total
re-assimilation of photorespired and
[SPEAKER_04]: respired CO2 was about 51%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 29% of that was coming from CO2 that
was directly re-assimilated from
[SPEAKER_04]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we modeled then that the increase in
chloroplasts CO2 due to this was 14 ppm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this led to an 11% enhancement of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we repeated the measurements at 200
ppm, which was the CO2 level 20,000 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here the total re-assimilation was
estimated at 59% of respired and
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespired CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Intrasalular re-assimilation was 38%.
[SPEAKER_04]: We estimated that the CO2 concentration
inside was enhanced by 16 parts per
[SPEAKER_04]: million from this photorespired CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that boosted photosynthesis by 33%
over what it otherwise would have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at these low CO2 conditions,
this level of enhancement is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to become substantial.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the same for wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wheat also forms these stromules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a mitochondria and there's two
stromules.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the view you would get if you were
looking at the wheat cell standing face
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the high coverage of
chloroplasts with only a few gaps between
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this effectively forms a cage that
will force photorespired CO2 through the
[SPEAKER_04]: chloroplasts as it's diffusing from the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the outside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just did these measurements at 350
ppm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we estimated that the CO2
concentration in the chloroplasts from
[SPEAKER_04]: this photorespired CO2 being forced to
leave through the chloroplasts was 14 ppm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have an 11% enhancement of
photosynthesis as a result.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we call this refixation of
photorespired CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a question is, how widespread is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go, for example, into the C3
flora of the Mojave Desert or say the
[SPEAKER_04]: subtropical Australian woodland,
how many of these species would have
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved a mechanism to trap and refix this
photorespired CO2 and thus compensate for
[SPEAKER_04]: the hot, dry conditions that you would
have in these kinds of environments?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the things we want to do in
coming years is actually screen wild
[SPEAKER_04]: populations in these environments prone to
photorespiration for this kind of anatomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it raises a paradox of the modern
biosphere, which is the CO2 concentration
[SPEAKER_04]: in the recent atmosphere was quite low.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got down to 180 ppm 20,000 years ago,
which in the tropics would cause high
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It averaged around 230, 240 ppm throughout
the ice age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on ice core records.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these conditions would be strongly
inhibitory because of increased
[SPEAKER_04]: photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had C4 plants out there who would have
provided very strong competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet despite all of this, 90% of the earth
plant species are C3.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the C3 plants occur in the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the low latitude biomes are
dominated by C3s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And C4 is actually rare in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're an absent in most life forms such
as trees and vines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So although C4s do well in certain
situations like grasslands, they are not
[SPEAKER_04]: the dominant vegetation of the warm parts
of the planet even in these very low CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're wondering whether recycling a
photorespired CO2 is a way to offset or
[SPEAKER_04]: compensate for these low CO2 conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we've come up with the term passive
CO2 concentration to describe the C2
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthetic system that can lead to C4
or can exist independent of any C4
[SPEAKER_04]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've described some of the criteria
that would fit a passive CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So CO2 around some Robisco is enhanced by
strategic placement of mitochondrial CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: assimilation or CO2 emission.
[SPEAKER_04]: No extra energy is required, hence the
passive aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a resistive barrier to slow the
efflux of mitochondrial CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Robisco needs to have specifically
enhanced CO2 and photosynthesis in these
[SPEAKER_04]: regions where the photorespired CO2 is
being released.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this system is specifically
selected for by natural selection,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could argue that it's a bona fide
adaptive feature in and of its own right
[SPEAKER_04]: and, of course, if it enhances carbon gain
and fitness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've described C2 photosynthesis,
but we're arguing that this mechanism seen
[SPEAKER_04]: in rice and its allies here is also a
passive CO2 concentrating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a huge impact, but especially at
low CO2, it's a significant impact that
[SPEAKER_04]: could maybe enhance plant fitness enough
to offset the potential for, say,
[SPEAKER_04]: out competition by C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when we think about passive CO2
systems, we've got to move and think
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond just photorespiration, but also
respiratory CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where you get thick respiratory CO2
tissues such as stems or fruits,
[SPEAKER_04]: then by putting a barrier in place,
you can actually have a passive CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have the stem of a birch,
and you have this particular sclerotic
[SPEAKER_04]: layer, the sclerenchyma layer,
in the outer part of the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the phloem parenchyma, and the
chloroplasts in the phloem parenchyma are
[SPEAKER_04]: auto fluorescing, showing that they're
fairly potentially physiologically active.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respiratory CO2 produced in this stem
could diffuse out but get held up by this
[SPEAKER_04]: sclerenchyma layer and potentially build
up to a point where photosynthesis in this
[SPEAKER_04]: phloem layer and maybe down here in the
pith layer is enhanced so that rubisco can
[SPEAKER_04]: operate very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: In salaginella, you have a condition where
a thick cortical layer could provide a
[SPEAKER_04]: resistive barrier, and then you have these
lacunae that form and diffuse up from
[SPEAKER_04]: below ground tissues bringing respired CO2
with them, and by lining these below
[SPEAKER_04]: ground, or these lacunae from below ground
with chloroplasts, the CO2 that's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: up from below ground from roots and tuber
rhizomes and even soil-respired CO2 could
[SPEAKER_04]: allow these chloroplasts to operate with
high levels of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these may fit the criteria of a passive
CCM, and it would be worth going back and
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at many of these species to see if
these are specific adaptations to improve
[SPEAKER_04]: the carbon balance of these plants in
geological times of low CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if that's it, just a quick thanks
to my funder, NSERC, my various postdocs
[SPEAKER_04]: and grad students who have worked with me
on the project, Pascal Christian,
[SPEAKER_04]: who we collaborated with on a lot of the
phylogenetics, and with that I'll take
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the obvious question is why don't
all CCM plants do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: They may.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do which of these?
[SPEAKER_04]: The traffic measures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That rice does.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've looked at half a dozen crop species
and they all do it to some degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them don't do it as much as rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice and wheat stand out in having a very
high chloroplast number so you get that
[SPEAKER_04]: complete sheath around the periphery.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's expensive in terms of nitrogen and
other things, and when you go to low
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen, you see the chloroplast becoming
fewer in number and they spread apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaps form between them and then you see
the refixation potential going way down as
[SPEAKER_04]: CO2 presumably leaks out much more
readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a cost associated with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things you see in the C3
plants is the chloroplasts tend to be very
[SPEAKER_04]: thin and pushed up against the periphery,
indicating that evolution is made for
[SPEAKER_04]: these small, thin chloroplasts,
but a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go to the sea forest,
for example, you don't have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have fewer chloroplasts and many of
them are much bigger because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have photo respiration occurring out in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't have this evolutionary
imperative to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most seem to have the ability to do this
if they have enough nitrogen to build
[SPEAKER_04]: enough chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because temperature affects the CO2 and
oxygen solubility, do you see,
[SPEAKER_03]: with increasing temperature among the C3
species, a greater propensity of CO2
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrated?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the CO2 concentrating mechanisms and
all those clades that I showed you are
[SPEAKER_04]: very high temperature climate plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you go to lower temperatures,
then you see less of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see any of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the C2 mechanism that we see,
all those groups listed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think, let me see if I got a
picture of one of these guys growing in
[SPEAKER_04]: its natural habitat.
[SPEAKER_04]: There.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the natural habitat for C2.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Mojave Desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surface temperature here during the
growing season is 65 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves are working around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts off at 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the middle of the day, it's approaching
50.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is its growing season, and it's
supported by monsoon rains that provide
[SPEAKER_04]: summer moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this condition, especially at 300 or
280 ppm, the pre-industrial CO2,
[SPEAKER_04]: although that would be really high photo
respiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a big slug of CO2, which on the
one hand, you could just let it go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or on the other hand, by strategically
placing your GDC, then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a great resource to exploit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So following up on that a little bit,
I buy that C2 is a precursor for whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: is C4.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why is C2 maintained?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see environmental segregation
between C2s and C4s?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have expected everybody that's
in that kind of environment to eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: evolve towards a C4, and C2 would no
longer be next dance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everybody in this kind of
environment C3s do do well, but they may
[SPEAKER_04]: be doing well because they're kind of
sitting still and it's this hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use early morning hours and close
their stomachs and sleep through the
[SPEAKER_04]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take a siesta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they may be operative off season during
the winter or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do see a lot of the C3 flora,
such as some of these guys, just shutting
[SPEAKER_04]: down when it's this hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are C4s in that same
environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: These grasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's C4s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one of the things about these C2s is
they tend to occur in these oddball
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, or they tend to occur as
weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, the one that occurs around
here is a mulugo vericillata, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: called carpetweed, and it grows on
people's patios and lawns in July and
[SPEAKER_04]: August.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fugitive species, so it sort of
escapes competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: By growing in these opportunistic but hot
sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a blacktop in your driveway
and you don't pull your weeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to get carpetweed growing in
Cornell in this kind of otherwise moist
[SPEAKER_04]: climate, but it's a very hot microsite on
that blacktop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, these guys grow on these very
extreme sand dunes, rocky surfaces,
[SPEAKER_04]: gypsum surfaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they grow where there's low competition
due to extreme or recent disturbance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're kind of escapists.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we think that is because once
C4 evolves, as the gas exchange diagram I
[SPEAKER_04]: showed you, it's superior and it just
excludes these guys out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not strong competitors,
whereas the C4s are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great, fascinating work that's
been done in the elucidation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomical evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't mention much about
tetravoxylases versus hibisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wondered, if you just said a word
about the pepcarboxylase, where that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: into the history, whether there were other
avenues of evolution in pepcarboxylase
[SPEAKER_00]: analogs, and also kind of related to that,
could there be some reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: pepcarboxylase is a challenging enzyme
either to evolve or simply for a plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain that reduces the prevalence of
C4?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so pepcarboxylase is, the problem
is, it has in the existing C3 metabolism
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it doesn't lead to net CO2
fixation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a gateway into the Krebs cycle,
but the carbon it produces, OAA,
[SPEAKER_04]: a Krebs cycle intermediate, and then
maleate, to run it through the Krebs
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle, you're gonna have to get off that
CO2 fix during Krebs cycle metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't get net fixation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually serves as sort of a gateway in
and out of the Krebs cycle and in and out
[SPEAKER_04]: of, the fatty acid metabolism and other
things that meet the Krebs cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to re-engineer pepcarboxylase to fit
into a net CO2 fixation loop, you may have
[SPEAKER_04]: to go and screw up the Krebs cycle
metabolism, which would be a pretty big
[SPEAKER_04]: deal and challenging for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pepsiease itself is quite ubiquitous in
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's used in many physiological functions,
and it's there in all of the land plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using it, is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to upregulate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to couple it with something
that leads to net CO2 fixation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, only carboxylase in eukaryotes
that we know does that is resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe if we wanted to get into
synthetic biology and genetically engineer
[SPEAKER_04]: a completely new photosynthetic thing,
we could pull a bacterial enzyme out,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bacterial carboxylase, and then put in
some things and create a new fixation
[SPEAKER_04]: scheme, and that's been discussed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But technologically, we're not quite
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's something we actually want to
go to all of these intermediate guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got most of these in collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of them only have a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't really get an evolutionary
progression because you only got one or
[SPEAKER_04]: two intermediate stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and most of them seem to fix on that
pure C2 metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exception is one area here with nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then this one blepharis that I
mentioned that we just did the phylogeny
[SPEAKER_04]: on, it could have up to 30 intermediates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on a preliminary screen with the
variant material, it looks like there's
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit of variation in this
intermediate series of traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you can go in and look at
when, along this so-called evolutionary
[SPEAKER_04]: progression, you get step changes or
gradual changes in the buildup of plasma
[SPEAKER_04]: that's modded, or changes in mesophil
chloroplasts, which we've done for
[SPEAKER_04]: plevaria.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at where this change in mesophil
chloroplast number occurs, and it seemed
[SPEAKER_04]: to occur progressively.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just coming out now in plant cell
physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we can do that kind of thing,
but we need to have various specious
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediate groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any last question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among all these phylogenetic studies in
particular, do you see any evidence that
[SPEAKER_01]: C4 breaks down and falls back to the C2 as
possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: Regress?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a few minor things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Allotoropsis has pretty good evidence for
a reversion.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably a reversion in I can't
think, in the caesuvioid group in the,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is in, oh, I forget the name of this
family now, but there's good evidence for
[SPEAKER_04]: reversion there in a group called
caesuvium, the genus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's possibilities in the Kena
podiaceae that you've had loss,
[SPEAKER_04]: diversification of the reconstituted C3,
and then reacquisition of C4 from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is that a real loss and reacquisition,
or is that multiple evolutionary events?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need much finer phylogenetic detail
to be able to address those hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of the priorities for
coming years, is to go into these groups
[SPEAKER_04]: that look to be fairly dynamic and see
whether they're dynamic or whether you've
[SPEAKER_04]: just got multiple C4s spinning off of some
predisposed C3 ancestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid we have to stop the discussion
for the same goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
