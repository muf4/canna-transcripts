[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I'm Chuck Nicholson, and I'm
affiliated with the horticultural section
[SPEAKER_00]: of the School of Integrative Plant Science
at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a number of industry meetings recently,
there's been discussion about the role
[SPEAKER_00]: that controlled environment agriculture,
production technologies like greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical farms, and plant factories could
play in meeting or improving food
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this short presentation walks us
through some of the basic definitions of
[SPEAKER_00]: food security and has us think a little
bit more carefully about the role that
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment agriculture might
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this being discussed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the reasons why people talk
about a linkage between controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment agriculture and food security
is the incredible potential to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yields through greenhouses and vertical
farms compared to soil-based or land-based
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, controlled environment
agriculture is much less susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: variations in climate, in rainfall,
and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is this focus on the ability to
increase production and do it in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable way that has been a focal point for
discussions about how this might
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, Per Pinstrup-Anderson,
the former director general of the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Food Policy Research
Institute and a winner of the World Food
[SPEAKER_00]: Prize, wrote an article in Global Food
Security talking about this exact issue
[SPEAKER_00]: and claimed that it was time for us to
begin to take vertical indoor farming
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously as a way to address food
security issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he cited essentially two components.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the growing demand, and the other
was the need for more resilient production
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that were less susceptible to
climate and had lower water needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a growing demand and a shift in
food consumption from staples like grain
[SPEAKER_00]: grains and starches to meat, fruit,
and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be increased demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we have a number of
major micronutrient deficiencies that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be helped by increased fruit and
vegetable consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that are about the
demand side and the need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the production side is really
about these controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture systems having lower weather
and pest risks than open field production
[SPEAKER_00]: and using less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many locations, water scarcity is
becoming more and more an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order for us to think a little bit
more carefully about food security and its
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to controlled environment
agriculture, we need to think more
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully about how food security or food
insecurity are defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do these definitions align with
the potential contributions from
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment ag systems,
including these higher yields and more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a common place for people to refer to
information about food security on a
[SPEAKER_00]: global scale is this report that comes out
annually in the State of Food Security and
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrition in the World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And related to that, there has long since
been a definition put out by the Committee
[SPEAKER_00]: on World Food Security, a part of the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations, that says food security is when
all people at all times have physical,
[SPEAKER_00]: social and economic access to food which
is safe and consumed in sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity and quality to meet their dietary
needs and food preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part that's about food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go on to say, and is
supported by an environment of adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation, health services and care,
allowing for a healthy and active life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So immediately, there's nothing here that
says anything about fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that says anything about
controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, one of the things that
this is focusing on really is the social
[SPEAKER_00]: economic access, as well as the physical
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to ask ourselves whether
controlled environment agriculture can
[SPEAKER_00]: really affect the access outcomes that are
vitally important for meeting this
[SPEAKER_00]: definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a broader sense, there are multiple
components of food security that are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diagram from a 2013 paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Andy Jones at the University of
Michigan and some co-authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do talk about food availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially how much food is
produced and available for consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally at a regional or country scale,
not at the level of an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: household.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as in the previous definition,
there's important role for access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilization is really whether or not the
body has the health conditions to allow it
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the nutrients that have been
provided in food consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then across all of that is the need
for this to be a continuous condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, stability implies that the
availability conditions, the access
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and the utilization conditions
are all met over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a much broader definition
associated with food security than is
[SPEAKER_00]: anything directly to do with controlled
environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, the organization
that defines food security or food
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurity is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture, in part for
some of their assistance programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they define it essentially as a lack
of consistent access to enough food for an
[SPEAKER_00]: active, healthy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go on to say that this is really
related to a lack of financial resources
[SPEAKER_00]: for food at the household level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the issue is more about access
and affordability rather than about the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of production per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ultimately tells us that to
address food security, controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment ag systems need to improve
overall food access, the broad definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really just about fruits and
vegetables that are the more commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: produced crops in controlled environment
ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really so much about the
availability or total production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally have enough fruits and
vegetables for people to eat, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about physical and economic access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to ask ourselves whether or not
controlled environment agriculture can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a meaningful contribution to
improving physical access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you hear people talk about
this in terms of food deserts,
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty in accessing food retail
stores, for example, even in urban areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also can control environment ag
increase affordability or economic access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk about both of those
things in just a little bit of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can CEA systems improve physical
access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in each case, we should think a
little bit about what the available
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, there really isn't too
much evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CEA operations in urban areas
that are located where there is a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the anecdotal reports and
conversations that I've been involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that this has not really increased
the physical access to those populations
[SPEAKER_00]: for fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, because as you see in the photo
here, many of those CEA produced fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and vegetables are still sold through
traditional retail channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't actually do that much to
change that particular situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The access is still through the locations
that might not be available to those food
[SPEAKER_00]: insecure populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can controlled environment ag increase
economic access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's probably limited scope for
this based on the evidence that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's even for just fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some work looking at the landed
cost of lettuce to markets in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City, either that produced in a field in
California or produced through a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or plant factory in the city of
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that the costs were
considerably higher, more than double the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of production in California,
even when you included the transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and the losses that are higher for
field based production to get that product
[SPEAKER_00]: to New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a considerable increase in the
costs as we understand them now,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for this particular product,
when it's produced in a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and agriculture setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part due to cost of land in New
York City and the energy costs associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we move a bit outside the city
where land costs and perhaps labor costs
[SPEAKER_00]: are lower, it doesn't really change that
basic picture very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The costs are still considerably higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than producing lettuce in California and
transporting it across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on both those scales, the economic
access and the physical access,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some reasons to be doubtful about
what controlled environment agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you may say, well, maybe it's not
so much about that specific definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: food security, but maybe we can still
think about the role that controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment ag can play in making diets
healthier, having people consume more
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I would argue that at present,
there's probably limited scope for much of
[SPEAKER_00]: an impact on micronutrients and healthier
diets for the same reasons that we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do much to improve physical
access or economic access to produce food
[SPEAKER_00]: and controlled environment ag systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, people make
dietary choices for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just making them more affordable or
making them more physically accessible may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be enough to make diets more
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show you on the right hand side of
this slide, some of the factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: influence consumer behavior about items
like fruits and vegetables through the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of programs that have been put in
place to try and increase the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: of fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things like the consumer
awareness and education, consumer food
[SPEAKER_00]: choice attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where CEA might be able to
play a role with more attractive
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, convenience, quality and
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other factors are really the
availability, creating opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: increased consumption might be important
in some settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Affordability can be put in place or
improved by subsidies or vouchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are often folks who talk about
reducing food loss and waste through
[SPEAKER_00]: things like cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these things have been tried to
help address under consumption of fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been some successes,
but it hasn't really moved us far enough
[SPEAKER_00]: along that we say that particular problem
of under consuming fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: are solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not sure whether that leaves us in
terms of controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, except to say there are many
other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if controlled environment
agriculture created more physical access
[SPEAKER_00]: and economic access, that might not be
enough to really make diets more
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningfully helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, my suggestion is
as we continue to gather evidence about
[SPEAKER_00]: the role of CEA and food security,
that we should probably be at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit skeptical in part because we
must address the key issue, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really affordability and access,
not availability as in increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the metrics that we use to
define food security don't really directly
[SPEAKER_00]: align with increased production of fruits
and vegetables in any system, much less in
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately we need to be able to
evaluate the evidence that we have and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to gather evidence so we have a
better understanding of how this might
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is helpful to think about how
the linkages between controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment ag and food security might
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will provide information about how
to communicate with the controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment agriculture group at Cornell
if people would like some additional
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
