[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been at this for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm really excited to hear that
you guys have been working on the flame
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just started on that a few months
ago and we're seeing some really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the most stupid thing in the
world to go out and scorch all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see how dramatically and how
rapidly the turf recovers, but you get
[SPEAKER_02]: this selectivity between certain weeds and
not especially like ceiling control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be even less aggressive on the
flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your recovery is even faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the things we're seeing
with Chris's work out at the vineyard and
[SPEAKER_03]: as soon as, you know, life gets somewhere
back to normal, we'll get you out there to
[SPEAKER_03]: see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did like an early post flame on
crabgrass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw some early seedlings coming up out
there and we went out with a very quick
[SPEAKER_03]: burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't driving very slow at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, did it provide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Percent control season long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the seed rain, Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might be taking out that seed
rain at the top and the grass is just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best time for it to regrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your colleague Goltly liked it on
phrase mowing that juvenile turf,
[SPEAKER_03]: that new tissue coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much more aggressive than sort of
mature plodding along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually helped in long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps your overall quality ability
because it gives the turf room to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets rid of all the old stems and
sticks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even more prevalent for warm season
grasses or stolen infers grasses where you
[SPEAKER_02]: just need to get rid of a lot of that old
stem material.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think further, it's not just about
dead material, but I wonder if this same
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatic defoliation, whether it's phrase
mowing, burning, final sand, clove oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever organic burn, wipoona foaming,
whatever it is, I think that timing of
[SPEAKER_03]: that defoliation, not so much what kind it
is, but the timing may be more critical
[SPEAKER_03]: than actually the way you do it,
but I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're definitely seeing there are
certain weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at all the different turf
types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have a couple of sites
that have just a smorgasbord of weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking at how different
durations of flame per unit area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point I want to figure out
what we're doing in BTUs because one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the issues, you know, like prevailing
atmospheric conditions, ground moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that could factor in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we're seeing huge differences
in plant response, species response,
[SPEAKER_02]: like where that threshold or where that
cliff will be between one weed or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking a half of a minute,
one minute, two minutes, three minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, wherever that non return cliff
is for one species versus another is
[SPEAKER_02]: vastly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing a lot of species
separation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what makes it work is the rapid turf
recovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: In almost all cases, we're getting a
acceptable turf quality back in a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't have thought, and I'm
talking from black scorched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing left but ashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one week later we've got pretty darn
good looking turf and cool season,
[SPEAKER_02]: warm season, cool season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I'm referencing cool season
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our warm season work right now is kind of
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding out as with herbicides
during green ups, not a good time to come
[SPEAKER_02]: out and burn warm season turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably should have been done during
dormancy when the stuff's asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to burn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they thought pesticide odor or drift
was a problem, wait till we start burning
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be pissed about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just introduce everybody here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Zoom kind of updated here in the
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a password.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hopefully I got that out in time
for some people to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess today, as we've been talking
about a little earlier, you've heard Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Askew from Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about POA, some new POA
products that we're really excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked about burning as a
method of weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure we'll get more into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as always, we'll start with Dr. Frank
Rossi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank will give us a little update where
we've been the past two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in the Northeast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, big thanks to Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Carl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Sean for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, big shout to my pal,
Carl, who's put up with me for the last
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who has to put up with me on a
regular basis like this deserves a medal
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, it's heartwarming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to start out with a picture I find
blowing around Twitter when I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: watching Professor Askew devise country
songs to the control of weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real, I have to say, widespread return
of golf course superintendents bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: their families to the golf course and
taking pictures of it, being really proud
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, and celebrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this is particularly warm to
Carl's heart because they're sitting by
[SPEAKER_03]: the side of the green eating Chick-fil-A,
your favorite food.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do a quick weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen you guys in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have caught up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see it feels really warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been really warm during the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still cooling off at night
throughout much of the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_03]: even down where Sean is probably at the
elevation level.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting some differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see by the heat
accumulation, we're still a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the heat has really brought on the
growing degree days, which then gives us
[SPEAKER_03]: an indication about broadleaf weed
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still use this model from Purdue as a
guide of when ester and amine
[SPEAKER_03]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about this in the past since
we're talking weeds today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things we are noticing is
that it's getting a bit dry in many parts
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, maybe not so much, again,
down in Virginia Tech, down in Blacksburg
[SPEAKER_03]: Way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see when you look at
precipitation minus potential
[SPEAKER_03]: evapotranspiration, you can see throughout
much of the Northeast, especially the
[SPEAKER_03]: northern parts of the Northeast,
it's really starting to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that we're expecting further
drying weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting regularly losing around an
inch of water a week now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you're all noticing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're growing grass on sand in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're striving for really good
drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, now water management becomes a
significant part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And boy, did that switch click quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went from cold 40-degree temperatures
to now well into the upper 80s here in
[SPEAKER_03]: upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's fascinating about this,
again, if you look at our weather
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions, you can see heat stress is
defined essentially when your nighttime
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature and your nighttime relative
humidity sum to an excess of 150.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in excess of 150 between
temperature and relative humidity in the
[SPEAKER_03]: evening hours, from 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: to 8 a.m., that gives us heat stress
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one day, two day, three days of those
kinds of things, you can see we're
[SPEAKER_03]: finishing up coming out of some heat
stress that looks like it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: dissipate towards the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got another day of it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth checking out on the forecast
website.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the soils?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the soils are warming
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how they're warming west to east
this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see this pattern sometimes based
on where the winds and the weathers come
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of east wind the last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're gonna see a little bit lower
soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil temperatures makes us think about
soil pathogens, soil borne pathogens,
[SPEAKER_03]: as we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steve McDonald posted a really nice
blog on his Greencast blog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve McDonald is a must follow kind of
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he writes or does things, he's always
worth paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the value of being observant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is take all patch in higher cut
bentgrass that he doesn't see very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a picture taken recently where
you see alternative plants growing inside
[SPEAKER_03]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bentgrass at lawn height cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what about diseases?
[SPEAKER_03]: The conversation is a little bit more
involved than it used to be in the early
[SPEAKER_03]: season when nothing was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now if you go to our forecast
website, you'll see this historical and
[SPEAKER_03]: predictive modeling of various disease and
pest pressure like weeds and diseases as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here is the map over the last 30
days down in Farmingdale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually track the Bethpage State Park
where we do a lot of our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see over the last several
days, anthracnose pressure has been pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about dollar spot pressure?
[SPEAKER_03]: High and looks like it's getting a little
bit higher building throughout the north.
[SPEAKER_03]: East.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, this is the kind of thing you
want to keep track of and your
[SPEAKER_03]: Smith-Kernes model as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of note from Mike Hadley at
the Black Horse about annual bluegrass
[SPEAKER_03]: weevil already starting to take out some
collars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early indications, right, where adults
were tough to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were spread out a long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't use adulticides with the
absence of Dersban now at Bethpage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have to rely on larvicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, obviously, this is beginning to
give indications that we've got to get
[SPEAKER_03]: those larvicides out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's Steve's blog post about adult
activity and larval activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the conversation for today is around
this particular problem that Piper and
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakley talked to us many, many moons about
in the original Turf for Golf Course's
[SPEAKER_03]: book, the very first one published.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still something that we've
struggled with as an industry for those
[SPEAKER_03]: that look on it as a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, the conversation is annual
bluegrass as a weed, not annual bluegrass
[SPEAKER_03]: in maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know, Sean has a
wonderful presentation he's given.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be from a seminar or
something, Sean, where you've done this
[SPEAKER_03]: really comprehensive review of just about
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to know what's going on in
annual bluegrass control, just looking
[SPEAKER_03]: through the slides in this presentation
that I pulled just to prompt our
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation today, Sean, what a wonderful
job you did here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you've done some of the price
comparisons with the different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people forget progress, exonerate,
velocity, tenacity, all with post-emergent
[SPEAKER_03]: activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a really nice job of looking under
this particular study where you looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: a variety of different annual bluegrass
control programs over a two-year period.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I like when people send out data
that's multiple years of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, as we introduced
Methazolin, a product developed by S.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim, a Cornell alum, now in South Korea,
many years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're having this conversation
in 2020, Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when this thing was going to be
labeled in 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is your work from the early
teens, 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you sprayed the first one in 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the dramatic picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture that you just showed there was
actually from Kyung Han's work at Penn
[SPEAKER_02]: State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyung is now like national leader for
Pol-Cure in the USA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he did that work at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's been a long ride since
2009 and a pretty cool one, except for the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that, like you said, we've been for
10 years expecting imminent registration
[SPEAKER_02]: and finally it's here, finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's start with the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me that we've had products
that can kill po-annular.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is we like them on greens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it dies, you know, the ball don't
roll so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've also, we're not going to get
into that because if I let Carl loose on
[SPEAKER_03]: your study with the ball deflection,
we'll get nowhere on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just talk about let's start
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other post-emergent products.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes Methazolin different?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing that has limited our
application on greens for so long is the
[SPEAKER_02]: inability to get true selectivity between
bentgrass and polar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have products that can kill polar,
but the putting green management,
[SPEAKER_02]: the agronomy on a green is such that we
are so sensitive to environmental stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're so sensitive to have roots and
essence rapidly, and we're always in this
[SPEAKER_02]: ebb and flow trying to read what the turf
is telling us, respond to it, and keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And herbicides, I don't think there is a
herbicide on the planet that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get your salary by managing
bentgrass stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbicide doesn't help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Poecure is the best ever at giving us
that selectivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a herbicide and we still have
things we need to tip the toe around,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's the best at selectivity between
polar and bent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the product is, it's got just a lot
of really good things that we would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a very quick environmental
degradation, which you would think,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it to hang around and kill the
polar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the good news is you can go through
five to seven half-lives of this product
[SPEAKER_02]: and still get polar pre-emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using it at the 0.6 fluid ounce
rates that were recommended in
[SPEAKER_02]: post-emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still, it's rapid degradation but
huge selectivity between polar and bent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can, it also gives us the
ability, but we don't know the mode of
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of work on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not yet there yet, but the way it
works, it gives us the ability to just
[SPEAKER_02]: turn that nut a little bit further and a
little bit further until we slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: transition out the pole, which is we've
had other products, ALS inhibiting
[SPEAKER_02]: products, photosystem inhibitors that you
just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it does, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now, or if you dial it back
a little bit, it just absolutely does not
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get complete recovery every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've never been able to say,
okay, well, I'm going to put six apps out
[SPEAKER_02]: in a strategy that's part spring,
part fall, and just slowly transition the
[SPEAKER_02]: pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says they want that slow
transition, but then they start applying
[SPEAKER_02]: the product and they're like, oh man,
it's not dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, just hang in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the downside is in order to get that
slow transition, it takes one to two years
[SPEAKER_02]: and no one, everyone goes in saying,
I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they get halfway in saying,
man, I'm not cool with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening fast enough,
but that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that product can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was first chatting with,
what is the young man's name that was at
[SPEAKER_03]: Penn State, Kyung?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyung, yeah, Kyung.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I met Kyung many times when he was
first going around when this was first
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things he used to say to me
early on was they were using it in Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, Frank, they just sprayed it
on these warm season grass fairways and
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't see, they didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: All they did was just let what was there
sort of fill in and do its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me ask two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is you said it takes a number of
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with best practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand the jargon is fall program,
spring program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to get into the minutias of
rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's important, but let's start
with what are best practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, do you need to seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can this happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's refine our comments even
further, Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about putting greens because
what your work showed too is there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of good products for fairways,
tees and rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of good products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody pays attention to you made the case
for exonerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's maybe a better product out there
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we only go talk about greens,
we don't then then rate becomes easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is only one rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 0.6 fluid ounce per thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the question becomes how many
applications am I going to apply at what
[SPEAKER_02]: frequency and when?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're applying those applications
in the spring, what you're gaining from
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a very slow, like a stunning of
growth and a very slow reduction of
[SPEAKER_02]: population that with say three spring
applications, you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get much more than 10, 20% population
reduction with spring programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that is not your I'm going to
renovate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kill it all program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to arrest expansion and set
ourselves up to get it's all about what
[SPEAKER_02]: are we paying an injury risk to bent or
well, what are we paying in risk to the
[SPEAKER_02]: putting of quality is really what it is
because the product is safe on bent unless
[SPEAKER_02]: we really do something outside of the
herbicide that is stressful that the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide then can then exacerbate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we might get some bent injury,
but the product alone at the rates we're
[SPEAKER_02]: using will not harm bent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the fall application set up the power
like programs does for the fall?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the spring programs are getting us in
hopefully a little bit better position to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a little more bent than we had so that
we can go after the pole in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two applications is usually all it
takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three is in most cases going to be
complete renovation of POA if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're, if you have a population
that's not responding to poor cure very
[SPEAKER_02]: well, then what you, when I say turn that
nut a little bit tighter, what you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: is you can shift one or two of those
spring applications into the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really going to ramp up product
performance for killing POA, which again,
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone needs to remember, I know you
want it dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it dead, but what we're struggling
against with this herbicide and with our
[SPEAKER_02]: playability is to take the pole out
slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you put, now you could save some
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're willing to take that decline in
putting quality peel and swallow it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could go out with four fall
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your pole out and the following
spring, what you're going to be left with
[SPEAKER_02]: is if you're dealing with a 50 to 70% pole
green, what you'll be left with is the
[SPEAKER_02]: bent grass is going to wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pole is all going to look crappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can manage that with colorants,
but it's going to start to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to start to melt out before
the bit can fill in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to end up dealing with about
four weeks of pitted putting surfaces,
[SPEAKER_02]: something on par with an aeration event.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you grow that in, you're
essentially pure bent and a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may be a strategy some people are
looking for, but most people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go toward a couple of spring apps and two
to three fall apps, or more often maybe up
[SPEAKER_02]: to four spring apps and up to two fall
apps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's lots of ways, but one of the
things I think is critical and Carl and I
[SPEAKER_03]: know this because we study a little bit
the decision-making practices of
[SPEAKER_03]: superintendents and the deliberateness on
some cases and the reflexive in other
[SPEAKER_03]: cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when is a good time to know if what
you're doing is working?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say I did the two fall treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I know when I got to turn that nut?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking at the same time,
you develop the late fall applications
[SPEAKER_03]: seed head control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's happening to POA annual,
even in a perennial form in that part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me number one, what do you think's
going on with POA at that time of the year
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe is helping with methadone
control as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how, when do I evaluate it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I evaluate it the summer of next year
to know if what I'm doing is working?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I do think the evaluation
is going to be in year two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on your scenario and what
you want, I think so the way right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way the product's being marketed is
superintendents go to POACURE.com and they
[SPEAKER_02]: enter a direct relationship with a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every, so right now all but five U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: States have registrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of which New York is one that does not
have registrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: California is not one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida is not one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington and let's see, New York,
California, Washington, and I can't read
[SPEAKER_02]: my writing on the other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's in New Jersey and Connecticut,
it's somehow going to leak through to
[SPEAKER_03]: Hudson River.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't want to talk candidly
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's going to be a lot of
scrutiny of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just say you work directly with
the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a sales person that you
generally will deal with the way you do
[SPEAKER_02]: with your other products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are going to get from you what do
you want and they're going to give to you
[SPEAKER_02]: here's what we recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also one of the things that they've
implemented is if you did not do the EUP
[SPEAKER_02]: or have not tested the product on your
course before now, then they are requiring
[SPEAKER_02]: that your maximum purchase in year one is
only four bottles, which is only enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: do some experimentation on your course.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say screw that, I want to get
started now, then you have to sign a
[SPEAKER_02]: waiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're strongly encouraging people to
get on-site experience with the product
[SPEAKER_02]: before they proceed because of the
sensitivity of putting greens and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question you asked was,
all right, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: The scenarios are going to be probably
five or six applications per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be catered
predominantly in the spring and less in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you're done with exactly what that
program implementation is, that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time to question is this working is
not midstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the mistakes that we've
seen over and over in all the
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get midstream and say, ah,
it's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we didn't spray that product because
Joe said it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where we've run into a lot
of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or people say, yeah, put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went ahead one week later and put
another dose out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get rapid activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so one year out, the second
year is when you assess where are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we get where we want to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to change things up?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so it's about seeding as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's just let's there's these two
other things that are critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: When this thing was coming up and it
looked like a registration was imminent,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a note that went out to the
folks that were tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was privy to it that, hey,
you can't do this near drain lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't need to get into the politics
of this, but I this would hold it up in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And worse yet, if it has water quality or
water movement, stuff, it's a no sale on
[SPEAKER_03]: Long Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to say that to my Long Island
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you, Long Island friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had issues, I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it wasn't really a political thing
that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was it was kind of a speed
of flow through issue with EPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They originally the company had submitted
all the documentation for aquatic
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked for and received a waiver from
the EPA that allowed them to use Asian
[SPEAKER_02]: trout instead of rainbow trout,
which is normally what they require.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, they already had data on Asian trout,
which was exactly what the EPA wanted,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they didn't have it on rainbow trout.
[SPEAKER_02]: EPA said, sure, give us the Asian trout.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the Asian trout data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right before the EUP, the experimental
use permit program that you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, where the drain tile issue came up
right before that happened, one of the EPA
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists just wasn't happy about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a no effect level, but he wasn't
happy about one of those Asian trout
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they essentially, midstream,
changed their mind and said, we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: Asian trout anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to do the rainbow trout that
is in our documentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of reneged on, you know,
they basically rejected the Asian trout
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to study redone with rainbow
trout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then two things happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first was the company had to then do,
I don't know, a million dollar rainbow
[SPEAKER_02]: trout study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of those delays.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other is EPA suddenly puts the product
in a category, OK, we don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: aquatic tox data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since we don't have any data,
we add data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't qualify now because the guy
said, I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they placed it in a category of,
you know, we got to err on the side of
[SPEAKER_02]: safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they put that restriction on the
EUP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the SE formulation is registered
in the United States, here's your proof
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No drain tower restriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the only stipulation regarding
water is that you cannot spray the product
[SPEAKER_02]: directly into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an island green is good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spray right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no buffer zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spray right to within an inch of
water as long as you know that you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying on the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll give you, you know,
making it through California and New York,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to be the acid test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially Long Island, which is much
like California.
[SPEAKER_03]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, six applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to keep it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be coming back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I keep using Methasolin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I worried about developing resistance?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's of course, as a weed scientist
comes to my mind, but also can I
[SPEAKER_03]: transition to a Trimit program?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I transition to a tenacity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not what Benkress is, but some
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you recommend, number one,
about resistance management and two,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming other products are going to
be part and parcel of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a resistance management
standpoint, on the one hand, as you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are, we're placing ourselves in a
scenario that is ripe for developing
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance because to ensure Benkgrass
playability, we are trying to dial the
[SPEAKER_02]: rate back and meter the product out at
these low sublethal rates until finally we
[SPEAKER_02]: get the mortality that we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that mortality is coming from a
combination, not just of the herbicide,
[SPEAKER_02]: which the herbicide could do it,
but we're using herbicide plus Benk
[SPEAKER_02]: competition to get that job and
environmental stress to get that job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're setting ourselves up to develop
resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, we have a system
that is much, much less capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: developing resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I say that is we have a
product that's going to be priced such
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's going to be targeted
applications only primary greens,
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise targeted to collars or localized
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to be bringing
resistant seed from elsewhere on the golf
[SPEAKER_02]: course onto greens, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The resistance problem, if it's going to
develop, it's going to develop on the
[SPEAKER_02]: green and you better damn well be managing
it on the grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you see, once you go through a
renovation program, which I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: should take, you should be two years out
before you consider to put the rubber
[SPEAKER_02]: stamp on that and say we're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you should be managing any
escape pole with a pocket knife.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be managing with a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've done work with dabbers
using pachybutazole, which is a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: cool option to limit green stress dabbers
with Polacure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you can, you know, save some money
and isolate the product only where you
[SPEAKER_02]: want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really good options to manage
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're on these little isolated islands
where the product is applied and we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to worry about nasty stuff coming in
from the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to keep resistance from
becoming an issue on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does sound like it's on your mind
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we get this really good tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had really good tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is human behavior where if we don't
steward it properly, if we don't manage
[SPEAKER_03]: our P's and Q's in the way we're using it,
we're going to lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no matter what companies tell us,
we, you know, listen, money's only going
[SPEAKER_03]: to stop a certain layer of this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some parts of this industry that
money is not going to stop them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you more concerned if we go to T's and
fairways and approaches?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so we've got, we've got another
thing that's helping us out besides site
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity in the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an alternate mode of action and
it's called turf grass competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resistance development in turf is not
completely, but mostly limited to dormant
[SPEAKER_02]: turf situations like pole annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire Southern United States is
resistant to trizines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting resistant to ALS's,
DNA's because they're targeting POA in a
[SPEAKER_02]: period when they don't have that alternate
mode of action, when they don't have that
[SPEAKER_02]: turf competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the North, we're pretty much always
going to have turf competition to help
[SPEAKER_02]: manage that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Korea, they've been using the product
for pretty much a decade now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No cases of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been using it now in Japan for a
year or a little over a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no cases of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far in practice, yeah, we're always
worried about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because listen, we associate
resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go, we'll do a little deep dive
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's questions,
Carl, but I got a weed scientist,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the questions popping up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my head, I mean, in my mind,
I'm thinking if we don't even know the
[SPEAKER_03]: mode of action, you can't seem to isolate
cell wall or the TAT mode of action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible it's multi-site in a way
that we're not familiar with even testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, everybody talks about
these herbicides like this one's an ALS
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibitor and that one is a photosystem
inhibitor bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each herbicide is going to have,
well, potentially can have, don't let me
[SPEAKER_02]: overstep my bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a physiologist, but these
herbicides can have a different mechanism
[SPEAKER_02]: of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of acting on one species than they do in
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quinclorac is an excellent example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is not killing crabgrass via
hormone induced oxen mimicry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killing crabgrass by being a cell
wall biosynthesis inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have a product that kills
clover as an oxen mimic and crabgrass as a
[SPEAKER_02]: CBI.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our lab, we have, pretty much proven
that there is a very low level,
[SPEAKER_02]: a very low level TAT inhibition going on,
or at least something that causes
[SPEAKER_02]: bleaching symptoms and can be very
partially mitigated by adding back
[SPEAKER_02]: homogenistic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we agree with the German lab in that
respect that the TAT inhibition is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening, but what we were able to show
that unlike what they concluded,
[SPEAKER_02]: TAT is not killing polar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not killing polar and it's
definitely not even a major player.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't think it is the element
that's responsible for killing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We repeated all of the studies that had
been done and we found that the results
[SPEAKER_02]: that they showed were kind of exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some of the same stuff,
but nowhere near at the magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we looked at it on polar,
it was nonexistent on polar, whereas on
[SPEAKER_02]: duckweed it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but we know it does act on TAT.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen actual bleached plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the field, like broadleaf plants and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the true mechanism of killing POA,
Dr. Koo, SJ Koo, the CEO of the company,
[SPEAKER_02]: he believes that it's probably a mechanism
that's related to the graminicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the ACC ACE inhibitors,
either a lipid biosynthesis inhibition or
[SPEAKER_02]: a fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, I mean, it has this odd
selectivity that is another way to get at
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, listen, we can talk about this
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl, are there questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one from John.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Sean was touching on earlier
about maybe some abiotic factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: could come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's wondering if there's any concerns,
high heat days, if you're applying it then
[SPEAKER_00]: in March, I know it's kind of,
maybe you'll get a random 90 degree day,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything to be concerned with there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so the thing to be concerned about
is stress and in particular stress that
[SPEAKER_02]: can lead to root senescence in POA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have seen is aeration,
for example, if you put POA cure out in
[SPEAKER_02]: conjunction with an airification and top
dressing event, we pretty much every time
[SPEAKER_02]: see much more rapid POA annual control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on occasion, we've seen bent injury,
some mild phyto.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had one series of studies that
we repeated and saw consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do this, if you have a stressful
airification, plus ethyphon, there is
[SPEAKER_02]: something going on with the ethylene
escalation that's happening from ethyphon
[SPEAKER_02]: and ethylene acts as a hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, and it's shown to promote
senescence, ripening, et cetera and other,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that ethylene escalation from
the ethyphon is causing that
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally induced root senescence to
go nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're losing, where normally we would
lose 30% of the roots, we might be losing
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% of the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have to come back from the
crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: If POA cure is on the ground and you're in
the middle of a repeated application
[SPEAKER_02]: spring POA cure program and you lose 80%
of your roots, if it weren't for the POA
[SPEAKER_02]: cure, one week later, no big deal,
roots would be back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got a band of POA cure right
there and the roots have to come back from
[SPEAKER_02]: the crown, 50, 60, 70% of them,
at least while the POA cure concentration
[SPEAKER_02]: is high enough, they're not coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either we'll lose bit grass or you're
going to be able to go out and pull a plug
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, whoa, on the POA, POA cure
treated side, I got like almost no roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over here where I didn't treat POA
cure, it's already back down to 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, you have to manage stress as
best as you can while you're in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of a POA cure program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either get your airification,
like if you're core airifying,
[SPEAKER_02]: get that healed in before you start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always want to be two weeks apart from
any other potentially stressful
[SPEAKER_02]: application, like a packer butazole or
procrimadol, like an airification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks before or after, and you want
your POA cure program in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So listen, if one of the things we see a
lot of people doing, and there certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: are places where this could happen as a
result of the pandemic and maybe some
[SPEAKER_03]: right sizing people may decide,
hey, maybe we're going to have bent grass
[SPEAKER_03]: greens now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I start out with a really good bent
grass green, when do or do I ever consider
[SPEAKER_03]: a POA cure program?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I just do dotting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I go to a PGR program?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about those people that
might've put bent grass in recently or the
[SPEAKER_03]: last five years, some POA is coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about for approaching it where you
got a lot of good competition?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's a lot of people that
are going to fit that mold because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to, one thing POA cure can't do for
you is it can't update your bent grass
[SPEAKER_02]: variety, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are going to take that
advantage and say, okay, now I can keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: clean, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you can get on, so the POA
cure is being, as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're marketing it, there's two
strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the renovation strategy,
which is get rid of the old POA that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have and while keeping the bent you have
and growing it back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a maintenance program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the maintenance program is two apps a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to cost for the year less than
a PGR program would for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going out with trim it on a
routine program, and that's cost,
[SPEAKER_02]: can you say 3,500 a year?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about what your maintenance program
for POA cure to keep POA from coming into
[SPEAKER_02]: those new greens would cost somewhere in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty sure what they're going to
promote is kind of a strategy where you
[SPEAKER_02]: rotate between, you know, PGR or you
could, if you want to do both,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got the budget, you can come in
with that single spring app of POA cure,
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.6 fluid ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two weeks later, at least you get
on whatever you're, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: cutlass, if you're doing trim it,
or one of those types of programs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get on that and stay on
that to make sure that anything midsummer
[SPEAKER_02]: can't come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the fall, you're going to hit
it again with POA cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that program is meant to keep a
long-term residual of methiazole and in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil so that new POA seedlings that
are brought in by cleats and God knows
[SPEAKER_02]: what else, a watershed over the green
can't, you know, get whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that program is part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, always keep that resistance in
the back of your mind and always try to
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with your own strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rotate other strategies into that
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to hear it's been in Korea for a
decade and they're not talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl, we're well past, you know,
if you don't say something, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are there other questions or we're
going to thank Sean and get him on with
[SPEAKER_03]: his day?
[SPEAKER_00]: No more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was, that was a really good
summary of this though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously we'll throw this up on
the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 85 degrees in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not labor country songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got one for POA cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't heard any of my rap or rock
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just figured with, with, with,
with where you are and how you sound,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you're built for the country music
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me a link.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make, we'll promote you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they do sound a little bit better,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You rapping, you rapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a pleasure seeing you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we don't know when we'll see you
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this was a little bit of a
respite for everybody during a really
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so lucky to have great colleagues
