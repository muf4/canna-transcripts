[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to introduce our first speaker
and his name is Dr. Frank Caruso.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a professor of plant pathology at
the University of Massachusetts Cranberry
[SPEAKER_03]: Station in East Wareham, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has research goals in a wide variety of
cranberry disease systems and we are very
[SPEAKER_03]: pleased to have him today to talk to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Caruso, I hope that you are there
and are ready to begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we having some audio problems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, remember that little, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can hear, gotcha, you're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cutting out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's cutting out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear anything in my earphones
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, we can hear you beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it appears.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to hear any background
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should actually be quiet in the back.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my presentation?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's loading.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this takes longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hope it doesn't take as long as
it did the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems to be going better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at 50% now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't usually get nervous for talks like
this anymore, but there's so much stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that can happen for this not to happen in
its full fruition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope I have a better day today than
Bill Belichick had on Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for the presentation to pop up
in front of me here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I can get started when I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still don't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Frank, you might want to check
your toggle button and make sure that that
[SPEAKER_03]: little thing stays on because apparently
we're getting a little bit of cutting out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember this was happening to Annemiek
the other day when we did our practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the talk in front of me now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have your time on Sunday with
us, don't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not see any cranberry growers,
but even if you grow something else,
[SPEAKER_05]: never assume that you're not going to grow
cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So listen intently here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk today about cranberry
diseases, particularly the East Coast
[SPEAKER_05]: version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of all of our diseases, the most
important one that we have to deal with is
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, fruit rot consists of two things,
field rot before the berries are harvested
[SPEAKER_05]: and storage rot after the berries are
harvested.
[SPEAKER_05]: The berries go into storage, which doesn't
impact you unless you are a fresh fruit
[SPEAKER_05]: grower, which for us in Massachusetts is
about 10% of our harvested material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember this had issues advancing
the other day in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to be patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big file and hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be hard to get through my
talk in 30 minutes if this is what it's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to take to advance each one of these
slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, hopefully it might be getting
better as it kind of gets warmed up here
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully it'll improve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course I've pushed the button
four times, which means it's probably
[SPEAKER_05]: going to jump ahead to the fourth slide
when it finally comes on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Field rot is an issue every year for
cranberry growers and it's a huge,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, you guys are getting it before I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like it's, it's advancing to
probably ahead of where it's supposed to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still have, yeah, well see this is,
this is strange because I'm still on the
[SPEAKER_05]: first slide, the fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruit rot slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are ahead of me and it's hard for
me to talk until I have the slide in front
[SPEAKER_05]: of me here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Early rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now I've got to back up,
but maybe I'll say the heck with backing
[SPEAKER_05]: up because it's going to take forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just backed up one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have to wait for me to go back
once.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm never going to back up and I'm
never going to push this arrow more than
[SPEAKER_05]: once.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to have to be very patient.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, I had a couple slides
that you're not going to see, but at any
[SPEAKER_05]: rate, the fruit rot that you get in the
field that goes to the handler does not
[SPEAKER_05]: include the berries that you can see right
here, which are the ones that are left
[SPEAKER_05]: behind on the bog that we see as trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are very small and they never make
it onto the truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, although there may be some fruit
worm mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our rots can be readily
identifiable by symptoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one that you can see here is the one
we call early rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically what you'll see for this one
is concentric circles on the berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our first rot that shows up in the
field.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is caused by the fungus phylosticta.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all fungal induced fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_05]: End rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the symptoms on the calyx end
of the berry here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm even having issues with the pointer
here, but there's the pointer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the rot that's developing
there on the calyx end.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is caused by the fungus Fusicaucum.
[SPEAKER_05]: These berries on the right here,
these are ones caused by ripe rot,
[SPEAKER_05]: Coleofoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also having issues with the pointer,
which doesn't seem to be working here
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Healthy berries on the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coleofoma is the causal agent here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have to wait for the next slide
to pop up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I have to be very patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry for interrupting, but if you
want to host, then we can watch your
[SPEAKER_03]: cursor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just have to promise that you
won't push any buttons that change
[SPEAKER_03]: everything on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way we can watch your cursor if
you would like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't I do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just click change your status.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we should be able to watch your
cursor.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one you see is black rot,
which turns the berries totally jet black.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the causal agent of this one is
Elantophomopsis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, nothing is coming up in a very
timely fashion here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, patience is a virtue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have printed out these things so
I knew it was coming ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know you guys all seem to be
getting these before I do here,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still looking at black rot here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we had issues with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now I have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is miscellaneous rot, which means
these are berries that you can't readily
[SPEAKER_05]: identify.
[SPEAKER_05]: By a particular fungus, these ones here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to isolate and determine what
the causal agent is, these berries have to
[SPEAKER_05]: be in my hand so that I can culture out
fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, waiting for Godot here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still looking at miscellaneous rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's obviously many issues that have to
be dealt with here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, Frank, we haven't had this
problem before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on because this
has never happened before.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has followed me my whole life,
creation of new problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, just because you have berries
that look like here,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is not a fruit rot situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are berries that were scalded by
very quick heat temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are rotted berries on the left here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can tell they're rotted berries
because you can see all the anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_05]: essence around the area of rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is how you can tell that you have
fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those scalded berries will
eventually look like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I don't see them in the field right
after they've been scalded, I can't tell
[SPEAKER_05]: the difference between rot and scald.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have cultured as many as nine different
fungi out of one rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rotted berry, and in some instances,
you'll have a berry like this one here
[SPEAKER_05]: that has absolutely no rot on it at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one on the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a real disease complex for fruit
rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, there are 12 listed
organisms here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that have two asterisks affixed
to them are the ones that are the most
[SPEAKER_05]: important for us in Massachusetts and
pretty much in New Jersey as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the Midwest in Wisconsin and
the Pacific Northwest and Oregon,
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington and British Columbia,
they're very different situations out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fungus phylosticta can also cause a
disease symptom we call blossom blast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually see some of the fruiting
bodies of the pathogen right here and
[SPEAKER_05]: right here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruit rot management includes a true
integration integrated approach of many
[SPEAKER_05]: things from the application of fungicides
to the using of flood waters, keeping good
[SPEAKER_05]: air circulations by pruning the vines or
sanding the vines, removal of trash after
[SPEAKER_05]: the flood, irrigating them properly,
and using cultivars that are less
[SPEAKER_05]: susceptible to fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a list of our fungicides that were
registered in this past growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see we have a wide range of active
ingredients that we can choose from.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best one of these by far is the
chlorothalonil group, bravo, chloranil,
[SPEAKER_05]: echo, equis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although some of these other ones are very
good as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our fungicides go on when the cranberry
blossoms go into bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually our first application going on a
10% bloom followed in Massachusetts by two
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequent applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will use one or two more in New
Jersey because they have a bigger issue of
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit rot in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a conventional situation, which is one
where they don't use a spring reflood that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be talking about shortly,
again the fungicides go on early during
[SPEAKER_05]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: To apply those fungicides you must use the
phenological plant development.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go by just because you applied your
first application June 15th last year that
[SPEAKER_05]: you should do the same this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some years were two weeks ahead,
some years were two weeks behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have mostly protectant fungicides,
but now we have some new materials that do
[SPEAKER_05]: have kickback activity or systemic
activity indoor and abound.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to determine whether your fate of
your fruit are going to be processed or
[SPEAKER_05]: for fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your cultivars will determine what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stevens being the most resistant,
Ben Lear being the most susceptible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should never use any fungicide.
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes for you blueberry growers
dealing with blueberry diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should never use a fungicide at less
than a registered rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a good reason why that high rate
and low rate are there because we've done
[SPEAKER_05]: the testing ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a material like a Bravo that
has very good sticking agents you should
[SPEAKER_05]: not add something to it to add presumably
better sticking ability because you'll end
[SPEAKER_05]: up with phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: For us late water is a particular
management of water that we use by
[SPEAKER_05]: flooding from mid April until mid May.
[SPEAKER_05]: By using this you can reduce your number
of applications to as few as one
[SPEAKER_05]: applications during the current growing
season and subsequent years as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use later applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tricky thing is when you use late
water is that bloom will be completely
[SPEAKER_05]: pressed into a shorter time period and
your plants will be very susceptible to
[SPEAKER_05]: frost coming out of that flood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trash piles you'll see bauxite and these
trash piles are a tremendous source of
[SPEAKER_05]: inoculum.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see the fruiting bodies on this
one leaf and the fruiting bodies on this
[SPEAKER_05]: one berry that are sitting right in that
trash pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pathogenic fungi that are
overwintering here.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the irrigation goes you should
never water at night going into the long
[SPEAKER_05]: evening where the water film will sit on
the plants for 12 to 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water in the early morning this goes if
you have any kind of plants you should
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigate in the early morning to minimize
the optimal conditions for infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have some cultivars that do have
some field rot resistance as you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have ones that have good storage
rot resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some new cultivars available to
growers coming out of the Rutgers breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: program and the Wisconsin breeding program
and we're still trying to assess the
[SPEAKER_05]: susceptibility and resistance of these
particular cultivars to fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're getting a pretty good idea so
far what their situation is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now some of these fruit rot pathogens can
also cause leaf spot in newly planted
[SPEAKER_05]: beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems to be an increasing problem and
you can see the fungus that's probably the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important is the one at the top there
phylosticta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although calatotrichum seems to be a big
problem issue causing organism as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a situation where we have a leaf
spot and you can see the fruiting bodies
[SPEAKER_05]: on this particular leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are simply symptoms of the fungus
phylosticta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again you can see the fruiting bodies on
the leaves and how it can significantly
[SPEAKER_05]: defoliate the plants if the infection is
severe.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact with this fungus we're now even
seeing stem cankers on some of the stems
[SPEAKER_05]: because some of our new cultivars are
particularly susceptible to phylosticta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright leaving fruit rot behind and what
I'd like to do is leave questions to the
[SPEAKER_05]: end so I can keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next disease of importance for us is
phytophthora root rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same phytophthora that affects
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what it does in a cranberry bed
and you can see how much death of the
[SPEAKER_05]: vines are occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also see how poor the drainage is
in this particular area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's an aerial shot showing you the
significant areas of this disease that can
[SPEAKER_05]: occur in a particular bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing to scoff at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using my pointer I will show you where the
new areas of the disease are occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it early is the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again you can see the areas of poor
drainage and the areas of dieback in this
[SPEAKER_05]: particular bog.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are some artificially inoculated
plants that we did years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a healthy plant and here's a
phytophthora infected plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what it does to the root
systems and that's why the top of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants turn red and will eventually die.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see they're typically yellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's phytophthora infected plants which
are typically an olivaceous color,
[SPEAKER_05]: very readily identifiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take these roots here and you put
them on culture media within 48 to 72
[SPEAKER_05]: hours we have the fungus phytophthora
cinnamomi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do a very quick diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do this with blueberries as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did some earlier this summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the sporangium filled with
sporangia spores that will spread the
[SPEAKER_05]: fungus around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can readily spread in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the causal agents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phytophthora cinnamomi is the most
important one but we will find these two
[SPEAKER_05]: other species of phytophthora present.
[SPEAKER_05]: Managing phytophthora root rot is again a
truly integrated disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a lot of things need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The low spots need to be improved drainage
wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can assist this by sanding those
areas, fertilizing the peripheral plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: using some resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fungicides are very important in
preventing the spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of these, this is the one that you need to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: First and foremost and in many cases if
you do this one you don't need to do any
[SPEAKER_05]: of the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are some means of improving the
drainage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the area of phytophthora there
and how they improve the drainage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Digging the ditches out, maintaining good
drainage is another important means of
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling this disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sanding, applying sand to the affected
area as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice when these things advance in a
timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are peripheral plants that were
originally red and with careful
[SPEAKER_05]: fertilizing they have greened up nicely
and are now moving back into the area of
[SPEAKER_05]: dead vines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ritamil and Alliette are our two most
utilized fungicides.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the same ones that you can use for
blueberry phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_05]: Upright dieback, boy it really helps if
you get into a nice rhythm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just clicking now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Upright dieback is a disease that we will
see every year in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also see in New Jersey, in Wisconsin,
in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is typically what you will see and we
will see some infections that will affect
[SPEAKER_05]: 25 to 30 percent of the uprights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the individual bed you may
have only vegetative uprights affected on
[SPEAKER_05]: a 500 to 1 basis versus the fruiting
uprights or you may see a 1 to 1 situation
[SPEAKER_05]: where fruiting uprights are getting
clobbered just as badly as the vegetative
[SPEAKER_05]: ones are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your symptom right here going from
the tip downward.
[SPEAKER_05]: On this one you can see every single one
of your uprights are affected.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the causal agents of upright
dieback.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've proven Fomopsis, we've proven
Cinquanoblastia, we've proven Fusacocum.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think Colatotrichum is also involved
but Fomopsis, no question, this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important fungicide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Management of upright dieback includes
several things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Avoiding stress on the plants,
managing fruit rot because those organisms
[SPEAKER_05]: that were listed there, not only can they
cause upright dieback, they can also cause
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're multi-faceted pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Massachusetts and New Jersey we're
allowed to use a pre-bloom application of
[SPEAKER_05]: Bravo or Champ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bravo is the better one and as any
diseases, avoid excessive vine growth
[SPEAKER_05]: because this allows for perfect conditions
for fungal infection to occur.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the stage that you need to have of
your vines when you apply the fungicide
[SPEAKER_05]: for upright dieback management.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairy ring is a disease that we have in
Massachusetts and New Jersey only.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an east coast disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your typical rings right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this bog has rings all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Stevens which is the most susceptible
coltivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a close up of another ring that you
can see right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rings are typically found right on the
ditches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we may actually change the name of
this disease to another disease based on
[SPEAKER_05]: the finding that we have a very unique
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one here, we may end up calling the
disease violet root rot instead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are still working out all the
details on the life cycle of this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very complicated life cycle where
it consists of a haploid mycoparasitic
[SPEAKER_05]: stage and a dicariotic phytoparasitic
stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the one you need to control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here on Cranberries, the
phytoparasitic stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves a lot of different organism
structures that the fungus will produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Management of this, we're still working
out the details on this, but again,
[SPEAKER_05]: avoiding stress, applying a bound Indar or
FurBam, but FurBam comes later.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't apply FurBam until after June
1st.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use these after May 1st.
[SPEAKER_05]: And watering these things, these Indar and
a bound applications in before and after
[SPEAKER_05]: applications seem to work the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we have some minor diseases that we
really don't have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I listed them here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to show you some pictures
just to show you what they look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will essentially wrap up the
presentation here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's look at some typical symptoms of
these.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Protoventuria leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see this one every year in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're typically diagnostic symptoms on
the upper surface of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Parenobotrys leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another leaf spotting fungus, very similar
to Protoventuria.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Rosebloom, which is one of the
three exobasidium-caused diseases that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the East Coast, we've only seen this on
Nantucket Island so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a West Coast disease,
but this is the typical flowery type of
[SPEAKER_05]: overgrowth that you have on the second
year buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is red leaf spot caused by another
species of exobasidium.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had quite a lot of this this year
because the weather was so wet and so
[SPEAKER_05]: cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is red shoot disease,
a typical shoot infected by this
[SPEAKER_05]: particular species of exobasidium,
three different species of exobasidium
[SPEAKER_05]: involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is not the same fungus that causes
fairy ring and turf.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cotton ball disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the mycelium on the inside of
these berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen cotton ball in one berry in
Massachusetts in 25 growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the fungus and the disease are here,
but it's not an issue for us like it is in
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin and in Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin, this is their number one
disease problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fungus is very closely related to the
mummyberry fungus in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a shoot blight phase that you can
see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the fungus will sporulate on this
material producing knidia, and those
[SPEAKER_05]: knidia infect the blossoms and result in
those berries that show the typical cotton
[SPEAKER_05]: ball symptoms in the berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, I wish these were advancing like this
early on, and I hadn't lost my patience so
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is frost blight.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is frost blight.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is frost blight.
[SPEAKER_05]: No fruit produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of our virus diseases,
our few virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is ringspot, red ringspot probably,
the same as we have in blueberries,
[SPEAKER_05]: symptoms on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not impact the yield from
everything that we've been able to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the symptoms on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is funky flower, a condition that we,
again, just have on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the symptom here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an A type and a B type,
and this is the typical symptom of the A
[SPEAKER_05]: type in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we can see normal blossoms here,
funky A, funky B, and this is false
[SPEAKER_05]: blossom.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we do have some virus conditions to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are caused by a virus very similar
to cucumber mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stem canker gall is something that we will
see in Massachusetts some years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is caused by the very closely related
bacterium to what causes crown gall,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we hardly ever do see it, and it's
associated supposedly with winter injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: This symptom here is very typical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like upright dieback in the
field, and this seems to be more of a
[SPEAKER_05]: problem in Wisconsin than it is in the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I must mention parasitic nematodes because
we do sometimes have very high levels of
[SPEAKER_05]: this one in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemicycloofer, the sheaf nematode.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have anybody doing work on
nematodes in cranberries except for some
[SPEAKER_05]: spotty work on the West Coast at Oregon
State and in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may be more of a problem than we
realize they are and may impact yields in
[SPEAKER_05]: certain situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some valuable sources of
information that you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our cranberry chart book that we
put out of UMass here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year we renew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are currently working on the second
edition of the Compendium of Blueberry,
[SPEAKER_05]: Cranberry, and Lingonberry Diseases,
and we'll have it available to you
[SPEAKER_05]: sometime next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is currently going through the
editorial process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have this book that talks about
cranberry production as it is in
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts, but cranberry production
here is the same as it is anywhere they
[SPEAKER_05]: grow cranberries in many ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have any questions for Frank?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got through that beautifully and
certainly cranberries are really
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the good fortune to go on a tour
this summer of a cranberry bog and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might have a question coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was kind of like Tom Brady at the
beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: He couldn't hit Randy Moss and once he got
a good rhythm, he started hitting him time
[SPEAKER_02]: and time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom, organic cranberry production in the
East in Massachusetts and New Jersey is
[SPEAKER_05]: about as challenging as you can find
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have people doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have people that are doing it
successfully, but it's a constant battle,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially with insects and weeds and with
fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I won't say that you can't do it,
but it has about every challenge you could
[SPEAKER_05]: expect in the world thrown at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any additional comments before
we move to our next presenter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me, there's lots of discussion on
that one in New England this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very, very much for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry we got off to a rocky start.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should turn your mic off and I'm
going to introduce Anamique Shilder and
[SPEAKER_03]: change the presentations here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Shilder, I should have asked you,
I just turned on the shortened version and
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps that is not the one you wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had two versions, the shortened and
the regular one,
[SPEAKER_03]: Anamique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I think we can, the shortened version.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cut it back a little bit because of
the time constraints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me introduce you to the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Anamique Shilder is a professor of
plant pathology with Michigan State
[SPEAKER_03]: University in East Lansing, Michigan,
where she works to develop environmentally
[SPEAKER_03]: and economically sustainable methods of
disease control in small fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today she's going to be talking to us
specifically about blueberry viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Anamique, you can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like some people might think
you're a little bit loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if we should change here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you adjust to where it's comfortable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would go ahead with the volume
that they're at and hopefully they can
[SPEAKER_03]: adjust their own on their headsets or
their own audio levels on their computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I put myself to medium volume now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope it's not too loud then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'll get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much, Lara and Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being the guinea pig on this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope mine afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do, if you have any comments, yeah,
try to put them in the chat box so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try to check that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice that my presentation changed
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the slides look, well, to me,
they might look different from what I put
[SPEAKER_01]: together and I'm not sure what that is
about, but I think everything is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I will be talking about blueberry
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, they have been more of a
problem lately and the Michigan situation
[SPEAKER_01]: has been in the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has been an interesting summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to do is to give you an
overview of the viruses that affect
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are mostly prevalent in
Michigan and not in many other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought that you should be aware of
the symptoms just in case the symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: First question is, what is a virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: A virus is really quite different from
fungi and bacteria, which is what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: probably realized as people were talking
about the flu virus and how antibiotics
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work against flu viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a virus is really a very simple
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It consists of DNA on RNA, which is
genetic material, surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_01]: protective protein code.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to get the arrow going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pointer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the protein code and this would
be the genetic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are dependent on their host,
whether it's an animal or a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: for their reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question sometimes comes up is,
are they really alive or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are able to reproduce and infect
with the help of their host plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses are extremely small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only be viewed by an electron
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at this picture next here,
these are virus particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: These would be magnified 100,000 times for
you to see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are present in plant sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as small as they are, it's interesting
how much damage they can cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when a virus gets in a
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a virus, and I've drawn it as a little
vampire, but in reality, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a boring little particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it gets into the plant cell,
what happens is it takes off its protein
[SPEAKER_01]: code and it hijacks the cell machinery to
make copies of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cell will make copies of the virus
particle and of the protein code.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reassembles and then it gets out from
that cell and starts to spread throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once it is in the plant, it has to
redistribute to every cell of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could take a while, from several
months, maybe to a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the virus can also end up in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses do not have legs, even though
that's what I drew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't have a way to spread except
for vegetative propagation, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the main ways in which viruses spread
in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big, big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some viruses will spread through seed as
well as pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some viruses need aphids or other insects
to spread them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the insect will suck up the sap
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virus particles are in that and then it
will spit it back out into a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even mites and some nematodes are involved
in the spread of certain viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, viruses have very specific
relationships with their vectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like any insect can spread any
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quite specific situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So viruses can be hard to control because
once the plant is infected, it's infected
[SPEAKER_01]: for life and there is no cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be present in woody plants in a
symptomless state for several years before
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that there's something wrong with
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can even spread when the plants
are symptomless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's further complicated by the fact
that some viruses remain symptomless in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they still spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they get to a cultivar,
for instance, that's highly susceptible or
[SPEAKER_01]: will show the symptoms, then you get a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're pretty tricky in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some important points about viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, they most commonly
spread through vegetative propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to start with
virus-free planting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people either do not
know this or they feel, well, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a very good investment,
especially when you're working with a crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that could live 30 to 50 years,
maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each type of virus has a specific vector
or way in which it moves from plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there's insect vectors,
if you control the vector, you control the
[SPEAKER_01]: spread of the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a virus cannot be
positively identified by symptoms alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though some viruses are so
characteristic that you could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's probably that virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be absolutely sure, you need to do a
laboratory analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the test that is performed is akin to
a pregnancy test where you see a color
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction and then you know the virus is
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also some more advanced
DNA-based methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some nurseries sell virus-tested nursery
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they do that is that the
mother blocks from which the cuttings are
[SPEAKER_01]: taken are laboratory tested for viruses
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also based on visual inspection and
then, sorry, visual inspection and tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture alone do not guarantee freedom
from viruses because some viruses are
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomless.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I'll go through the most common
virus symptoms in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I think is most striking and
actually could be called beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for a plant pathologist looking
at those, is blueberry shoestring virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one has really characteristic
symptoms that almost cannot be mistaken
[SPEAKER_01]: for anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll see the oak leaf pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's reddening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see red blotches on the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is usually what you see at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the shoestring leaves,
which are very thin, straplike leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see that, that is very likely to
be blueberry shoestring virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This virus, in addition to being spread by
propagation material, is spread by aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to spread down the row because
aphids either walk from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier for them to walk down the road
and to cross rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because if there's mechanical
harvesting, the mechanical harvesters
[SPEAKER_01]: could pick up infective aphids and carry
them down the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transmissions usually start in spring when
aphids emerge and can continue until fall
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the spread will occur when
aphid populations explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that you could do to
control blueberry shoestring virus is to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor aphid populations and to use
insecticides, well-timed insecticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: including and washing harvesters after
harvesting in infected fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I talk about control measures
for specific viruses, I emphasize
[SPEAKER_01]: additional control methods to virus-free
or virus-tested materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the virus-tested plant material
goes for all virus problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato ringspot virus is actually a virus
that infects a lot of other hosts in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell that there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find that this virus is pretty
common in Michigan, probably in other
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, too, in New York, where you see
leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of spotting in the plants,
necrotic spots, and the leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: distorted along those spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a decline, a dieback of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's one or a few plants in the
area that are showing this dieback and
[SPEAKER_01]: slow decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco ringspot virus is another very
similar virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also looks quite similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the spotting on the leaves and the
leaves are deformed or curled,
[SPEAKER_01]: and infected bushes will decline and
eventually die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here we have a little problem with
the formatting of the slide, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: you can still read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these viruses have a wide host
range, which includes many weeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: dandelion, chickweed, and they can be
carried from, you know, from crop to crop
[SPEAKER_01]: by these weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they infect tree fruits,
apples, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you plant it after an orchard,
you might have a problem with this virus
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's transmitted by dagger
nematodes, Zephanema americanum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this nematode, which is a small round
worm that lives in the soil and feeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: plant roots, can transmit the virus and
even for a year after the crop has been
[SPEAKER_01]: removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have this virus, and again,
I would recommend testing or diagnosis
[SPEAKER_01]: first to be sure that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do remove infected bushes,
you should test the soil for the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of the dagger nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are present, there's a good
chance that they will then transmit the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus to the next planting or if you
replant in those same areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fumigation with a fumigant or rotating
out of blueberries for several years,
[SPEAKER_01]: planting, for instance, rye that will not
have the nematodes survive beyond,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that year, would be ways to
control that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maintaining good weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some resistant or tolerant
cultivars that can be planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry leaf model virus is another
virus that, as far as we know,
[SPEAKER_01]: only is found in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk about it briefly,
but just in case people start seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically you see yellowing or modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modeling means sort of a light and dark
green areas on leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stunting can occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are very small and rosetted and
more or less pointy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this virus disease does cause some
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes slow decline in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variety ruble especially declines more
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The control of this disease, sorry,
this disease or this virus, interestingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: is transmitted by pollen, which are
carried by bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you inadvertently get problems or the
bees will be carrying the pollen and the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, it's only known in
Michigan so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the control would be to remove and
destroy infected bushes and not moving
[SPEAKER_01]: beehives from infected fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just brings another aspect of certain
viruses diseases where bees are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in the transmission of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You place the hives and what you do with
the hives after pollination of the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another virus that is a common or not very
common, but it occurs in Michigan and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: also appears to become more problematic in
states like North Carolina is blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: red ring spot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just looking at the symptoms,
I think it's quite striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see red blotches on the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sometimes have a beautiful ring like
shape, but most of the time it's more like
[SPEAKER_01]: a blotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see red spotting on the
leaves that is only visible from the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the older leaves that start to
have this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may even be flecks on the fruit and
delayed ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a little bit of a problem
because I don't see my screen anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what just happened,
but this thing is doing things without me
[SPEAKER_03]: touching anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we back?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I thought I was doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fear was I was doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, I'll continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I hope I'm not running out of time or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the formatting has changed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, blueberry red ring spot virus
does not reduce yield significantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but delays ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not seem to spread in Michigan,
but in New Jersey, it appears to be
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted by mealybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the rare event that you start to see
this, you would have to monitor infected
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for spread and watch for mealybugs
in infected fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, blueberry mosaic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we don't actually
know is caused by a virus, but we suspect
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have found virus-like particles
in these plants, but it's still being
[SPEAKER_01]: studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't know for sure what virus
we have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty common, I think,
in many growing areas where you see this
[SPEAKER_01]: mosaic pattern where there is yellow and
green area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're reddish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the whole leaves could be
yellowish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not really very harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't think that it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sometimes looks like it's spreading,
but it could be that in cool years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just have more plants showing
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only known source is infected
plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really recommend control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if people were concerned, the recipe
would be the recommendation would be to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out that bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if it's advancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's switch to the viruses that have
really made my summer very, very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people I know are concerned about
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be, because especially this
blueberry scorch virus is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially damaging virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around in New Jersey for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called sheeppen hill virus in
that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The characteristic symptoms are sudden
blighting of the flowers and leaves during
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start to see a lot of flowers
altogether simultaneously blighting right
[SPEAKER_01]: before they open, that is potentially a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the leaves and the young shoots will
blight back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This disease is common in Oregon,
Washington, and British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_01]: also in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been found in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, so this year, we discovered it in
Michigan at several locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these locations or these fields were
destroyed to try and contain it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because since we don't know that this
disease exists anywhere else in Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want to protect our industry,
we had to go to this process of destroying
[SPEAKER_01]: the bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we could trace the infection
to a specific or two nurseries that had
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that were infected, but those had
been imported 14 years ago from actually
[SPEAKER_01]: from New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you later, but they were not
showing typical symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't know they were infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other symptoms of the blueberry scorch
virus are a yellowing or marginal leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: necrosis, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes some cultivars show red line
patterns in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see patterns like these,
this is really quite unusual and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: be concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are multiple strains of the virus
and the symptoms are strain-dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is what they call an east coast
strain and a west coast strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the west coast strain,
there are some cultivars which are
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can still serve as a reservoir of the
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you planted a symptomless cultivar,
you might start to see symptoms in
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that show symptoms with that
particular strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since then, they've discovered that
there are many more strains that really
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be studied because we don't know
all the reactions of these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mild symptoms that could easily be
overlooked and also could be confused
[SPEAKER_01]: with, say, nitrogen deficiency are,
for instance, in blue crop, a pale,
[SPEAKER_01]: pale green leaves in blue crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we had in Michigan was with a
variety legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only symptom that I could tell was
a yellowing of the leaves and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of strange red leaf,
you know, stripe patterns or line patterns
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the growers just thought the
plants weren't growing very well and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just thought they need to fertilize them
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see, I hope you can tell,
that the scorch infected legacy row,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was still a very young planting,
is much paler than this row next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only indication that you
would have had that it was infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other way was, of course,
to do the laboratory diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came through that almost 100% of
these plants were infected with the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry shock virus is very similar in
its symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here that you have also a very
simultaneous dieback of shoots as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: blossoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing as with scorch.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is a very different virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, there's a second flush
of leaves that occurs after these shock
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms have shown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that there are some live
leaves on these canes and that
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguishes it, for instance,
from formopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is possible to sometimes
confuse the symptoms with the mummyberry
[SPEAKER_01]: or with formopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This virus is common in Oregon,
Washington, and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, in 2009, we found one
site that had this disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at our research station.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know where it came from,
but it is possible that it came in with a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety trial that was planted or some
breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're currently trying to eradicate this
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in British Columbia or Pacific
Northwest, they find that the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: after several years of showing symptoms,
will come back to full production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be possible in Michigan as
well, but we don't know whether the virus
[SPEAKER_01]: would make the plants less winter hardy
and therefore perhaps more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over there, they are not so concerned
about blueberry shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scorch is the way more dangerous one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're just suggesting to growers
that they let the disease run its course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think we can do that because
we don't know what it would do in our
[SPEAKER_01]: regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you still have it in a small
contained area, the best approach is to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and eradicate it so that it doesn't
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this disease can spread very rapidly
because it also spreads via pollen carried
[SPEAKER_01]: by bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see an infected plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I want to point out
is that distinguishes a virus disease from
[SPEAKER_01]: other diseases is that you can see this
plant is showing a lot of necrosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of dieback of the shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the neighboring plants look perfectly
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see this very random pattern of
a plant here and there that has a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: blighting of leaves, I think that is what
is very indicative of a virus disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see maybe two next to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, if it is a fungal disease,
you would see symptoms on other bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Laura, that is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done with my talk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you suspect shock or scourge,
I would suggest that you contact your
[SPEAKER_01]: local extension agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mark the plants and take leaf
samples from several branches because the
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses may not be distributed very well
throughout the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can send them for diagnosis either
to a university laboratory or to Agdia,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a private lab, or AC Diagnostics
is another private lab that will test
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the samples should be as fresh as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more information on our Blueberry
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus the fact sheets or pest alerts that I
produced are available through the webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to download.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that will help you recognize
the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's no need to panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in many cases we have seen just a
very small area of infection that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: traced back to certain sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we have any widespread
occurrence, but we have to be alert or
[SPEAKER_01]: vigilant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I do have this table here
that would just show you the different
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses and their symptoms and their
vectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for the formatting change
that happened when I uploaded this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I didn't mention stunts because
that's not actually caused by a virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: but by a bacterial-like agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more information on stunts on
the website as well as in our virus fact
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any time, I'll entertain
some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One from Oneida County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can injury from herbicides give similar
appearance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the reasons why we did
not recognize that we had shock at our
[SPEAKER_01]: research station is because we had a lot
of roundup and so maybe some paraquat
[SPEAKER_01]: injury in our bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only difference would be that if
you have herbicides, it tends to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be a single bush here or
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's probably the main way
to try to distinguish them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: More information about viruses at the New
England Vegetable and Berry Conference in
[SPEAKER_03]: Manchester, New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that date is on the 15th of December.
[SPEAKER_03]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get right to their website for
registration information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I would like to add to that that
for anyone attending the Great Lakes Expo
[SPEAKER_01]: in Michigan, Bob Martin from Oregon,
who is sort of the virus expert in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries and other small fruits,
will be attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be talking about shock and
scorch as well at that meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's 8th to 10th, the 8th to the
10th in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so there's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you don't remove all of the roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the virus remain in the roots in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a possibility that while the
roots remain alive, that the virus remains
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to, if you had
infected plants, to kill them,
[SPEAKER_01]: apply an herbicide first before you pull
them out so that the roots are killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how this is going a little fast
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Michigan certification process
working well for nursery plants or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: possible that infected plants have slipped
through?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our nursery certification process
is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the one scorch case slipped
through because there are several reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that it was symptomless,
so it didn't initially give any indication
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't know that we had shock or
scorch in the state, so we didn't test for
[SPEAKER_01]: it until several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we started testing for it,
because we had also simultaneously had
[SPEAKER_01]: plant box virus, the blueberry testing was
relegated to the latter part of the season
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't, because the virus
concentration gets lower the later you get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had some suspect samples,
but they weren't sure that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: infected, so only this year did they
confirm that it really was infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants were imported by the
nursery 14 years ago, so they didn't sell
[SPEAKER_01]: any because they weren't growing well,
but they did slip through because we just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't test through a variety of
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think all the nursery plants are
tested for both of these viruses now,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it should be working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to catch up all the questions
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: How soon after removing can you replant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can replant if you're sure
that the roots are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can replant within even several
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it'd be good to plow up,
and depending on the virus, if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode-borne virus, you might have to
wait longer, at least a year, if it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those viruses like scorch or shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure that the insects are
all killed, if there's any transmission by
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should mention that for the scorch
virus, we don't know that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted, but transmitted by the aphid
that we have, which is Illinois pepperi,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's transmitted by Erycaphid species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the fields infected, did you test for
both scorch and shock since the symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: look alike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we tested for both because we didn't
know which one was which.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if they plan to record Bob
Martin's talk for later viewing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Great Lakes Expo, I don't think
they have actually recorded talks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have just put the presentation
online, or they have put some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: summary online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check into that to see if that's
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Frank's comment, if you have a
positive detection of scorch or shock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the New England State, I would like to
know.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should all be, you know,
I guess talking to each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: to know where these viruses occur,
because I can guarantee that once you
[SPEAKER_01]: start looking, there will be some places
where it will show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a lot of plant movement
before, you know, we were really aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: these viruses and some of it could have
been just moved, you know, or moved years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago and is infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it hasn't spread, hopefully,
but once we start looking, I think we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are nurseries required to test and certify
their stock as disease free?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a voluntary program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you buy plants, you have to ask or
be sure that it's virus tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some nurseries that have visual
inspections and they might say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it has been inspected for
diseases, but that doesn't mean it's virus
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to undergo a laboratory test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to confirm that with your
nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you or Frank have an opinion about
USDA's National Clean Plant Network?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am right now at the Berry Clean Plant
Network meeting in St. Louis and we are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on having, I guess, more virus
testing done and cleanup of planting
[SPEAKER_01]: material and also perhaps support
certification programs for more nurseries
[SPEAKER_01]: or states through this network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can, you know, it's still
developing, so, but they're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy, growers with blueberry virus
concern, contact Dr. Carrot Cox.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any way we can find out which
nurseries carried the infected plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I'm not at liberty to
divulge which nursery that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which carried the infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've worked on removing the
materials and contacting all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that might have purchased those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the best I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are contacted, the one thing I
can mention is that for the scourge in our
[SPEAKER_01]: area, it was the variety legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any concerns about,
you have legacy, not many people are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it, but some people are using it
as a pollinizer for liberty, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: late varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're finding that it's not growing
well, I would be, you know, looking into
[SPEAKER_01]: that and have it tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other comments?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to apologize to you folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly what happened today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some unusual things happen during
the presentation that I am not totally
[SPEAKER_03]: sure why or if they'll ever happen again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really appreciate Dr. Caruso and Dr.
Shilder's willingness to use this
[SPEAKER_03]: technology and the presentations were
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage you folks to, I'm going to
leave the website up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to continue to upload some
of the fact sheets about the presentations
[SPEAKER_03]: and if you want to go back and listen to
the archived version, that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are big issues right now,
so I just appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have one other question from
Tom Stevenson about what about vectors to
[SPEAKER_03]: be concerned about while growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I answer that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same vectors would be an issue
if you're growing organically or
[SPEAKER_01]: conventionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there would be less control in the
organic situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be concerned about vectors
unless you had a virus problem or maybe if
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbor had a virus problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that really in most cases,
viruses get transmitted by taking
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we have several growers in
Michigan who have said, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cut cuttings from my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, you know, that seems to be the
problem because the neighbor also had a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, some growers have noticed
that people have been taking cuttings from
[SPEAKER_01]: their planting at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, that could be a problem if you
have had a virus, be a problem for the
[SPEAKER_01]: thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any additional questions for Dr. Schilder
or Dr. Caruso?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, I'm going to officially end
this and stop the recording of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll leave it up here in case you want
to continue to download the fact sheets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate everyone's patience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to draw your attention to the
next webinar, which is on December 7th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a Wednesday at 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will be talking about site
preparation for blueberries and fertility
[SPEAKER_03]: and pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
