[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and so I emailed Simon just kind of
on a whim while I was in Indonesia jet
[SPEAKER_01]: lags and thought that it would be cool if
he was able to speak to our class and
[SPEAKER_01]: within the first email he agreed which was
really surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I thought maybe podcast
producers would be more intimidating when
[SPEAKER_01]: they are but they're very nice people too
and so he is very graciously agreed to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of talk about how Radiolab puts
together their podcasts and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: targets the general public but a lot of
their podcasts are on kind of current
[SPEAKER_01]: science trends or kind of philosophical
questions that kind of are pretty deep and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to repack them for a way
that the general public finds interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case some of you guys aren't aware
Radiolab in 2007 got the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Academies Communication Award for its
imaginative use of radio to make science
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to broad audiences and in 2010
and 2014 they got the Peabody Awards for
[SPEAKER_01]: their podcast which I'm pretty sure is
basically like the Oscars podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do a very good job and I'll pass
it over to Simon and mute ourselves now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right cool yeah good to be here good
to see all of your happy faces this
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah like I guess I'm more interested
in having a discussion than me lecturing
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything in particular but a little
bit about what we are what we do and what
[SPEAKER_00]: I do specifically for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah as was mentioned we're like a
radio documentary program so if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think like feature writing for a
magazine turned into the audio form or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a film documentary turned into the
audio form and particularly what we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is we try to find stories that are
filled with narrative tension so like any
[SPEAKER_00]: movie or television show that you watch
they're creating a story that makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to stick around makes you want to
listen to what's or watch what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not just that in our stories as well
we're trying to explore some question
[SPEAKER_00]: typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically through the characters or
through the individual story that we that
[SPEAKER_00]: were that we're telling so I think the
best example of that was a couple years or
[SPEAKER_00]: one of one example of this is I did a
story several years back profiling this
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas oil tycoon who also happened to be a
trophy hunter and essentially he went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Namibia here he paid three hundred fifty
thousand dollars and bought the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot an endangered rhino in Namibia and
essentially that story then is from like
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment he buys this thing through to
him shooting the thing exploring the
[SPEAKER_00]: question like okay on its face this guy
seems like a total asshole who is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible things for the world but is that
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes this exploration of what is
conservation in the 21st century and how
[SPEAKER_00]: do things is sort of unintuitive or ironic
is killing animals how does that feed back
[SPEAKER_00]: into protecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now specifically what I do here is I split
my time about 50-50 between being a
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter and being a producer so that
means half my time I'm reading calling
[SPEAKER_00]: people conducting interviews and then half
the time essentially I'm taking all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that tape that we get and turning it into
the thing that you hear and that's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long process where we'll do sort of draft
after draft after draft of the story until
[SPEAKER_00]: we think it gets to a point that we want
the world to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah that's a little bit of what I do
what we do and I guess yeah let's I open
[SPEAKER_00]: it up for questions or some sort of
discussion you guys can kind of direct
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want what you want out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay cool thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I was just wondering with
podcasts you only have like the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear like voice in them but like I guess
how do you find that I guess challenging
[SPEAKER_03]: or unique if you don't have written words
or any visuals or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well it's interesting it's why it
like writing for radio and storytelling in
[SPEAKER_00]: radio is obviously different than in other
forms and so a lot of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is take moves that are being done in
film or in in film documentary typically
[SPEAKER_00]: actually film we're looking to good
television shows or movies and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: like what are the storytelling devices
they're using and how can we sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate those in an audio in an just a
purely audio medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like an example of that is like a one
of my colleagues here was was watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening scene to There Will Be Blood which
is this just it opens up to this panoramic
[SPEAKER_00]: shot of I'm guessing it's Western Texas
and it then goes into this story of this
[SPEAKER_00]: man like picking at the ground trying to
find oil and so the question became like
[SPEAKER_00]: is there a way to create a sort of sonic
representation of a place like like it
[SPEAKER_00]: like a desert landscape and how do we do
that in a way that feels authentic to a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree also subtle and I think what ended
up being done was like there was some tape
[SPEAKER_00]: of somebody one of our reporters who is
out in the desert sort of walking through
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just hear them breathing and you
hear the wind blowing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and then like maybe a little
little bit of music comes in to nod even
[SPEAKER_00]: further to the fact that okay we're in the
southwest this is where this story is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take place the desert is a
character in and of itself in this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially it's a strange act of
translation from from one medium to
[SPEAKER_00]: another but like just as a practical note
one thing we're always trying to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: audio is give you the listener something
to look at which is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: counterintuitive but like we think of it
that we're making movies for your ears and
[SPEAKER_00]: in those movies like you got to be able to
see exactly what's happening and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we're you need to be able to imagine
exactly what's happening and we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: different sounds or we're using different
people voices or a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques which I could go into or not go
into to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question, I'm Kylie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Kylie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question going off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to the Black Rhino podcast and
there's a lot of background sounds just
[SPEAKER_03]: like put yourself into the mood whether it
was the auctioneer or they were going out
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually hunt down a rhino.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get those recordings without
recording like every step of your day or
[SPEAKER_03]: do you do that like how do you determine
what time do you bring out a recorder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm just always like we're just
always rolling and so yeah it's a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did a piece a couple months back
following this city council New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: Council candidate around for it was a
profile of this guy and I followed him
[SPEAKER_00]: around for about eight months and at the
end of it I had like a hundred or a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and twenty hours of tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was eventually cut down to an 80
minute story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah we're just like we're always
recording in the hopes that you that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can capture some tiny little moment that
that in fact captures the idea you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi I'm Kara.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like you're trying to be as
unbiased as possible when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: presenting these stories but how do you
keep that unbiased especially if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doctoring into some kind of story format?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if unbiased is the right way
to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we're telling a story
and a story inherently has a point of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it inherently has some sort of agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're manipulating you as the
listener in very specific moments to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific things or ask very specific
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's the actual craft of the
production process is like how can we take
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of mountain of tape and sculpt
it into something where you as the
[SPEAKER_00]: listener have an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we try to do is with
everyone we talk to to meet them
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously in a generous way where we
actually want to hear what they're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want to understand them but at the
same time in a very critical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's my job as an interviewer to
stand in for you the listener and ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: question that though it may be
uncomfortable in the moment is the
[SPEAKER_00]: question that needs to be asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess we're constantly we're
constantly forcing ourselves to stare
[SPEAKER_00]: logically at the things that people are
saying and see if they make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't make sense we're going
to tell you it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it does and we can't argue our way
out of it even if it feels wrong to us in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way we're going to present that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one thing I love about
the rhino hunter story is like here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: guy that you really hate at the get-go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sent you up to hate him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet at the end like if we did our job
right like you're you certainly you might
[SPEAKER_00]: like the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like him at least you
think he's reasonable whereas you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: thought he was off his rocker in the first
10 minutes of the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I don't know if it's about bias
or I think it's about just critically
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging with the ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you as the listener essentially as a
listener to a show like radio lab or this
[SPEAKER_00]: American life or any number of documentary
programs like you as a listener are saying
[SPEAKER_00]: like I trust you to manipulate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust you to play with my emotions in a
way that will be fair to me and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people you're presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I look at it and I try to I
try to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense or if you want to
clarify I can try.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Valerie how like what do you use before
you go into creating the podcast you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like a storyboard or like like a script or
how does it just kind of come naturally
[SPEAKER_02]: when you go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process is so let's say I go and
report a piece or a couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to be doing while I'm
reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is taking all that tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically an interview we do here is
about 90 minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take that 90 minute interview
and and cut it down to like a 20 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: set of selects as we call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of like the hot hot tape
from the from the interview as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a presentation of like the
arc of the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say after two months of reporting
I've done 10 interviews I've got 10
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews that are now cut down to 20
minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point I'm going to go back and
I'm going to listen to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My editors are going to listen to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have another producer who's going
to be working with me they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to everything everything meaning
the selects that we have cut from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes this sort of we call it a
storyboarding session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially like we just go around the
room telling each other what we think the
[SPEAKER_00]: story is like think we start so back in
2015 But then but but but but and so to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand as you got to back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just do that sort of around the
room over and over again until We start to
[SPEAKER_00]: land on a structure that sound that that
seems like it's going to work and by work
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like that we can do it with the
tape That it's honest Before most more
[SPEAKER_00]: than that that it that the emotional moves
that we're trying to make the ways we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make you feel we have the tape
to do it and Like what one thing that sets
[SPEAKER_00]: us apart from other shows is brief tangent
is just how much we lean on tape Like this
[SPEAKER_00]: American life for example, I would guess
70% of the of the words you hear in an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode are our track narration whereas I
would say in our episodes it's closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% or 40% But anyway, so once we have
what feels like a structure We lay that
[SPEAKER_00]: out on paper just super basic like the
basic beats of the story like we start
[SPEAKER_00]: here We meet this person here then this
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because of that the end and then
essentially it becomes this this game of
[SPEAKER_00]: Running into all of the problems that you
didn't predict When you built this
[SPEAKER_00]: storyboard or this roadmap for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously like you're It's never going
to translate perfectly You're never going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have foreseen all of the potential
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna run into When you're writing
that storyboard and so then we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly revising or trying new ways new
structures either macro or micro To
[SPEAKER_00]: present the ideas in an order that is both
compelling And hopefully informative So it
[SPEAKER_00]: like and I'll say like when an episode
that we do in most cases we go through
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20 or 30 iterations Like we remake
the episode 20 or 30 times before Never
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out So you're just guessing you're
constantly guessing until you get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: place that you that you feel like you've
landed in the right spot So what's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the average like You decide this is a
topic up for a podcast that you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: work on and then that final product Is
that is that like a year in the making or
[SPEAKER_01]: is that often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it totally totally totally varies I
would say on It's so hard to even give an
[SPEAKER_00]: average because like the episode we just
put out Essentially we threw together in
[SPEAKER_00]: three days, which we had never done Before
like prior to this the quickest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: we've ever turned around was a month But I
would say on average the stuff I work on
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I have worked on it's typically like
three months of reporting And then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at like a month or two months of
production So you're gathering your tape
[SPEAKER_00]: for three months and then you're making
the actual thing for two tip it like
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can be totally different than
that But that's some sort of average
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna pop in with one more Specific to
kind of the podcast that you guys do with
[SPEAKER_01]: related to the sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Guess in working with the scientists
first off is it is it tough to get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: commit to kind of taking a scientific
finding or Advance and technique and
[SPEAKER_01]: turning that into a story that are just
like in the sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your approach to kind of?
[SPEAKER_01]: take Chris, I mean your podcast on
crisper, let's say or something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: like What is your guys's approach to to
taking something that's very technically
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated and maybe a Scientist that is
very knowledgeable and turning that into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's digestible for the
general public and interesting Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And it's not just in sciences,
but in any interview I go into like you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to be dumb like you have to like
and you have to be really certain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things you don't understand that they're
saying so then you can clearly articulate
[SPEAKER_00]: a question that that answers that for you
because Yeah, a lot of times people are
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly if it's a if it's a technical
issue They're talking about it with it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fluency that nobody outside their
field has obviously so it's your job as
[SPEAKER_00]: the interviewer or as the producer to To
be the idiot in the room and force them to
[SPEAKER_00]: articulate it in a way that even The
dumbest person who's gonna be listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast Would be able to understand
And also so you can truly understand it
[SPEAKER_00]: because not only are we talking to these
people and using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Their voice to explain what the ideas are,
but we're intercutting our own voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to really clearly understand
Let's say I don't know like I keep coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the rhino hunter, but I I need to
actually understand the the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: Namibia's conservation policy to be able
to Talk about it in a in a in an educated
[SPEAKER_00]: let alone compelling way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really about you in the moment
Very very critically listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: person and then Quickly coming up with the
question that resolves the issue that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeling yourself have which is
which I think is just a great skill to
[SPEAKER_00]: have in general Yeah, just like being a
very very active listener And it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: about like knowing when you're bored like
that that's One thing that we're always
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do because we're trying to make
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting and fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're We're not gonna put something
out if it's not interesting and so it Part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the job is to also just know what I'm
interested in what I'm curious about what
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a modicum of wonder in and then to
chase that and It's through the act of
[SPEAKER_00]: very critical listening And like deep
critical awareness of of my own emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: states as I'm taking in information That I
that I'm able to then hone in on not only
[SPEAKER_00]: what I don't understand but what I do
truly find interesting So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a it's a deep act of listening
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so again it totally varies but I'd
say about like five to six months is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a decent average and so we've got
What like six to eight producers on staff
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment And a typical story is gonna
have two producers on it Sometimes more
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes less And so we're sort of always
trying to have three or four things at
[SPEAKER_00]: different phases of the production process
So that when we put one episode out it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not like we're starting back at square one
and having to do in two weeks all this
[SPEAKER_00]: work but rather We've got a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 50% Or 60% of the way sort of
produced and then it becomes like
[SPEAKER_00]: polishing at the end those last two weeks
that very rarely happens and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly Sprinting to try to find the
next thing or sprinting to try to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that needs to come out next But
yeah in a perfect world it's like this
[SPEAKER_00]: machine that has different Different
stories moving at different paces through
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of the production process
But yeah, it's a shit show most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: time Hi, I'm Chelsea quick question about
kind of cutting down the interviews that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about if you have hours and
hours of interviews you're cutting them
[SPEAKER_03]: down to 20 minutes kind of how do you do
that and decide what portions of the
[SPEAKER_03]: interview you want to keep and kind of how
do you maintain kind of the integrity of
[SPEAKER_03]: what whoever you're interviewing what
they're saying Yes, so there are a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think when you cut down an interview
from 90 minutes to 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're sort of two competing Two
competing goals that that you have one is
[SPEAKER_00]: to Preserve the character of the person as
much as possible And by that I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean what they said but sort
of how they said it there giggles there
[SPEAKER_00]: the moments where they pause to think if
they're if like you as The interviewer
[SPEAKER_00]: have a nice back-and-forth a rapport with
the person that's important to capture and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain And then the other thing you're
trying to do is you're trying to cram in
[SPEAKER_00]: as much information into those 20 minutes
as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different ideas as you can
and it's a it's an impossible balance in
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're always gonna Feel like stuff
that you left on the cutting room floor
[SPEAKER_00]: should have needed into that little
20-minute cut But the act of keeping them
[SPEAKER_00]: both both those Priorities in your head as
you're moving through the tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the best way to approach it
and how I do it is Take a 90-minute
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listen through it from beginning to
end the first time and I'm literally
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and pulling down the moments I
like very liberally so typically after my
[SPEAKER_00]: first pass through a 90-minute interview
I'll have about 40 minutes of tape that I
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled is my favorite parts my favorite 40
minutes and then from there what I do is
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sort of go through in and listen
through it for Front-to-back again and
[SPEAKER_00]: start reordering things because what often
happens in in an interview Is you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of the same ideas repeated
throughout different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview or even in quick succession and
so if I Don't know what what's an example
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was talking with these content
moderators in the Philippines Folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially it's their job to if you flag
something on Facebook as inappropriate It
[SPEAKER_00]: gets sent to Manila and somebody sitting
behind a computer then has that image come
[SPEAKER_00]: across them and they have to click Yes,
this is inappropriate or no, this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like throughout the course of my
interview with this guy I I like came at
[SPEAKER_00]: him four times with essentially variations
of the same question like but so what does
[SPEAKER_00]: it look like in your office?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm trying to actually imagine when
you're sitting at your computer what this
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like So throughout the 90 minutes,
that's so that question is speckled
[SPEAKER_00]: through after I've pulled the 40 minutes
of tape down I start rearranging things so
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Like okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are my four takes of the guy
answering this question Maybe the four
[SPEAKER_00]: takes add up to a total of four minutes
long, but he kind of says the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: each time I'm gonna be able to cut that
down To a minute or a minute and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of scrambling together the best
versions of him explaining that and So
[SPEAKER_00]: after going through the second time you've
reordered things Then you just start
[SPEAKER_00]: packing stuff down and you can usually get
it down to 20 minutes Like it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing in a 90 minute conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't this oft times you don't
actually need that much more than 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to get the May Like the majority
of the substance of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Hope that's not true with what I'm
saying right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping if it would be hard to get it
done
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so like the reporting process or like
the ideation like how do we come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: with stories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Yeah, it's really hard Because
they're like for something to work as a
[SPEAKER_00]: radiolab story and this isn't true of all
Podcasts or documentary programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it had there are a certain number
of boxes that need to be checked like you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to have a character you have to have a
character that had something interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to them and Then that interesting
unexpected thing that happened to them has
[SPEAKER_00]: to lead to some Unexpected interesting
consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's box one and that's sort of
near the the building blocks or the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of the narrative tension that I
talked about before like you need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something happen that causes something to
make you give a damn about whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell this person has experienced on top of
that then like they have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell their story in an interesting way so
that you feel like you can emotionally
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with them And then on top of that
like there has to be as I said before like
[SPEAKER_00]: a question that you're exploring and you
need to have Like you you need or I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to articulate very clearly like
I want to do this story because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about bop bop bop bop And so there
are various ways you can approach Trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to check all those boxes or finding
something that checks all those boxes one
[SPEAKER_00]: is I come up with a question on my own
that I'm like, oh, I'm really curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about Like content moderation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why is it such a hard problem
to solve?
[SPEAKER_00]: the misinformation The rampant
misinformation on these social media
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms Why is that such a hard problem
to solve and that led me to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a bunch of people who are thinking
about this and doing this and and are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to solve it and could explain it to
me and Through that I bumped into people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a story like the one I mentioned
before that something strange happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then they do something strange in
return the other way is you just Like you
[SPEAKER_00]: just You can start with a character like
you find somebody who's interesting like
[SPEAKER_00]: the the piece I did about the city
councilman like a year before I even
[SPEAKER_00]: started reporting that piece I reached out
to the guy because I had read an article
[SPEAKER_00]: about him and I thought he was interesting
and we Like would get coffee every couple
[SPEAKER_00]: months and then from there as your report
once I started reporting out the story
[SPEAKER_00]: It's figuring out what is the question
that I'm actually exploring through this
[SPEAKER_00]: but in essence like a At its most basic
it's just about input like you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be talking to a lot of people
you have to be Just sort of aware you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're trying to soak up as much of
the world as you can to then be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out or feel what in all of that
mess is the most interesting or the most
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing to you But like if I'm if I have
a day where I'm just reporting And by
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting I mean like looking for a story
if I'm if I'm hunting for stories I have
[SPEAKER_00]: just have sort of a checklist that I go
through like I'd need to read five
[SPEAKER_00]: articles I need to make two phone calls
and I need to schedule two more phone
[SPEAKER_00]: calls And if I do that It becomes a
numbers game and if I do that enough days
[SPEAKER_00]: in a row I know I'm eventually gonna
stumble into something that gets me
[SPEAKER_00]: excited But it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, do you mind sorry, I don't mean to
interrupt but can you talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: louder?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't quite hear you Yeah, sorry the
question is like how do who How do you get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to agree to talk and then how do
you sort of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them comfortable throughout the
interviewing process to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you want to talk about Okay
Yeah, it's weird it's a It totally depends
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends on who they are it depends on
what they're Why they're feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: ambivalent about whether they want to talk
to you or not in the first place And then
[SPEAKER_00]: for me it's it's about Getting out in
front of those concerns that they have and
[SPEAKER_00]: To a degree convincing them in a way that
is slightly manipulative, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: maliciously manipulative that they should
talk to you So for example, there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy Judd Hoffman who was Facebook's head
of global policy He was the guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially wrote the rule book for what
is allowed to be on Facebook guy with a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of power guy with a story that I think
is fascinating and that I haven't heard
[SPEAKER_00]: many people talk about like this is the
guy I want to get and we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful phone call together like I don't
even bring up the possibility of Talking
[SPEAKER_00]: on the record and then at the end of this
hour and a half on the phone I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: so by the way, would you be comfortable
talking on the record?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like could be sort of have this
conversation again, but record it And he
[SPEAKER_00]: says like I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've really enjoyed this conversation
I'm just like I'm worried that I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: look like I'm Monday morning
quarterbacking here If I talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook's doing and more than that like
the company I work for now and he worked
[SPEAKER_00]: for Pinterest He was worried that they are
going to like he doesn't want what he says
[SPEAKER_00]: about Facebook to in any way hurt
Pinterest and So what I did was I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I totally understand that If nothing
else can we just plan to talk again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure I'll have more questions
off the record and he says sure get shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email with some times to talk And so
then what I do is I spend like two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours crafting an email Where in the
first paragraph I set up I propose some
[SPEAKER_00]: time to talk but then like the real heart
of it is like This is I'm pitching him on
[SPEAKER_00]: why he should go on the record and I'm
addressing point-by-point the issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: he had when not wanting to do so and
obviously doing so in a in a transparent
[SPEAKER_00]: way like like winking at the fact that I'm
pitching you on this and I know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that I'm trying to get you to do
something you don't want to do But really
[SPEAKER_00]: just leveling with them and I guess when
I'm trying to get people to talk on the
[SPEAKER_00]: record in general I'm trying to use
transparency and authenticity As a tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: get people to talk Which is sort of an odd
thing because It's not particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic to use authenticity in a
calculated way, but it works And then as
[SPEAKER_00]: to like Being on the record with someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this weird act of sort of feeling it
out in the moment Because the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: the people don't that people don't want to
talk about are typically the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the most interesting so it becomes
this game of you like walk the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation closer and closer to whatever
the question is that you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask and then you feel them sort of bristle
so you back up and you move somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else, but then again you push back on it
and then in the last 20% of the interview
[SPEAKER_00]: is like Hopefully you've warmed them up to
the idea of talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they try Trust you a bit at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you are trustworthy at that
point and Yeah, you just got to sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: hit them with the question The story that
really relates to me and when you say that
[SPEAKER_00]: do you mean Yeah, I guess what can you
clarify the question a little bit like
[SPEAKER_00]: like one that resonated emotionally with
me or Yeah, what exactly what exactly do
[SPEAKER_03]: you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well like I guess what what I'm I'm
lucky in that my job Like every story I go
[SPEAKER_00]: after is because I'm actually curious
about some aspect of it and occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to Help produce a story for
someone else that I'm not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in but I think every story I've
certainly every story I have I've reported
[SPEAKER_00]: was Was personally meaningful in some way
because I just got to learn a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfy a genuine curiosity Recently I did
a story that I got to do with my dad,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really fun So like that just on
a very personal level was very It was very
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying and it was just cool to hear
his voice on the radio But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like hopefully like whatever field
you all end up going into like hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing does satisfy you
both intellectually and emotionally
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully on like a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what everybody should be
striving for and I I'm very Lucky and that
[SPEAKER_03]: my job does that for me So Simon this is
Chris as a faculty instructor of the class
[SPEAKER_03]: here I'm confident that every single one
of my students is dying to ask you this
[SPEAKER_03]: question Okay You know the classes skills
for public engagement and we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: talking a lot about audiences And you need
to know your audience when you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: engage with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you guys Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting question I'm trying to figure
out how honest to be here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even that question was planned by me
to make you trust me more I It's really
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say two ends of the spectrum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right one end of the spectrum is we do
have an audience and it is reliably
[SPEAKER_00]: college-educated and Reliably liberal or
at least skews democratic We know that
[SPEAKER_00]: about our audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they want to hear And we know
sort of how far we can push them So we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of always keeping that in mind like
we want to challenge the audience Within
[SPEAKER_00]: reason because we challenge them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're can be Backlash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come off sounding tone-deaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that calculation being made of
like we got we got a We can't do too much
[SPEAKER_00]: here But at the same time there's sort of
the Miles Davis approach which when Miles
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis in his later years would play like
he'd go up on stage and he would instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of having a microphone in front of him
looking out at the audience that he'd play
[SPEAKER_00]: into you have a microphone like on the
ground at the back of the stage and he
[SPEAKER_00]: just turned his audience or turn his back
to the audience and Play into his
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone sort of saying fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do my thing if you want to
listen to it you can't and so there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a There's like a swagger to that
and there's a confidence that like what I
[SPEAKER_00]: find interesting Will be interesting to
people That clearly if you do that too
[SPEAKER_00]: much you're gonna come across as an
asshole and you probably are an asshole
[SPEAKER_00]: but like there there's A degree of that
that needs to that needs to be inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: you as well When we're when you're
figuring out what it is you want to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: six months of your life So like sort of
love the audience but forget about the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience I think is one way we think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know if that's applicable to what
you all do may push back on me if you
[SPEAKER_03]: think I'm totally wrong Yeah, yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I'll sort of go back to one
of my earlier Answers and just say like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's being able there's a confidence
in being able to be stupid in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: very smart people and To be able to be
stupid in a very smart way to know when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not quite articulating themselves
well enough for the average person to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to hear and for you to be able to
jump in and say like whoa, sorry I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you saying it this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this what you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this what you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuz I'm not quite sure and that again is a
is a Can only happen when once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: really developed an ability to listen
critically so being a being a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Going off of that answer because you
do do a lot of research before you go into
[SPEAKER_03]: your interview What you've been saying so
usually are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of playing double bad get like to
actually Kind of in some know what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to say but trying to get them to
just articulate it better And when you do
[SPEAKER_03]: that, have you I guess not come across as
fake Yeah, good question I'm totally
[SPEAKER_00]: playing that like I I don't know if I'd
I've I Don't know if I would use the term
[SPEAKER_00]: playing devil's advocate, but but
certainly I'm making arguments that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't agree with At times to push someone
to more clearly articulate their argument
[SPEAKER_00]: or I'm even Off times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing dumb when I understand
something or it's as strange It's as small
[SPEAKER_00]: a thing is like well, I'm saying something
like I hear that they bumped the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone I might say like sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't quite understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you say that again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so we have like a clear piece of tape
of them saying it And as far as like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a way that doesn't feel over-the-top
or performed Like I think at least for me
[SPEAKER_00]: like I approach interviewing as a sort of
active performance like I am a different
[SPEAKER_00]: person when I'm interviewing than I am in
the rest of my life I don't think I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a version of myself like it's a
slightly more heightened version more
[SPEAKER_00]: excited version or more easily excited
person And and as far as like do I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're going to say when I enter the
room I I'll often have a good idea and if
[SPEAKER_00]: I do then that gives me some lead time and
prior to the interview to to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare a list of counter arguments for
What I expect them to say But at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time like you don't want to At least sort
of ethos here is you don't want to prep
[SPEAKER_00]: too much because you want to be able to
have an actual genuine back-and-forth with
[SPEAKER_00]: the person and be present and allow
yourself to think through something with
[SPEAKER_00]: them in any given moment, so Yeah,
it's it's a I think it's something you can
[SPEAKER_00]: only learn by doing and sort of dialing
dialing yourself in and how how you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in that space which is a totally
Unsatisfactory answer and I'm sorry about
[SPEAKER_01]: that Okay real quickly Geneva just popped
in with a question that they wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaborate on training specifically Yeah,
the question is like how did I how did I
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to do some of this stuff Like
particularly critical listening And okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I didn't I didn't study journalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no background in journalism I
didn't I when I was 20 22 I was living
[SPEAKER_00]: down in South America Working at a couple
restaurants just trying to master the
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish language And while I was doing
that I realized like what the hell am I
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do with my life?
[SPEAKER_00]: And felt like you know, I like to write I
listened to a lot of public radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had played in bands So I understood
audio to a degree And so I decided like
[SPEAKER_00]: well, let's move somewhere new in Latin
America And just try being a reporter for
[SPEAKER_00]: the freelance reporter And I knew that
there were interesting things going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: Venezuela and that nobody or very few
English speaking reporters were there so I
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to Venezuela and Just started
pitching places Like going out trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find stories pitching those story ideas to
different editors until I eventually got
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up by the BBC's The World And from
there I moved to Ireland I did that again
[SPEAKER_00]: Working for an English speaking German
radio show And then from there I got I got
[SPEAKER_00]: an internship here at the show So like
what what can be learned from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important thing is just
to start like if you if and not not that
[SPEAKER_00]: you all want to be journalists,
but just like you just have to start
[SPEAKER_00]: making stuff You just have to start doing
stuff and don't wait for somebody to don't
[SPEAKER_00]: wait to get permission don't necessarily
wait to have all Of the skills before you
[SPEAKER_00]: start just you're gonna learn stuff as
you're probably gonna learn things more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly potentially by just doing them So
there's that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I showed up to the show here
and was totally like out of my depth like
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that in not just a journalistic
way, but like I grew up in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a great education I went to a
state school in Oregon for college and
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly I'm with all these Ivy League
assholes who think super fast and And are
[SPEAKER_00]: just way better read than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like this three years of
Just educating myself so that I could even
[SPEAKER_00]: have conversations with people And so
again like there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-education there And I was surrounded
by really as you all clearly are really
[SPEAKER_00]: smart thoughtful people Who were patient
with me and helped me along the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think they're all very
learnable skills, I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of Yeah, I don't know if there's
an innateness to it at all the only other
[SPEAKER_00]: one more thing I will say is I think the
way I learned and I didn't even know I was
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to be an interviewer But the way
I learned how to interview was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: hitchhiked a bunch in college And when
you're hitchhiking like you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the passenger seat and you have
nothing to do but talk to the person And
[SPEAKER_00]: they're giving you a ride so to a degree I
felt sort of indebted to them and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay them back was by asking them
questions about like who they are what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were up to and I think I honed that
skill in those long Car rides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I suggested people do that
or not, but it works
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Yeah, I know the biggest one was
this episode that we put out called truth
[SPEAKER_00]: trolls Which got pulled down which we
ended up retracting and essentially it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the story of 4chan trolling Shia LaBeouf
and this art project he was doing and how
[SPEAKER_00]: through incredible wit perseverance and
Critical thought they were able to locate
[SPEAKER_00]: Where this where this flag was located
knowing nothing more than a Livestream
[SPEAKER_00]: video of the flag and it's an incredible
story like it in and of itself the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that these guys managed to pull this off I
think is it's incredible now clearly Where
[SPEAKER_00]: we failed was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't articulate clearly enough that
there are a lot of bad actors on 4chan and
[SPEAKER_00]: that It's even possible that some of the
guys who ended up doing this were those
[SPEAKER_00]: bad actors
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that reason and also in part
because the episode came out like the day
[SPEAKER_00]: before Charlottesville so suddenly the
national conversation and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: national mood changed in this Very dark
way and rightfully so it just it even felt
[SPEAKER_00]: to us that what we had done was tone-deaf
What I what I think was important about
[SPEAKER_00]: that piece and what I Continuing to strive
to do despite and this this sort of comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pushing the audience is like I
think that bad what a quote bad people It
[SPEAKER_00]: can still have rich complicated
interesting lives and that just because
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think you can you can present
someone's story without glorifying the
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible views that they might have and
that's a really hard thing because like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always gonna be a good portion of
the audience who thinks Like you just
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't even give this person a platform
which like I'm happy to have that argument
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think whoever someone who Articulate
that like they have plenty of good
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments they could use But I guess my
like a principle I have is like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: better to see other people as human than
not and if I can find a an iota of
[SPEAKER_00]: humanity and someone it It's not only
worth presenting, but I think it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: just deeply interesting But yeah,
that was one that we we missed the mark on
[SPEAKER_01]: in several ways And we acknowledged yeah,
we fucked up So,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, this was super interesting and I'll
send you a follow-up email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I got to get some paper permission
to post the recording Cornell policy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but Yeah, no, this was this was
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I don't think all ivy leaguers
are assholes All right, talk to you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: later You You You You You
