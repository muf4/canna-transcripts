[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Myers will be talking about the
Woodland Acres Farm Organic Grain and Hay
[SPEAKER_02]: Journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Scott Myers is in partnership
with his father, Fred, operates the third
[SPEAKER_02]: generation Woodland Acres Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and his wife, Nicole, and their four
boys live on the farm in Dalton,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started farming full time with his
father in 2001 and has since grown their
[SPEAKER_02]: farm into a diverse organic hay and crop
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott holds a bachelor's degree from the
Ohio State University in Agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: Economics with a minor in crop science.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been an active participant in the
Ohio Ecological Food and Farming
[SPEAKER_02]: Association's backed Ohio Soil Health
Initiative, the Farm Bill Climate Work
[SPEAKER_02]: Group, and the Crop Insurance Work Group,
and he serves as the chair of the policy
[SPEAKER_02]: committee on the Organic Farmers
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woodland Acres Farm raises certified
organic hay, barley, wheat, oats,
[SPEAKER_02]: cereal rye, corn, sunflowers, peas,
and soybeans on around 2,500 acres in
[SPEAKER_02]: Wayne County, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his farm has been certified with OEFFA
since 2016 and also holds a real organic
[SPEAKER_02]: certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scott, thank you so much for being
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, yeah, I'm Scott Myers,
Woodland Acres Farm, and I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through some things we do on our farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been certified organic since 2016,
and we kind of hit on just about
[SPEAKER_05]: everything we did on the day, almost
everything that we've talked about already
[SPEAKER_05]: today, we have done or do currently on our
farm, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to sound an expert on
anything, but I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right here, and we'll go through this
and talk a little more about some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: graphs, some of the questions that I get
as I talk to different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try to dig in a few of
those specific things to go through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you see things in here that I don't
touch on, please talk to me later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be around the rest of the day
because there's, as some of you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can talk about a lot of different things
that we've tried and lots of different
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge on a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, this is us, no-till and rye,
or no-till and rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually it's, I tell everybody it's
no-till and soybeans, but because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: question we had earlier about raising
sunflowers in no-till and rye,
[SPEAKER_05]: I will admit I'm actually no-till and
sunflowers in this field, and it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: total failure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and what we found was,
so we actually came back to no-till and
[SPEAKER_05]: peas a month later, what we found was
slugs like sunflowers better than they
[SPEAKER_05]: like corn and they like soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually, total random, made two passes
with soybeans on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: field because we still had beans left,
and the beans were perfect to the row,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the next row over, we might have had a
5% stand, and I've never seen slugs take
[SPEAKER_05]: that problem as fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my take on that question we made
earlier about sunflowers was that people
[SPEAKER_05]: get the slug issue, so I'd say it's what
we found.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so moving on, this is a bit of
an overview of our own farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually the third generation that
farms with my father.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually looked about one organic back
in the 80s, right, when I was five years
[SPEAKER_05]: old, one of the first organic farms in
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you may have heard of the spray
brothers, the Rex and Howard spray that
[SPEAKER_05]: are not burning in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember going there with my father on
field days, five years old, and seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: this farm, and I was kind of odd,
they were game farmers with the last name
[SPEAKER_05]: S-D-R-A-Y.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a weird coincidence, I guess,
but it's kind of neat that we almost did
[SPEAKER_05]: that, but we didn't make that jump,
and then, oh, about 12, 13 years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: we decided to begin our journey into
organic, and never look back, and
[SPEAKER_05]: basically our entire department was
certified.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like I said, father-son operation,
my wife told us she had a big trip over
[SPEAKER_05]: with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had four boys, they're almost 16,
the youngest is nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all love the farm, whether they come
back to the farm or even make sure that
[SPEAKER_05]: they at least have the opportunity if they
want to, but it's great, they enjoy the
[SPEAKER_05]: organic farming part of it, and they're
very, it's interesting to see them talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: their friends and go to places,
as we point out, organic food is a thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's really a half and half set of
young generation farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we own about 500 acres in there,
or main county, and then we ran another
[SPEAKER_05]: 2,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say 40 different landowners actually
ended up the other day, it's actually 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of where we live, we have a lot of
our land that hasn't been sold,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's split up, and so the last year,
we actually didn't add any more acres,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we added 10 more landowners on farms
that sold and split into four pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we deal with that on a regular basis,
it is a struggle in our organic effort,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we have tried to make that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are spread out over about 25 miles,
and we do see that always have a gravity
[SPEAKER_05]: transition as we rent more land.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as we run new farms, I would say to
start that process, we always start at the
[SPEAKER_05]: pay or the fund.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's our farm mission statement,
it just basically says that what we
[SPEAKER_05]: believe in, and that's what we try to
invest, that's one of the things right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, these are our crops, he ran these,
I'm not going to go through each one of
[SPEAKER_05]: them, but they're there, but we're going
to talk about most of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a picture of my grandfather at 14,
I believe, following way back in the,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we should ask again when
that goes from, but I don't want to throw
[SPEAKER_05]: that up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are our crop rotations, and they're
very, that's like the hardest thing that
[SPEAKER_05]: when I do my OSB and we're working on
currently on regenerative organic
[SPEAKER_05]: certification, they ask, it's like they
want this instead of what is your,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is your propagation, what do you have
all the time?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's so many things, because we
have so many different crops, there's so
[SPEAKER_05]: many different variations on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for instance, we are in the hay
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the hay business since I came
back from Ohio State on the farm,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was how I got started, and one point
we had, it was looking at our acres of
[SPEAKER_05]: hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sell hay, we live in the number one
dairy county in Ohio, we sell hay locally,
[SPEAKER_05]: most of our hay saves up to 50 pounds of
hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are really fortunate on top of the fact
that we live in a great dairy county,
[SPEAKER_05]: we also live in the second largest
concentration of organic value dairies are
[SPEAKER_05]: within 50 miles of our base, the first
largest most times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those dairies that are grazing all need
to be ending all winter long, and we had a
[SPEAKER_05]: fantastic press month that we were going
to monitor the basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll talk a little more about the hay,
but the hay is basically the basis for all
[SPEAKER_05]: of our crop rotations, except a few fields
that just, you know, raise hay with a
[SPEAKER_05]: green field at the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we like to go from hay to corn,
that's our symbol of rotation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that also a big Amish county?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our main county is the south,
that's one of the worst population of
[SPEAKER_05]: Amish in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have actually a lot of Amish
landowners and a lot of Amish farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So corn, for us, is one of the easiest
things to go after hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a lot of times, we will go in the
spring and eat, we'll talk about it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit, a little later, with clover
under seeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we actually will go from spring
to winter sometimes, and then back to hay,
[SPEAKER_05]: depends, but you know, we'll talk about
sunflower, so I mean, there's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just such a varied rotation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not one rotation I have figured
that works perfectly on every field,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of doing specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing we will talk about when we
get to the neutral soybeans, about why we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't do neutral soybeans very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nutrients, these are our main
nutrients, we're a big believer in gypsum.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have an open standing order
with a charming company that brings us
[SPEAKER_05]: mine gypsum from up in Michigan,
pretty much year round, and now sit under
[SPEAKER_05]: storage, because we put 500 tons of gypsum
every single year, no matter what crops in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want, we have five great soluble
acid levels, and soluble nutrient levels
[SPEAKER_05]: in our soils as high as we can,
because we found that we control these
[SPEAKER_05]: very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are in gypsum.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other product that we see,
well, obviously chicken, we spread a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of chicken in there, another unique thing
about our area, we don't own hay chickens
[SPEAKER_05]: on our barn, but the farms that we have
all chicken in there, from chicken house
[SPEAKER_05]: to fields, four of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have fields with many, many
different chicken growers, and 75% of them
[SPEAKER_05]: there is from organic land.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a lot of green 50,000 that we
keep them cleaned out, they pile in the
[SPEAKER_05]: end, and we heard that we immediately were
to pile these for storage and spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really fortunate in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: This other product here is a newer product
for us, it's bone meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is produced locally there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually produced about a month away,
comes with chains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's super high in nitrogen,
and it's super high in phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_05]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nitrogen is why we're using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just use Chilean Nitrate, I personally
spy Chilean Nitrate because it's sodium
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting sodium on the soil is not good for
soil well, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to be careful how we use that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other reason I don't like Chilean
Nitrate, personal opinion, and I have no
[SPEAKER_05]: basis for this, other than I know it's an
important thing when it comes to Chile,
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some day they might come out and
say, oh, look, there are children.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what your response is for
that or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, on the gypsum, we do not fly gypsum
in the fall because it will leach.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to keep that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to do it all in the spring,
in the sense that in situations of hay,
[SPEAKER_05]: we either get it the first day,
and only places it gets qualified would be
[SPEAKER_05]: on the winter crops, like wheat,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in the case of corn, so we need to be
trying to get it in the top edge of the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be right before maybe that
last fully passed or right on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is to get the soluble calcium on
the top edge of the soil as high as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So look, that's kind of the issues we use.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's hobby spread, the gypsum,
bone-yolk spread, just put the standard
[SPEAKER_05]: fertilizer on our spread, the combination
spreader.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both go through there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we do some foliar feeding and
liquid in-row cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to do a lot more foliar feeding
than I do now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see as big of a benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think part of that is because as we thin
in organic corn, our soil has become
[SPEAKER_05]: biologically active, and we just don't see
the benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still need to be putting in-row
fertilizer, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm starting with mold therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, that's what we do on foliar
when we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't always do it then.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see the biggest benefit on small crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, raising protein levels to meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we see a real big benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This nutrition end is involved in
biological.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is approved in organic production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while it will work in corn,
and I've seen it work in corn,
[SPEAKER_05]: we see it work on a consistent basis in
small crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had a year where it has not
paid us back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially since, once again, if you want
high protein in your small grains and your
[SPEAKER_05]: wheat, you need to have in-row.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in-row, we want to get our corn and
soybeans off there in a really quick
[SPEAKER_05]: start.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want them to beat the weeds out of the
ground, as fast as they can get out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we do use in-row, that's what we're
using with grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: This SPE120 that you see towards the
bottom there, that's a biosimulant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very important one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found out about this when we first came
out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We deal with a lot of them in apple box.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, you might try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have studies done yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might help with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helps with just root health and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use it first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 10 push-limits on crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't get that here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some years we get an increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some years we don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started using that six years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've not had any issues with phytoxin or
apytoxins on any crops that we use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use it on everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seed applied, or it can also be put in
liquid on a seed too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use in-row, then in-row,
just for seed corn magic control and
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We only try to use it in the soil and in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go through some of the tillage
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see a lot of foot coming
out here and things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do still do some more work on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found the best way to take any field
that's been in hay, out of a bunch of silt
[SPEAKER_05]: shallows in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like to deep root those
extensions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we like to get some rows in the spring
before we file it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because basically, you've got a very,
very similar tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pure nitrogen coming from hay
producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that stuff's 23%, 25% protein,
if I was going to fail that, that is pure
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will be very readily available when
you file that up here, doing that phone
[SPEAKER_05]: call.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we let that stuff in on foot calls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it will call or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see our clover, red clover,
which we use after wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably actually going to start it
off seeding next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way the weather looks in Ohio should
be perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we shall file that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or sometimes we'll use our one-pin as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love our high-speed disc, but it's so
good to bend.
[SPEAKER_05]: One year, we'll use it a whole month in
spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next year, we might have wetter
conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll file it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, very specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: So soil shredding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to think we didn't need a soil
shredder.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Lemkin, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes you come across it out of
control.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get them shredded down so that
that Lemkin can work better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even on a bottle, you need to get it down
to the bottom all year to get it to this
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing we love to do with our
clover is our frost-heated clover.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try not to make that for hay,
because we're moving in on nutrients off
[SPEAKER_05]: of our making hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we have frost-heated clover,
we want to mow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it stimulates the roots to grow and
make more nutrients for the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll actually go in every 35 days on
that clover and soil shred it,
[SPEAKER_05]: shred it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it works really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just regrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just basically like you're making hay
out of that, it's actually shredded into
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just basically a fantastic soil
to make sure you're moving the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing we've not heard much about
today is when we we ended up probate
[SPEAKER_05]: playing witter four years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first couple of years,
a little scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first couple of times you've been
playing with corn, you may look pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm going to go to the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we played with a little clover.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this one on your labs, that would
be within about six hours after you've
[SPEAKER_05]: been playing, maybe a little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neighbors, they all joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: After three days after, go ahead and kill
the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they come back and do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He killed the corn again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have one neighbor, he doesn't,
he swears.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is usually the next day, maybe two
days later.
[SPEAKER_05]: This last view, this is five days later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're trying to do is basically
sterilize the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can kill all the little weeds that
are just in a band.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we don't do broadcasting,
it's a waste of fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't cultivate it with your corn
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by doing this, we have now basically
created a weed free zone right over the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when either this day,
about a week later, we'll come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going by elevator to see later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll do more of that sort of
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that we found out accidentally,
sort of accidentally, we found that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: laying corn at this stage actually
increases the yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see somebody do a study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have done two side by side,
two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was on purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second year, the first time,
we ran out of fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where we planted, it yielded 10 weeks
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no weed difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was in a field.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't go back because we didn't have
weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was going to drive 20 miles with a
10-week field for three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it made the corn better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all going to attribute to this
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's slowly going to say that
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we think that maybe there's something
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I want you to see, though,
is we do have shields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some farmers out there don't have shields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with no shields.
[SPEAKER_05]: The great thing about shields,
though, is we use less weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use about four gallons per acre when
we're doing tiny corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we get into the bigger corn,
maybe set a Passover or get bigger weeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: we might use six.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those shields keep the heat close to
the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you need it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't have to use much fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we have not planted soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little scared to.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't plant corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do plant sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works very well with sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you a little bit more about
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of you guys are familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll leave the time to see if you
already know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot on top of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have smaller cultivators that I
don't have to do, single-sweep,
[SPEAKER_05]: fire-resistant cultivators, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can never have cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bought a few cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can find them for a sheet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they work great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I first got organic,
before we were organic, that was
[SPEAKER_05]: conventional.
[SPEAKER_05]: No-till operation, that's sprayer,
120 of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the first people that,
when I got in Denver, they said,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need to have the same capacity of
cultivating that you have of spray now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a kind of lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: 110 foot room, 10 mile an hour of sprayer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we actually have enough
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not quite there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a cultivator of 400 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have big fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our fields are right around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 acres in one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been done by a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have lots of elevators.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have tiny weavers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like the tiny weed, basically for an
elevation of three days after planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have the light weedings there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the two different tiny weavers,
the regular standard ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see where they're just standard times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a rotary one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rotary one works great high-resiever
situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one's a basic, but they're far
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we ended up with the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of times, we go in with
situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does be blind situations, when there's
no corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do very little tiny weeding after the
drop stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have not had a, I haven't seen the
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in small range as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, so then we're going to talk
drills, planters, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, raw seeding, this is our raw
seeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we'll be on next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my employees, my father,
lost his own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't hold a lot because a lot of
money for that little spreader.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually the only reason the neighbors
are retiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we're making a lot of cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have this 30-foot drill.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do no till.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also has a big tank up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're planting small grains,
it's important to talk about tiny seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing high seeding rates,
you need to make sure you're not till
[SPEAKER_05]: about every pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in some situations, if you're
planting three loads of acre, which we do
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes in rye or lees, some of our lees
and stuff like that, we plant three loads
[SPEAKER_05]: of acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 180 pounds of acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with that drill, we get 4,000 pounds
of that drill.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only like 25 acres of planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're going to plant 400 or 500 acres
of something, that's a lot of votes even
[SPEAKER_05]: with that drill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this little smaller drill,
it's really a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a numbers guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an econ degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look at my numbers a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really matters because I love organic
farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't go back to being a conventional
farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe organic farming is by far
the most sustainable way to farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're not making a profit,
you're not going to be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bottom line.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: So planter-wise, we have two different
planters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the big planter is the cedar island.
[SPEAKER_05]: That has our, we'll talk about the dong,
rolled with pepper on the front.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we love that for soy beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use it a little bit in corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use it all in corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has all the precision planting stuff on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's left over from our years old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have all the big goodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: This other plan, I paid $3,500 for out of
Iowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an eight-row.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody modified it and pulled it up
because we had an arrow for the time that
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys need around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a 3.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the 90s, our farm was all strips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a six-row line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the neighbors saw we were crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, what a waste of time and
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the row, I had to turn right
around and go right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we were getting away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had, we were leaving a 20-foot grass
strip.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were using a 3.5 anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because head ends will get heat,
where we drive on the crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by doing that, our hills are not going
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hills are staying the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is our decay diets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have all our 9,000 repeatable.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our tractors have our decay diets.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're repeatable.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our head tractors share all of
these to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes, we control every other mass
so much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you have to make a trail of fire
like that, that's really hard to roll on
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground without expensive extra
steering and stuff like that that would be
[SPEAKER_05]: exact.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we need to be exact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not talking about being all
attention to the building, not exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's a video of rolling from the
tractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may, it should be close up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just see the rollers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier, there was a mention about going
to a roller that is smaller, that is
[SPEAKER_05]: narrower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it follows ground temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we went with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have big flat mills.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have, you know, a lot of times we
plant rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we happen to notice that,
usually we do a little bit of intelligent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's not smooth out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to get a good grain, we got to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be able to flex it if there's
enough steel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also like the way, with the amount of
the planter, it rolls it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to explain that scene in person,
but it pushes it down right ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you're not actually hair canning
into the furrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of pushes it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it works really smoothly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's continuous.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, yeah, they use, and they use high
ground pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a whole way around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of the same idea for high ground
pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can adjust it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you use for clothing?
[SPEAKER_05]: For clothing mills?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so we're actually just using the old
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went back to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have slight clothing mills that I've
used for no-till conventional for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We planted them in wall-covered box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but when we started rolling,
all of those, they got big ground fat back
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times it could get in to the
wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we found, fortunately good that way,
another trick we found buying soybeans
[SPEAKER_05]: into this is you need to plant deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do that even with our regular
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say an inch deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll plant in this situation,
I'll plant three inches deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The slot may, when you're walking top,
may not look closed, but you can't see the
[SPEAKER_05]: seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's closed down in the barn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's our beans just coming off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a perfect stand, but it'll be enough
that we'll get a good yield out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, there's some weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a perfect situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is specifically what we have now
moved to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the reason is when we no-till and
never rye, we have now went to raising
[SPEAKER_05]: food grade wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot have rye our wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is no way to follow no-till
beans and have rye in them and go in and
[SPEAKER_05]: plant food grade wheat and not have some
wheat volunteer wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to get away from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I may, I'm hoping that we can figure
out our crop rotation, maybe that we can
[SPEAKER_05]: bring it back, because it does work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other problem we have is we have
inconsistent soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can have bias soil types in the 20-acre
field, but not more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you over-wear, we'll have dials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we have issues with spots that
don't have any wider roles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what we've started doing is we
plant rye at the same time in the spring
[SPEAKER_05]: when we can plant soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: This gets us in, actually, among earth
plant our beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of waiting until the rye is in
the proper stage of growth, which is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like late May, now we are
planting usually in the last week,
[SPEAKER_05]: April, the first week of May.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will literally go in with our drill
and set up half that spacing, the big
[SPEAKER_05]: drill we saw, plant and plant two books of
rye, and we are in the same field planting
[SPEAKER_05]: with the beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is what the rye,
oh, I should have just been saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this picture, you'll see, you don't see
the rows over this side.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my trial, we were doing on 50-inch
rows, too, to see which we liked better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yield was no different, but 30-inch rows
gave us spot drumming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or trying to come back and grow kelby,
or other types of rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we plant, you can see here's the
beans just cracking through.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the rye outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other great thing about this is the
rye comes up a few days, importantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are reducing the amount of days that
we have open soil there to run off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We end up getting something to grow
quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a little bit later,
I'm not sure, probably a week or so later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beans are coming up now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have tiny-weeded these when they were
small, back before the other picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And amazingly, the rye still went through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the picture we saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is, at this point, I had one of
my landowners who never had an organic
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer on his farm before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the second year I had organic crops
on his farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told him I was planting beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: He calls me, and we went away for the
weekend or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get this very nasty phone call.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you know, his son,
he works for Bear and Santa.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are like, yeah, I can't do
anything to the rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like, what kind of mess you have
out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you plant soybeans and bottle
waters and that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, this is the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, no way.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I told him what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, oh, yeah, that'll be a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what it looked like a few
weeks later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now rye basically just kind of starts
to roll through this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will literally, by the time it
hardens, you won't be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just kind of disappear the whole
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then, oh, there's our wheat sample
picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not the same field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we do reduce the weeds after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some years, I'll use the weeds after and
hold on to acres all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some years, I might give the weeds after
and I'll accept the gains.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends on the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is that field, the first field
that had rye in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this field actually made over 70
different gains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the neighbor or the planter,
he actually was sitting in his truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he was impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now his son, who has a Tesla with the
camera, two of his beans are across the
[SPEAKER_05]: road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did weeds after the field call.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it did well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to show, though, is I talk
about economics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to show you this on corn,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is comparing, for all us
organic farmers here, we see lower prices.
[SPEAKER_05]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like to see low organic prices.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need to compare to what convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look, I guess it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yield-wise, we're very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our farm's yields have actually been up on
corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually very similar on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We no longer raise any conventional crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had to dig out figure budgets and
reviews out of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the high ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for instance, let's just look at our
costs here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organic, we have a organic crop,
which would be similar to those over here,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, just under $60 an acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you imagine those old times,
with the chemicals they're using,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're over $600.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their costs are higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the price of the bush is
higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we have the bonus of the oxygen
price, so the higher cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's cost is higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that figure that ran in, that figure's
on time, labor, and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to remember, things aren't bad
sometimes on prices.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So legumes, we're big into legumes before
corn, small grains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to grow as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peas, we are now using austere winter
peas, which I'll talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: about how to use those to plant them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the fall, there's no tillows in the
stubble, three and a half inches deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually after Thanksgiving, they may or
may not be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ideally, they don't come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they end up usually coming up the way
our winter peas sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we let them grow so about a
minute, a minute late May, and we plant
[SPEAKER_05]: them down in 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my preferred one is very little work,
or just a hayweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This just shows what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those worms, those are my little
wormworms.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's being in my nutrients
available, what we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see there's a pea plant,
but there's a little bit of rye out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the austere winter peas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That picture on the left, that would have
been taken, these are all whole year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this would have been taken in
December, whole year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't look like much.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're just plant for cover,
probably like a hundred and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ideally, I don't want them any taller
than what this left picture is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did get taller.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we let them grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was May 26th in the little picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: The left and the left picture,
the right picture was earlier in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're actually, they had gotten 60
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were running this whole disc over
them because we couldn't get them to plow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they were so stringy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 60 feet tall, and now they're
laying all over the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we ran this disc over them,
knocked them down, and followed them
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're provided to current age.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is that corn field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corn is planted on May 26th.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is this corn field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Later in summer, the corn field averaged
256 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's average.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on the edge of the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one thing we've been working on
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the average.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can talk about crazy numbers and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the average that matters because
that's what pays us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our average is not going as far as the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you'll see on my budgets, I use an RK
back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our costs are still, our costs are
$100.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're still very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were $8 a bushel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're still, we're still profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, like I said,
in my mind, if we can be profitable,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: These conventional ones, those guys,
you know, which used to be me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now they're with the popular banker
or something or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's going to be a fun discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're going to have a fun
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small grains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We said we raised some different wheat,
oats, cereal, rye, barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the top one is spring wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was sort of my first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the picture I said.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we raise, we do, we raise hardware
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we raise hardware wheat or farm ground
flour up here in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use spring wheat and wheat and
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at my chance meeting, and I tell
people, you know, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing, we come to these meetings and
some people like offerings.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was total chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purdue had their first ever organic wheat,
just like you guys have today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was speaking on hay production.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was speaking on grain production.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to know each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: We became friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we just kind of worked out
what we needed, another person to raise
[SPEAKER_05]: wheat out of the area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then we found that we had a little
different plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was nice to have that, that kind of
works together with the spreading of the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got a few years ago, I came up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy that, enjoy the friendships you
make in this and being able to call
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody in the questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a mentor when you're in a plant
and you're getting into a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you're long-term organic,
it's all about communication, talking,
[SPEAKER_05]: and finding out what works for one person,
what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we all have so much information.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the cool things about
organic over conventional.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was in conventional farming,
it's like, oh, they see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people sit and talk, you know,
one farm doesn't share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't work, we're all very open to it
and we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do raise oats.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a weird one and a half
started right when we started raising hay
[SPEAKER_05]: in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found an oat variety that would be
raised, basically 38 to 45 test weight
[SPEAKER_05]: oats in Ohio, which is not heard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically Canadian test weight oats in
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, our protein is 2.2%
higher than the Canadian.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before we were in, we were selling this
to a little female for their feed rations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now then we build a following amongst
all the ownership there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we deliver usually between 15 and
20,000 bushels, 225, 250 bushels at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't care it's organic,
but they love the service.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do all right on the price.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's usually been about 20 miles,
but I have sick of the driving,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works out good taking everything less
than one foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it never fails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, and I've had this with even some
English folks too, that they want you to
[SPEAKER_05]: shovel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I take the wagon, I put it in the
barn floor in the early one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not staying home alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing worse than shoveling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Into a greenery, that's six feet up in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So barley, somebody had, we were talking
earlier, a couple of us about,
[SPEAKER_05]: we raised quite a bit of barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've raised barley in our farm since the
1970s.
[SPEAKER_05]: My father was a hog operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We loved it and it's feed rations for
hogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could replace the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the cool things, we kept raising
barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our local water conservancy district
is called Muscana Watershed Conservancy
[SPEAKER_05]: District.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have taken their fees that
they charge land for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of going dredging out the water
and stuff, they're paying, they've been
[SPEAKER_05]: for almost one year, paying farmers to put
cover on something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had this program.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got into supplying the seed because we
can supply a seed cheaper than they can go
[SPEAKER_05]: get it from, say, Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we supply them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They supply even 5,000 to 6,000 acres a
year with three pines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we provide them with a barley oats mix
that they put on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be a rye mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I have heard of rye that's
mixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all these conventional farmers are
scared of rye in the last spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: When rye is this tall, it makes them get
nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they like barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barley works, but it's a great outlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we sell, we sell probably 70,000 oats
just for farming, just for the cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's worked well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also, we're gonna talk about
sunflowers since the second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost all of our sunflowers are double
crop behind barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard Peter ask about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've had really good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also raised some single problems,
but it seems like for us in Ohio,
[SPEAKER_05]: later we plan up to a point, we can plan
up to about the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_05]: Later we plan the better the yield and the
better the disease, disease versus
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance all year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't actually plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: They prefer dry weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunflowers thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had really dry weather this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the best sunflowers this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's some sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're rye.
[SPEAKER_05]: What Heather said earlier, it's a 30,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: We plant 25,000, but we don't want to
plant too little because you get these
[SPEAKER_05]: huge heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've not had a drying problem because
we take all our sunflowers off at 15%
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture and then air dry them a bit with
just air.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get them down to 10%.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is when they're big heads,
every time one does fall off a head,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a big mess because you lost a lot
more of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus they're a lot harder to harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a nice consistent head size.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I showed what our average yields in
Ohio have been around to 1,800,
[SPEAKER_05]: 2,000 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we actually have 2,400 pounds an
acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best yield we've had in
average.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also had a year I've averaged 1,300
pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet years are, as you said earlier,
wet is terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if it's wet in the first three
weeks when you plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the forecast is for wet weather,
if you're planting sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: please move back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd better all the weight will dry out
because you will end up having a re-plant
[SPEAKER_05]: or have a weed mess or you'll have disease
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Purdue Agribusiness, who some of you
know, they do contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of you may know my views on
Purdue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll leave those there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still do contract with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done, it's a great place for a
market or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that market and it's been good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wish their prices would go up
as any year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the hay sales, I'll just hit on this
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can speed through how long I'm going to
have, but we'll just hit on it quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our goal has always been to provide
consistent high quality care to hay
[SPEAKER_05]: locally and then deliver it to small
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than a lot of the hay used to come
in from out west in our area in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of customers don't want to have to
pay for an entire semester at one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will deliver a basic pass up
straight away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we double, everything's wrapped,
nothing dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said about quality, everything's
tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our best quality, we consistently can
raise 180, 200 RTA, one time between 60%
[SPEAKER_05]: protein and hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because not every customer wants that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every customer is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we raise everything from lower volume
when we first come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything's sold privately.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't do through options.
[SPEAKER_05]: I basically build a mailing list over the
past 20 some years of customers that have
[SPEAKER_05]: offered me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with over a thousand names on it,
I send that list out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty much how we sell over
hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they basically call us, while we've
been here today, I find it fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it is what allowed us to get
into organic, but it's also what pushed me
[SPEAKER_05]: to get into organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in 2000, I think 14 or 15,
a whole bunch of my conventional berries,
[SPEAKER_05]: small conventional berries, within about a
three week time span in November of that
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember I had all these phone calls,
canceling their hay orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to go organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were getting picked out of that
organic valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was involved, and the next
question, I was obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't worry about getting hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that kind of, I've been thinking
about switching to organic, and that gave
[SPEAKER_05]: me the push to keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we make hay, we talk about
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might have a video later.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three wrappers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two big square rails we're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a pick up crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually there's probably nine or 10 of us
at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best day we ever had was 1800 big
square rails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're out, and we were done in the
house by 10 o'clock that week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can pretty much bale 100 bales an
hour per baler.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's 200 bales an hour, and we can
pick up that many.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wrapping is maybe not quite that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's a fast process,
because I don't want those bales,
[SPEAKER_05]: once they're baled, to sit very long
before they get better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're getting, we're getting five bales
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We start making hay usually last week to
April.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of May is what we shoot for,
and then every full week, we get hay after
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all kind of a blur.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rain is done.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had up to seven cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made hay as early as the middle of
April, on a weird year, to get early.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also made hay as up to a day
after Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my contact info.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go past it here, just to show
you a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's my time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I want to talk about,
I said about the Organic Farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm the policy chair on the elected,
I'm elected to the Organic Farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are working on a, I along with Amy
Brook from the National Organic Standards
[SPEAKER_05]: Board, are working on some legislation,
which who knows what way things are going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be easy right now, but we've been
working on this for 18 months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to meet people,
we need your guys' support.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want, we're trying to get imported
organic grains to be tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we're importing organic grains,
fraudulent or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, a lot of times, aren't held to
the same standards that our domestic
[SPEAKER_05]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us domestic growers, we deliver
grain, might get tested for GMO,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, whatever, they can test.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of this stuff that's coming in from
other countries, they don't test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: At a local place, we were delivering
soybeans and testing our grain for GMO
[SPEAKER_05]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's trucks coming in from a barge,
I found out later in Argentina,
[SPEAKER_05]: they weren't testing, because they said
they always do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, if you feel led to do it,
I would appreciate it, and if you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: get in here, our booth, I have a booth out
there, and you can find it, but if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't, you've seen this with your phone,
and there's a quick little thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can sign on to sign your support.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, if you come to our booth,
they think things on food, and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to get, we need to show support to
specifically Amy Sager from Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_05]: who's going to be the one introducing
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to see support from organic
farmers, organic consumers, organic
[SPEAKER_05]: leaders, that support her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I would appreciate the support of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, with that, that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say one thing, because these
two, I've been to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_05]: conferences, and I helped Ohio State start
theirs three years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't realize how good you have
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a fantastic turnout for the first
conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and you guys have done a fantastic
job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this has been really good.
Scott,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How late are you planting your sunflowers,
and how late can you plant your
[SPEAKER_02]: sunflowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've heard that you can go pretty
late and still get decent meals,
[SPEAKER_02]: but.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we plant July 1st is our date,
and we go by about a month of the 10th of
[SPEAKER_05]: July, and with the later faults we've had,
we've not had any problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably need to go even bigger than
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try them this year after week
to see if I can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, as I was saying, in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you do plant the shorter seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to plant them, but if you
plant the long seeds, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions, Scott?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of being isolated,
and you don't want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it is, you're isolated, and yet you guys
have this great community, so it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a similar situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's not, you guys have a way
better group.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a great organic group.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably, it wasn't taped,
but it sure would be great to share it
[SPEAKER_05]: with some friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is taped.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is taped.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long seeds do you plant, and what is
your average prostate problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we plant, in our area, I'll answer the
long seed corner part in two words.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, normally in our area, most people
plant 110 days a form.
[SPEAKER_05]: We plant, the longest we plant is 104 out
of 105, and we go down 90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to take our corn off earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're no tilling, when we're
planting, we are no tilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will take our corn off at 20% pressure,
and dry it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to start early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our prostate is usually no tilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your biggest crop?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your biggest acreage?
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, an acre, and those are probably
my most, I would say our area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any issues with the C4 naked after
planting?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's why we plow, and so we try to
bury it enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we found is, if we run the Lincoln in
a high-speed disc, and we don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: bury it like 200 Z, we have to wait
usually two weeks, and what we've gotten
[SPEAKER_05]: off there is it has to be dry,
even if the soil is dry, we actually wait
[SPEAKER_05]: two weeks to plant and plant it,
and then we're ready, and then we get to
[SPEAKER_05]: plant again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's why we plow, and we try to bury
it like six inches deep, and then we come
[SPEAKER_05]: back the next day before it's dry out and
we plant again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we get it planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you plant, it's going to rise into,
what was it, your soybeans, so it won't
[SPEAKER_05]: ruin the lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your row spacing on the drill?
[SPEAKER_05]: The drill's seven ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two questions on your flame weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you flame all your corn acres?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we try to.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you only do the in-row flaming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you talked about the in-row
flaming, but then I saw a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-row flaming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we only flame over the row?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't flame in between the rows
because, I mean, it can be set up to what
[SPEAKER_05]: they call broadcast flame, and I know some
people that do that, and they say it works
[SPEAKER_05]: really good, but it's just, you use it at
least twice as much propane, and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: slower, so I'm like, this will just be
over the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can dry them on the floor for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were telling the story earlier about
how the soybeans and the cereal rye were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at the same time, and then at some
point the cereal rye was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the cereal rye, because it's a winter
crop, and it doesn't fertilize,
[SPEAKER_05]: it will get about, and it depends on how
much moisture you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's dry, it won't get as tall,
but it will only get about that tall,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it just kind of goes away,
and if it can't really fertilize,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not going to be able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, it's just kind of an eye face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only ever had it fail one time,
of course, this year, because it's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our farm, or our home place, we were dry,
and it's super dry, and we planted it
[SPEAKER_05]: early, but we planted it early,
like I said, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we came back, we had some later ones,
or two weeks later, our beans were there,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the beans came in the wrong
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University, on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
