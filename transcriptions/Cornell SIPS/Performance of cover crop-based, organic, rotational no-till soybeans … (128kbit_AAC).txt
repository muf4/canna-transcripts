[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, as Tony mentioned, we're going
to talk a little bit about my work on
[SPEAKER_00]: organic no-till soybean systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have enough time to share all
of the work that I've been involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last two years, but I wanted to
at least introduce you to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that I have been working on at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I've been involved in five
main projects that we can organize under
[SPEAKER_00]: three main topics or themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is winter cereal thermo
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with cereal rye,
barley, and triticale, 12 cultivars across
[SPEAKER_00]: those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work is in New York, as well as in
Maryland, where we're working with Stephen
[SPEAKER_00]: Mersky at the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really going to help us predict
phenology and cover crop biomass.
I'm sorry, but can you speak a little
louder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak a little louder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also working on the trade-offs,
looking at the trade-offs between forage
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and yield for winter cereals that
are grown as forage double crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: so double cropping systems that dairy
producers might be employing on their
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this work is with Corrine
Ketterings and a really big group of
[SPEAKER_00]: extension educators and farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of sites throughout New
York, as well as Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a lot of fun to work with
such a big team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, my last three projects
really fall under the umbrella of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop-based organic rotational
no-till soybean systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that uses a roller crimper,
which you can kind of see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This implement on the front of the tractor
here, it's used to terminate the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roll them down flat, and I'm going to
talk about this at length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these projects range from system
economics all the way to focus more on
[SPEAKER_00]: weed ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today, I'm going to talk about one
of these projects where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures of barley and cereal rye to
enhance weed suppression in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aren't just disparate projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this common thread here,
and that's that they all involve winter
[SPEAKER_00]: cereals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either as a cover crop for weed
suppression or as forage for dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other than a really long name,
what is cover crop-based organic
[SPEAKER_00]: rotational no-till soybean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might not be familiar with
this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photograph is from the Musgrave
Research Farm in Aurora, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've highlighted here,
this is how you would typically prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your primary tillage,
your secondary tillage, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and plant, for instance,
your soybean crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in contrast to that, with these cover
crop-based systems, you need to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: a cover crop in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking at here is cereal
rye and barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be implanted in mid-September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it reaches enthesis,
so mid to early June, so I should say
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-May to early June, they're ready to be
terminated with a roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it looks like after that
roller crimper has passed over those cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, forming a nice thick cover crop
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That provides your weed suppression and
then you can no-till plant through that
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop mulch for these no-till-based
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've established you have your
tillage-based management and then your
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop-based no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why would farmers be interested in
this different type of soybean production?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think back to 2013, we had a really
wet June and August in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at a photo from Aurora,
you can see a lot of surface erosion
[SPEAKER_00]: washing out of soybeans here in these
tillage-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a plot adjacent to it,
you can see that the soybeans are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up undisturbed through this thick cover
crop mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, surface sealing of those clay
soils, you see standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, this cover crop-based
system is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the main reasons
farmers are interested in this system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's from a soil health perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to reducing erosion,
a lot of research has looked at increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity, so both below ground and
above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously associated with reduced tillage
or disturbance in these rotational no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of system advantages,
it's really for conventional and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a conventional grower that might be
struggling with herbicide-resistant weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can think of this as an integrated weed
management approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a really simplified way,
you can think of these cover crops as
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing your synthetic herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for organic growers, that would be
replacing your cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, these cover crops provide
many other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention here, when you're
comparing it to tillage-based organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production, we see about a 30% reduction
in diesel, fuel, and labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting, when you talk to
farmers at grower meetings, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn to this from a soil health
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about energy savings,
but it's really about reducing tillage in
[SPEAKER_00]: their crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's really driving them
towards adopting this type of management
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is this the new perspective for
farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me sitting on a tractor, you've got the
roller crimper out front, looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: field, a winter cereal is ready,
roll that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working right now on a farmer manual
to help address some of these issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are coming up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So issues related to weed suppression in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most common questions that
we get at grower meetings is, how does
[SPEAKER_00]: this fit into my rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are typically planting,
if you think of a corn field, a
[SPEAKER_00]: corn-soybean-wheat rotation, soybean would
be following corn grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this system to work,
they would be establishing a winter
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal, like cereal rye, after they've
harvested corn grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be really late in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not going to provide enough biomass
or a uniform stand for weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right off the bat, that's going to be a
real problem for farmers if they're stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: in this corn-soybean-wheat rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my perspective, I'm interested in
kind of a food grain-based system that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have more small grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like wheat would be a really
good crop to precede this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wheat's going to be harvested in
August, and it gives you lots of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish something like cereal rye in
early September.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working on a feed grain-based
system, a short-season corn silage would
[SPEAKER_00]: work, and that's going to push you maybe
into mid-September for establishing that
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to draw your attention to,
if you look at these later planting dates,
[SPEAKER_00]: so these are six different cereal rye
seeding dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photographs were taken on April 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice at these later planting
dates along the bottom, you see a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: soil between those rows of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you see exposed soil,
that's where weed seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real problem because in this
system, it's those early emerging weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that really dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got wild buckweed, common
ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to emerge before you
actually roll that cover crop in late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, they've come up in
that stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's cereal rye in the
background here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at some of these data from
Pennsylvania, you can see common ragweed
[SPEAKER_00]: here in these violin plots emerge a lot
earlier than other common summer annual
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bulge in this plot here indicates
that the majority of that species is
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging, in this case, in early April.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, we would expect this to be a
few weeks later, but that's still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the majority of them emerging before we
roll down these cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a real problem because
common ragweed emerges early, and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: can survive rolling and crimping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has really informed a lot of our
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just a phenomenon on the
Musgrave Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is throughout the Northeast,
this common ragweed just dominates in
[SPEAKER_00]: these cover crop-based no-till soybean
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of previous research,
the focus has really been on maximizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal rye biomass, so manipulating
seeding date and seeding rate and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of other factors like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerging from that has been this threshold
of 8,000 kilograms per hectare,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been suggested that if you can
achieve that, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent or adequate weed suppression
throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some problems with that with
this successive cover crop production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's lodging, which you see here,
in really fertile soils, and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult to get good seed-to-soil
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get good soybean seed
placement through a thick mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this photo here, you can see that
they've added sandbags on top of these
[SPEAKER_00]: planter units to try to get more down
pressure so that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate that thick cover crop mulch and
get good seed-to-soil contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly challenging if
it's dry in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on, obviously, if you don't get
that good soybean seed placement,
[SPEAKER_00]: germination is going to be poor,
and some of these soybeans that do emerge,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see, are pretty chlorotic,
and you're going to see a yield loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our research, and the way it
differs from all this previous research,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we're moving away from a focus on
this maximum biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, we're focusing on optimizing
early season shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: For better weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do that, we're looking at
mixtures of barley and cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cereal rye is tall and slender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley is going to be shorter,
wider leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not suggesting that this is really
a true niche differentiation, as you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect with a legume and a cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these slight differences in phenology,
stature, and leaf architecture might be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to give us that edge to provide
better early season shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a couple objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in the impact of these
cover crop mixtures on weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as ultimately on soybean yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking at two main
management treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high residue cultivation, and then just
standard no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're looking at those effects
on weed suppression and soybean yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of experiment design,
we used a split-block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So replicated four times over two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2012 to 2014 at the Musgrave
Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seeded our cover crops in a replacement
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a barley monoculture,
a 50-50 mixture, and then a cereal rye
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were seeded, as I mentioned,
mid-September at 19 centimeter row
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will note that I have some photographs
in here from 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the data I'm going to share is
just from 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just have time to share a subset
of all the different treatments that were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to simplify this in
the interest of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, you've got your two
management treatments, standard no-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to involve rolling,
crimping that cover crop when they're at
[SPEAKER_00]: anthesis, and then no-till planting
soybean on that same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do anything else until
you come in and harvest that soybean in
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: With high residue cultivation,
about two to four weeks after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: planted that soybean, you're going to have
a single pass with a high residue
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator to control some inter-row weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the reasons why we use
these wider soybean spacing, so 76
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter rows, so it facilitates the
operation of this high residue cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did include, adjacent to those
plots, an inter-row cultivated treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this allows us to compare these
cover crop-based management practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be kind of your traditional
tillage-based soybean management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at this roller crimper a little
more closely, it basically involves a
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinder with these blunt metal blades
welded in a chevron pattern, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bend or crimp these plants at
their base, as opposed to shearing or
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting them off as a mower would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important distinction,
because we want that cover crop mulch to
[SPEAKER_00]: persist throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you mow these cover crops down,
which has been looked at in other
[SPEAKER_00]: research, it's of course going to increase
the surface area, which is going to speed
[SPEAKER_00]: up decomposition, which is going to result
in poor weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the high residue cultivator,
after those cover crops have been rolled,
[SPEAKER_00]: this implement has really wide sweeps on
it that are intended to slice through the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil just below the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sever weed shoots from weed
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has really thin shanks,
with the intention of limiting the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of residue that's dragged all over the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this photo kind of shows that we had
some trouble actually calibrating this
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get enough cover crop biomass,
and you can see some soil that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: turned up between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you wouldn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd barely notice that this piece of
equipment has been run through the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of seeding rates, we based our
replacement series on a rustic rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we adjusted for differences in
size and mass for the barley seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why we refer to this as
density-based seedings, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume-based seedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this low density is equivalent to about
one bushel per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this high density is two bushels
per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the soybean, this is a
really high seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 300,000 seeds per acre,
which is a double conventional soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soybean seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about herbicide-based
conventional soybean production,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are essentially weed-free systems,
with the exception of issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide-tolerant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have really high
germination rates for the soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good seedling survival,
obviously very little to no weed
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can use those lower soybean
seeding rates and still get maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, this is really part of our
cultural weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use these high rates to achieve
canopy closure earlier in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to provide greater shading,
which is going to reduce the fecundity of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these later emerging summer
annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, less seed production
from some of those later species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, in concert with that rolled
mulch, really forms the basis of our weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this photo is a little bit dark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're seeing is a shot from
underneath that soybean canopy here that's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see a little bit of sunlight
filtering through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see that nice rolled cover
crop mulch there along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of sampling, before those cover
crops were rolled, we measured cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass and population, photosynthetically
active radiation, or light transmittance
[SPEAKER_00]: through that cover crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after they were rolled,
weed identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at weed biomass and then also
soybean density and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly measured a lot of other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is just a subset of this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the interspecific cover
crop competition, we've got cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are placement series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's seeding ratio along the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got your low density and high
density seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll notice here in the low
density is that, oh, I should first
[SPEAKER_00]: mention, these dashed lines are your
barley monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dotted lines are your cereal rye
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the solid lines here are your
50-50 mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing here is what we
term over-yielding at that low density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, this is a higher
absolute yield in that 50-50 mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: barley and cereal rye compared to a cereal
rye monoculture or the barley monoculture
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these studies, typically that's
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it's a legume and it's a cereal,
you want over-yielding, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: these are being grown for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for our purposes, we're really more
interested in shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this higher biomass here actually
translate into enhanced shading and thus
[SPEAKER_00]: better weed control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also just note, we actually
didn't see that in the high density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of different reasons
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the cereal rye has greater
competitive ability, especially in what
[SPEAKER_00]: would be considered more resource-limited
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at par transmittance,
so that light that actually is making it
[SPEAKER_00]: through that canopy, we have the same
seeding ratios along the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually don't see enhanced shading in
that 50-50 mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, you see that par transmittance
increases as the proportion of cereal rye
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, at that cereal rye
monoculture, that's where you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: least amount of light reaching the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that barley monoculture,
that's where the greatest amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually making it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at weed biomass across
those seeding ratios, you see a really
[SPEAKER_00]: similar trend, as you might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if there's more light coming
through the canopy, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: greater weed germination, higher weed
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, less weed biomass when
there's less light making it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this really clearly in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your barley monoculture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a lot of common ragweed that's
emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really did not have nearly enough
biomass production there, or of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: shading to suppress those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the cereal rye monoculture,
we had actually pretty good, pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate weed suppression throughout most
of our treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at total weed biomass,
you can see that common ragweed comprised
[SPEAKER_00]: over 80% of that biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really dominant in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had foxtail species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellow and giant foxtail made up about
8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a variety of other weeds made up
the remaining 10% for this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to then focus on common
ragweed, let's look at those management
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got common ragweed biomass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, let's look at the difference
of high residue cultivation and standard
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was about a 20% to 30%
reduction when you integrate that high
[SPEAKER_00]: residue cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can see by the arrow
bars, this wasn't a significant reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think of this from a farmer's
perspective or a more applied perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing common ragweed biomass by a few
hundred kilograms is going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for long-term weed seed bank
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a lot lower
contribution of weed seed seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a problem later on in their
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this photo is from 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to use this to
illustrate how effective that high residue
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these lighter rows here are soybeans
that are ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll notice in the standard
no-till, all these dark patches here,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that is common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at the high residue
cultivation, you can see no common ragweed
[SPEAKER_00]: at all in between those rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under certain conditions, this can be
really, really effective at taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: that inter-row common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, what we're really interested in
is shading a really good predictor of
[SPEAKER_00]: common ragweed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got common ragweed biomass on
the y-axis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cover crop biomass, so combined
both barley and cereal rye biomass here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then par transmittance on this right
side chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, you can think of this as a
lot of the previous research is focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relationship, just maximizing cover
crop biomass, whereas we've shifted the
[SPEAKER_00]: focus over here to par transmittance or
shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found, both in the low and
high density treatments, as well as all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other treatments I couldn't discuss,
was that, in fact, shading was a much
[SPEAKER_00]: better predictor of common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, we definitely had
higher R-squared values when we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting to note is,
as we saw with the low density and that
[SPEAKER_00]: over-yielding in that lower density
treatment, high biomass production doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily result in greater shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely suggests to us that we
really need to focus in on shading to
[SPEAKER_00]: really tackle this issue of early emerging
weeds like common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of soybean yield, we actually saw
no differences between seeding ratio or
[SPEAKER_00]: management treatments, which was
surprising, given the differences in cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop biomass, as well as weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, we got about 40 bushels
per acre, which is actually the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: yield we had across all of our different
treatments and our on-farm sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically get 45 to 50 bushels,
which is really competitive with other
[SPEAKER_00]: organically produced soybeans,
so tillage-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we compare this to the intro
cultivation, we see about 80% of that
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's definitely a substantial
yield loss there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a little bit related to
these were not very productive treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you need to factor in the
fact that there's going to be a 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in diesel fuel and labor with
this type of management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, we found that early-season
shading definitely was an important
[SPEAKER_00]: predictor or common driver of common
ragweed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these mixtures of barley and cereal
rye might not be the best way to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve that enhanced shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely encouraged to continue
pursuing this because preempting that
[SPEAKER_00]: common ragweed biomass is just so critical
for addressing these issues for farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that high-residue
cultivation was really useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling that inter-row common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think of it as a rescue
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for long-term weed seed bank
management, this might be a really useful
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is actually different than
what we'd expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybean yield was not higher when you
integrated that high-residue cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in some ways, this might be
a desirable result for us because what it
[SPEAKER_00]: suggests is if we focus on cover crop
management and so we can really suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: those weeds with just standard no-till,
you're not going to see a yield loss if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't integrate high-residue
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, for farmers, they're not that
interested, when we've gone to Grower
[SPEAKER_00]: Meads and talked about this, in using a
high-residue cultivator because the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose or their whole interest in this is
a reduced tillage system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of high-residue cultivation
is not very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely see a high potential
profitability for this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you get these competitive
yields in combination with this reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in energy use, this is going to translate
into higher profits for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd just like to thank,
in particular, Chris Pelzer, Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: Caldwell, and the rest of our lab,
and all the folks at the Musgrave Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly couldn't have done this
research without everyone's assistance and
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's time, I'd love to take some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
