[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a pleasure to be out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Steve said, my background is in
geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to be interested in something
like this that you see in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an invasion of Sahara mustard in
the Mojave Desert out in the Western US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I rarely get the chance to actually
see any of these things in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: because for the most part, what I do is
use data that other people have collected
[SPEAKER_00]: from the field to try to understand stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the spatial distributions of either
distributions or abundance of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what biogeography is, and that was kind
of an introduction to it, but biogeography
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically trying to use the
distributions of species to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something more about the biology of those
species, about the ecology, how those
[SPEAKER_00]: species interact with native communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about an invasive species
like oriental bittersweet, the evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of those species, how those species have
interacted over larger time or adaptations
[SPEAKER_00]: to global change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really saying, all right,
people have gone out and collected all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these locations where we know this species
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can that information tell us
about, in this case, invasion risk of a
[SPEAKER_00]: species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an assumption in
biogeography, and particularly when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about regional scales,
but this affects landscape scale models as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that basically the distribution of
this species, whatever this species is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeing over here, is a
reasonable approximation of where that
[SPEAKER_00]: species could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, where the suitable climate
is for that species is described pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well by where that species is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that assumption that the distribution
of a species is a good approximation of
[SPEAKER_00]: where that species could be of suitable
climate for that species has been used for
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of different papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are now probably classic papers
when you're talking about global change
[SPEAKER_00]: and species movement and species
distributions to predict things like what
[SPEAKER_00]: species are likely to go extinct
associated with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're here now, but under warming
temperatures and altered precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the richness or diversity of species at
any one of these red spots could decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know what their ranges are now
and we know or we're predicting what their
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges might be in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been done in Europe and Mexico
globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This assumption that distributions of
species are a good approximation for
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable climate has also been done for
activities like predicting or assigning
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are the species now and what does
that tell us about where they could be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where lots of them are likely to overlap
in these kind of red and yellow areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been done, so this is an
example, that I've done on modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for invasion with climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you've got Kudzu,
which is really badass down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: southeast US.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the end of that car.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a house under here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a place that you want to live
if you've got Kudzu in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example showing
expansion of Kudzu up into the northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: into New York and Massachusetts where I'm
from by the end of this century with
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, all of these are based on this
assumption that distribution is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: approximation of suitable climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to do, and I'm going to
get a little wonky here, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the biogeography side of things,
but holding to that application of really
[SPEAKER_00]: what all of this is trying to get at is
how much are we going to trust and in what
[SPEAKER_00]: cases should we be trusting spatial models
to really inform what we're doing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, our monitoring, our management,
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to look at two different
questions today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a question of comparative
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much are those species
distributions approximating climate for
[SPEAKER_00]: native versus non-native plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to explore the native
plants a little bit further in the second
[SPEAKER_00]: half and ask whether native plant ranges
are really describing their climatic
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to start on that first one,
the equilibrium assumption, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really fundamental to a lot of
biogeography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equilibrium assumption says, going back to
Hutchinson's paper of 1957, species is at
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium with its environment when it's
present basically everywhere that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be, all of the suitable areas,
but not present or absent in all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that are unsuitable for that
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're doing any kind of model
based on whether it's climatic suitability
[SPEAKER_00]: or the suitability of soils or other
features of a landscape for a species,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're assuming that this is true for that
species, that it is present where it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be present and absent where it cannot be
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with any kind of
distribution model is that we could always
[SPEAKER_00]: be missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our model is based on all of these
gray points in here and we're missing
[SPEAKER_00]: these green points out over here,
then the model that we're going to create
[SPEAKER_00]: is not going to be an accurate
representation of the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation conditions that this species
could exist in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why might we be missing the species out
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be because we just didn't
survey that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're missing a couple of points that the
species actually exists in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that it's some sort of an
invasive species that started out over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and just hasn't expanded to those
areas yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that these temperature and
precipitation conditions don't currently
[SPEAKER_00]: exist on our landscape, but they might
under future climate conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we deal with those kind of
challenges in the modeling framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for invasive species in particular,
this assumption of equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the assumption that a species is
describing its full niche, its full area
[SPEAKER_00]: that it could particularly persist in,
is fundamentally flawed for an invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that invasive species are
spreading across landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spreading across regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of the kudzu beetle,
this guy over here, which does in fact eat
[SPEAKER_00]: kudzu, I'm told, but it also eats
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the drawback of why we're
concerned about this particular pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the spread between 2009
and 2012, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really broad scale spread of that
particular pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only considered the distribution of
where it was in that early stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation, then you'd probably be
missing a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, even up to 2012 is probably
missing to a large degree where that
[SPEAKER_00]: species could specifically exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do is try to tackle
this question for invasive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking, how bad is this
equilibrium assumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far off are we in general when we're
talking about invasive plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium with the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a paper published almost
two years ago in Global Ecology and
[SPEAKER_00]: Biogeography, if you're interested in the
more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way we wanted to go about this is
we know that there's never any species
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be in perfect equilibrium,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be someplace that
species either wasn't able to get to or
[SPEAKER_00]: that space climatically doesn't exist yet
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way that we can define this
perfect equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do is we can compare
native and invasive species and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to each other, how far off are
invasive species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much should we be worried about
missing something in terms of our modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: of invasive plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hypothesis is that for a native plant,
they have had lots and lots of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just going back to the last
glacial maximum, we say 20,000 plus years
[SPEAKER_00]: for these species to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other places that were less affected by
glaciation, you've got way more time for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a given number of occurrences,
we would expect that those species,
[SPEAKER_00]: native species, would be more widely
distributed and that they would also have
[SPEAKER_00]: a larger modeled potential range based on
that broad distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, we might hypothesize that
non-native plants, including invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, would have a much smaller
distribution relative with the same number
[SPEAKER_00]: of occurrences and a smaller modeled
potential range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those two things, we could sort
of say, all right, that also affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: longitudinal and latitudinal extent of
those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That your native species, you would expect
to be more widespread than your non-native
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a way of presenting that
previous graph in terms of some line
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as you increase the number
of occurrences, you would expect both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things to go up in terms of your
overall potential range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would expect that the native
species would be higher overall than the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did we test this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We went about testing this using all of
the plants that we could find within the
[SPEAKER_00]: continental US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we downloaded the whole list of plants
from the USDA plants database.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually closer to about 20,000
species that you find within the
[SPEAKER_00]: continental US.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA breaks those into native species,
endemic species, alien.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are non-native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the alien ones, we also
separated out the invasive species based
[SPEAKER_00]: on ones that are either noxious weeds or
identified as invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that on the invasive plant atlas
of the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And endemic, USDA doesn't actually break
that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endemics we got from another database
and separated those out as well in case
[SPEAKER_00]: something interesting was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at, so we
cross-referenced that database against all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the herbarium records that are
available in this global biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: information facility repository for global
herbarium records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of states, regions are putting
their data into that repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are where the plants have actually
been found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone has a geographical latitude,
longitude record of where those species
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up with our 13 585 total
species that actually had enough records
[SPEAKER_00]: in the global biodiversity information
facility database that we could create a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable model based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the analysis of this was that we
took a particular species, so all these
[SPEAKER_00]: dot circles are the location of that
particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a pretty simple PCA based model to
look at potential range of those species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is showing up in here in this kind
of light yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said potential range is just a
count of all of these pixels, these yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of where that species could
potentially be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at one other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at range infilling, which is
basically the ratio of where all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: species are present to all of these areas
where it could be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we thought, well, if we're
thinking about invasive species in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, can we say something about
more invasion likely on the horizon
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with where it is relative to
where it could be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to go back to that hypothesis
again, so look first at latitudinal and
[SPEAKER_00]: longitudinal ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our prediction, again, is that our
native species both native and endemic
[SPEAKER_00]: species together should be more
widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had way more time to spread across
landscapes and regions in which they could
[SPEAKER_00]: have climatic suitability than our
relatively recently introduced invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: and alien species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's our prediction and here's our
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly the opposite of what we predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas we thought our natives and
endemics were, I guess I should say that
[SPEAKER_00]: any species that we're looking at,
any time you read biogeography literature
[SPEAKER_00]: related to invasive species, you always
have this kind of clause at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, oh, we know that invasive
species are not at equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably an under prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're seeing is actually the exact
opposite, that it's our natives and
[SPEAKER_00]: endemic species that are much more
narrowly distributed, both longitudinally
[SPEAKER_00]: and latitudinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a significant difference between our
invasives and our aliens or between our
[SPEAKER_00]: natives and endemics, but between the two
groups, a very strong and significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second hypothesis, you guys can
probably figure out where we're going on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one, that the potential range then of
native species would be greater on average
[SPEAKER_00]: than non-native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, we find exactly the opposite,
that as you have increasing occurrences of
[SPEAKER_00]: either non-native or native species,
you're seeing this increase in potential
[SPEAKER_00]: range that you might expect, but
consistently it's the non-native species
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-natives and the invasives that are
higher up in terms of the modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: potential range than our native plants
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're fundamentally rejecting this
hypothesis or this framing that non-native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are really not at equilibrium with
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what we're seeing is compared to
native plants, arguably it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-native plants that are closer to
climatic equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-native plants that are probably
creating better models of distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of rain shifts associated with
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so probably the reason is because we
are really good at introducing invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of, we know that most of the
population of invasive plants in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 60%, probably more than that,
are introduced as ornamental plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly a much higher proportion of that
for our non-native, non-invasive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are introduced as ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's an example of, this is a
Centoria species, so bachelor's button.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is declared as an noxious weed in the
southeast part of the U.S., I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee, but is obviously really
widespread, introduced and planted in our
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens across the U.S., and its potential
range, as you can see from that look,
[SPEAKER_00]: light yellow, really, really broad because
it's inhabiting all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: climate conditions across the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can compare that, so here's your
bachelor button, with 458 occurrences,
[SPEAKER_00]: this species is getting pretty much the
entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes almost double that number of
occurrences for the average native species
[SPEAKER_00]: to get even close to that, and it's not
even fully getting there in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: full range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even our most common native species are
still showing much more of this clumping,
[SPEAKER_00]: bunching than our kind of average
non-native or invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So range filling was that other question,
okay, and you guys can probably guess
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the way these graphs look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Range infilling is that question of how
much more space is there to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more can the species extend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our native species, you can see
that there is still a fair bit of this
[SPEAKER_00]: light yellow, yellow space within its
potential range, but for the invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species, there's tons of that light yellow
potential range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at range infilling,
we're seeing that the native species are
[SPEAKER_00]: much more kind of clumped together and
have infilled within their ranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the invasive species, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the average invasive plant,
the average invasive plant is filling in
[SPEAKER_00]: only half as much of its potential range
relative to the average native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think that your average invasive
plant is gonna behave like your average
[SPEAKER_00]: native plant, then that means that we are
currently only about halfway there in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the amount of spread within
landscapes or within those regions that
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants could potentially do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example, this is a bamboo
species where, here are all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: locations where this bamboo has been
introduced, and we know, and in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is up into New Jersey as well,
and there are a bunch of pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: people already getting angry at their
neighbors for planting bamboo that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into their yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that these species are likely
to, this guy up here in New Jersey was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty angry about his neighbor's bamboo
coming into his yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've got some of natural spaces
and open spaces that are already being
[SPEAKER_00]: taken over by that species, which is an
ornamental plant that's widely planted
[SPEAKER_00]: across the southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us, which is really,
from a biogeography perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really interesting, because it
tells us kind of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it tells us that actually a lot of
our risk assessments for invasive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to climate and relative to
climate change are probably pretty good,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least pretty good relative to
natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also tells us that the natives,
our projections relative to climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a little bit sketchy,
right, because the natives are not
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently distributed and facilitated by
us in terms of being introduced in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for invasive plants, unlike what we had
expected, the invasive plants are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: very widespread, could be considered much
closer to this climatic equilibrium than
[SPEAKER_00]: the native plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see that there's really low
range filling associated with invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and so there's probably a lot more
of these landscape scale invasions that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should expect on the horizon, as if we
don't have enough to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, so that was the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of alluded to the second
question when I said that the equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that we did left this kind of
question about what's going on with native
[SPEAKER_00]: species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start out with this framing that
says invasive species are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not at equilibrium, and now we're
saying, well, actually, it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: native species that are less like
equilibrium, that raises the question of,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how well are native species doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well are plants ranges within their
native ranges describing, so sort of going
[SPEAKER_00]: after that same question, but their
climatic tolerance or their equilibrium in
[SPEAKER_00]: that case with climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is ongoing kind of large scale
discussion of this question, both within,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, particularly within the invasive
plant literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a paper from, I think,
2011, where what they were looking at was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, you have a bunch of species
that come from Europe, and they're moving
[SPEAKER_00]: to North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: North America to Europe is in this one,
and Europe to North America is in this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the blue on here are areas
where that species is inhabiting the same
[SPEAKER_00]: climate space, both in Europe and in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are mostly blue,
mostly blue on both of these, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of area where the species is
expanding its climatic niche, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it moves from one continent to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their underlying statement here was
that it's pretty rare for a species to
[SPEAKER_00]: change its climate space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you've got a species in
Europe, and it's within this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and precipitation regime,
you move it to North America, for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, it's going to be within the same
climate space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be within the same
temperature and precipitation regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would suggest, if that's the case
for invasive species, that suggests that
[SPEAKER_00]: for most species, if you've got a given
temperature and climatic regime,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's probably what that species can
persist under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is arguing for equilibrium or
close to equilibrium for these range
[SPEAKER_00]: shifting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another study that was published
only a couple years after that that came
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically the exact opposite
conclusion, that also looked for species
[SPEAKER_00]: that were native to Europe and shifting
into North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, in this case, all of the
orange areas are ones where there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic niche expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's most of North America had this
niche expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two papers are basically arguing
the exact opposite conclusions with
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly similar sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is sort of fundamental to this
question as well of, well, how much are
[SPEAKER_00]: native species generally in equilibrium
with climate conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a paper that was published
about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want more of the details,
actually, our first author on this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: UMass undergraduate student who compiled
all of the data for this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hypothesis is we're just going to look
at species that are native to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this species, for example,
of Texas sedge, we're going to assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a particular climatic tolerance
associated that can be described based on
[SPEAKER_00]: its native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if that species of Texas sedge
were moved over to Nevada or California,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would be within the same climatic
conditions as are found in its native
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are looking specifically at
species that are native to the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: so described by this biota of North
America program, but also have adventive
[SPEAKER_00]: range, so basically a non-native range
within the US as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are almost all exclusively species
that are within the ornamental plant
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are cultivated species that have
been taken from parts of the US and
[SPEAKER_00]: planted elsewhere in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was we looked for all
of the occurrence data that we could find
[SPEAKER_00]: within both that global biodiversity
information facility is one source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, because not all herbaria are up
to date in terms of reporting there,
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at a whole bunch of different
regional herbaria for any occurrence data
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both the native range as well as this
adventive introduced range, and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: the adventive range because the biota of
North America program tells us where its
[SPEAKER_00]: native range is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compare the climate conditions
between those two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the areas where it's been
introduced outside of its native range
[SPEAKER_00]: under similar climate conditions to the
ones where it's native?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Chionanthus virginicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white fringe tree or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see on this map are the light
blue areas or all of the counties that
[SPEAKER_00]: this tree is native to all across the
southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have all of the occurrence
locations that we have in the dark blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dots as well as the red dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark blue dots are the ones where the
occurrence of that species is within its
[SPEAKER_00]: native range, and the red dots are the
ones where the occurrence is outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: its native range, including up in New York
and Massachusetts and Connecticut and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, and also including up
here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that species has been introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's what we find with that
particular species, which probably doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise you too much looking at this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the conditions in New York
and Connecticut and Massachusetts are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty different from the climate
conditions down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That generally what we see for this
particular species is that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: persisting in these areas where it's been
introduced in areas that are cooler than
[SPEAKER_00]: its native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also slightly drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of points in areas that are
slightly drier than its native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reds on here are all of those
advent of the introduced points,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the blue on here are all of the native
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's also plenty
of overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of climate conditions in
the advent of range that are well
[SPEAKER_00]: represented within the native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely a little bit cooler,
a little bit drier on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that compare to the overall
number of species?
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, we had 144 species that we
were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 of those showed lower precipitation in
the areas where they were introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to their native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the median decrease, I don't know what
the right word is, the median amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation lower than its native range
was 23 centimeters, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: substantive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of work in the Western US,
and there are a lot of places that barely
[SPEAKER_00]: get 23 centimeters of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty substantive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 90 out of the 144 species are showing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expansion of route tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing 56 of the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: 56 of our 144 showed an expansion of heat
tolerance, with the median amount being
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.2 degrees C warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason for there aren't super
number of species that are going in this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction may just be the geography of the
US, that there's a lot more space as you
[SPEAKER_00]: go further north than going south.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at cold tolerance,
so we had 80 out of 144 species showed an
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion of cold tolerance and a median
of 2.9 degrees C different in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: that climatic range that could be
described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that last piece was that we also
modeled the potential range of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is for that one particular
species, so Chionanthus virginicus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue is its potential range based on
just its native range, and the red is its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential range based on the native plus
the adventive range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see in that case, we're getting
quite a bit up into New England and
[SPEAKER_00]: further north from that native southeast
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, 128 of our 144 species showed
an expansion of their potential range when
[SPEAKER_00]: you considered both the native and the
adventive points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The median amount of expansion was 35% or
700,000 square kilometers, which I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: last night is about five times the size of
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty big area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about, OK, we want to
understand how species are likely to move
[SPEAKER_00]: with climate change and what their current
range is, and we're missing five New York
[SPEAKER_00]: states, then that's a pretty big area that
we're underestimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hypothesis that we started out
with, that adventive locations of that
[SPEAKER_00]: species are going to be really similar to
the climate space where they started out,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we're seeing the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to dig a little bit into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what sort of species are actually
expanding the most in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: climate space?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, well, maybe if they have an
expansion, they'll have more points in the
[SPEAKER_00]: adventive range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the species if they've got wider
introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll have this larger range size
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just kind of a big clump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter how many times you've
been introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does seem to matter is the size
of your native range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for species that had relatively small
areas to begin with, as you start
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing points outside of there,
we very rapidly get a big shift in climate
[SPEAKER_00]: space and a much larger predicted range
size as you start adding more adventive
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these species with small native ranges
appear to be less limited by climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a really nice model of climate
describing their range, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually climate that's limiting the
ranges of those narrow range species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to go back to this comparison
early on, that initial framing,
[SPEAKER_00]: where early insects say huge amount of
niche expansion when you move from North
[SPEAKER_00]: America to the US, and Petit Pierre say no
niche expansion when you move from Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you actually plot those species
together relative to what their native
[SPEAKER_00]: range size is, you see a very similar
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, like the Petit Pierre study,
had a really large, like you were really
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread meaty species all across Europe
to begin with, you get introduced to North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not expanding much because you're
all over the place to begin with in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the early insects paper,
they were looking at a lot of species that
[SPEAKER_00]: had much narrower ranges in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had a lot more space to expand
and climate space that they were expanding
[SPEAKER_00]: into when they got to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that tells us, basically,
is when we go back to these fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns, and certainly this is a
fundamental concern when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about climate change, of what's going to
happen to rare species, what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: to these really narrow range species,
this analysis and my current thinking on
[SPEAKER_00]: this is that, well, we've done a lot of
climate modeling and constructed all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things for these really small range
species, but it may actually be that
[SPEAKER_00]: climate is not what's important for the
ranges of those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't mean that they're not
still threatened by climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're narrow range to begin with,
you've got a lot of other problems going
[SPEAKER_00]: on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate change may very well
affect those species in place to a large
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it doesn't necessarily mean,
and what these guys had said previously,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't necessarily mean that those
species cannot move into a new climate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions or expand into other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our conclusions from this are that the
native ranges, basically, especially small
[SPEAKER_00]: range native species, are not doing a good
job of describing climate tolerance for
[SPEAKER_00]: the native plant pool, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be a little bit of a silver
lining in terms of projections of risk for
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change that many of these small
range species, if we were to start
[SPEAKER_00]: considering tools like assisted migration
or moving some of these species in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: of climate change, that those may well be
effective mechanisms currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if a distribution model or the
geography of its current location would
[SPEAKER_00]: not suggest that it can establish and
persist beyond where it currently does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just to go back to the
conclusions of these two studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That spatial modeling, any time you guys
look at a biogeographic model,
[SPEAKER_00]: any time you look at a landscape ecology
model that's based on the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: species, those are assuming that the
distribution of that species is reflecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the habitat of that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope that I haven't convinced you
that distribution modeling is crap,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are definitely some good
examples to use it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to convince you of today
is just that there's more nuance to
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding when we should really
believe the models and when we should
[SPEAKER_00]: raise an eyebrow and say, well,
are you sure that that model is
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the species that I only
know in 10 or 20 or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: location?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks so much for listening to me,
and I'm happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was glad with this last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was looking at the earlier models
that you were showing, what struck me was
[SPEAKER_05]: they were all habitat, and really no
discussion of like bird of war or any
[SPEAKER_05]: other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with the simple expansion system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is a real challenge in terms of
just the data that exists out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time that you're dealing with a
spatial model, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: the underlying data are just points in
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those points could be occurrences,
they could be absences, they could have
[SPEAKER_00]: some abundance information in them,
but that's fairly rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of folks who are really
trying to get after building more spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic models, understanding
interactions between predator prey or
[SPEAKER_00]: insect plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenge of that is just like,
how do you get both spatial and
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic data of multiple species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we need to really focus our
data compilation and collection in the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction that you would like to support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I mean, the other challenge is
that you end up doing it for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the great things about just
spatial modeling generally is that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do it for lots of different species and
try to see if consistent trends emerge
[SPEAKER_00]: such that you can say something now,
something relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question about your native versus
adventive distinction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So climate's changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you look at all of the adventive data
are newer than the modified climate
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to the native data, which may
tend to be any decades older?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question with that paper also is
we don't necessarily know that those
[SPEAKER_00]: species are established.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that they are because they're in
herbarium records and herbarium records
[SPEAKER_00]: generally go for areas that are relatively
natural and not like in the watered fields
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we look specifically for
dates on a lot of those records.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the herbarium records that we
have are relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are definitely some that go back
to the 60s, 70s or earlier, but the big
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk when you actually look at them are
like from the 90s and later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think relative to current climate
change, that's probably a time period when
[SPEAKER_00]: we can say it's been relatively similar
for the last 20 or 30 years when most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those points are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in comparing the native species with
introduced, it occurred to me that the
introduced species tend to be introduced
because they are, particularly the
[SPEAKER_05]: ornamentals, are introduced because they
have a wide climatic tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can only live in Florida,
there's much less incentive to introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: them if they can be sold all over the
United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other is related is that the
introduced species tend to be
[SPEAKER_05]: disturbance-oriented.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to start to have that on the
fields on the right side and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the native species are largely,
things that existed in undisturbed
[SPEAKER_05]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we go around disturbing
habitats, then you get these things
[SPEAKER_05]: existing in a lot of different places,
whereas the natives are kind of stuck in
[SPEAKER_05]: these pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's a really good
hypothesis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, but it's one that hasn't
necessarily been tested for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: native species just because we haven't
widely introduced tons of these native
[SPEAKER_00]: species all across different parts of the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's widely going to be true
that your invasives and your weaner
[SPEAKER_00]: species are disturbance specialists and
that your native species generally are
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that we've actually done
a full-scale test to really nail down how
[SPEAKER_00]: different they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, your first part, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The characteristics that we love for
ornamental plants, that they're wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic tolerance and they grow fast and
produce lots of seeds and showy things and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that are exactly the kind of
things that we worry about in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is definitely a lot of overlap
between that selection pressure coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and what ends up within the invasive plant
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like your question of
whether, how different they are from the
[SPEAKER_00]: native populations in terms of that,
yeah, in terms of the range and filling
[SPEAKER_00]: and the widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about the spatial scale
of the underlying processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we think about temperature and
precipitation, when we think about RH,
[SPEAKER_05]: what occurs is kind of distribution of the
biomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But both temp and precip, they're kind of
operating at a co-spatial scale,
[SPEAKER_05]: as is biome scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we think about across the
landscape, we don't see a ton of variation
[SPEAKER_05]: in precip and temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's driving the variation at that
spatial scale?
[SPEAKER_05]: Species distribution of biomes,
what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's driving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a fantastic spatial
question that we all need to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the slats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the null hypothesis is that
it's all profitable pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we could go after that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disturbance certainly affects them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microhabitats like soil qualities and
abiotic local things, water availability
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect and slope and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That presumably biotic resistance has
something to do with not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of species, but certainly the
local abundance of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diversity or traits of your native
community might affect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things that I think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, and actually Steve and I
were talking about this this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: of whether there are data sets out there
and trying to go after data sets that
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually try to answer those
questions spatially.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I think of just pops into mind
is the face experiments, where you see
[SPEAKER_05]: poison ivy, for instance, outside of the
ring is like no poison ivy, inside is
[SPEAKER_05]: poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So clearly the availability of CO2 is
limiting growth of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily non-invasive,
but surely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so CO2 certainly for invasive
plants, there's consistent trends of CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitating invasives more so than it
does native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that, I think, is just that going
back to the definition of weediness,
[SPEAKER_00]: of fast-growing species like more
resources, and so absolutely CO2 is a
[SPEAKER_00]: tricky one spatially, though, because it's
for the most part it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you just speak a little bit louder?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a really fascinating
question, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never done any work on native range
as well as non-native range of invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but there are a lot of people who
are trying to look at those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is most
fascinating about that is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the evolutionary history
of those species within their native
[SPEAKER_00]: range, and are there places on earth,
just biogeographically, that breed
[SPEAKER_00]: invasives just because they're more
competition, longer evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary history, more enemies that
you could potentially be released from,
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of studies of that for
East Asian species being introduced to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast is one example, and African
grasses that are fire-prone being
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to a variety of continents and
perpetuating fire cycles there is another
[SPEAKER_00]: example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really neat question,
but I don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one last question for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you comment on, you know,
you're talking about these models of
[SPEAKER_05]: expansion, but those models are based on
other models, like compression models,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're talking about PCA, which are based
on observational data and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were commenting sort of on the
organisms that have a smaller range,
[SPEAKER_05]: but doesn't this apply to everything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the smaller range... So the
assumption of equilibrium is one we have
[SPEAKER_05]: to make, you know, in regression,
believe that equilibrium will help in this
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the plants are not in equilibrium to
begin with, that would do the regression.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having a false assumption in terms
of what the factors are that are
[SPEAKER_05]: contributing to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this representation... Well,
but then I think that what these studies
[SPEAKER_00]: have shown to me is that if you're a
widespread plant, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the widespread plants, actually,
it is probably a pretty good assumption to
[SPEAKER_00]: say like that it's close to equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, for me, it's like this
narrow range versus wide range kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I would be most...
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be more skeptical of narrow range
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the intriguing part for me
just biogeographically is to try to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out like more things like that,
you know, like are there particular cases
[SPEAKER_00]: when we should trust the models more or
trust the models less because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly lead us to better monitoring and
better management later on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean people who do spatial models on
bears use very different methods than
[SPEAKER_00]: people who do spatial models on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of that is also because you also
have absence data and you can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can observe things,
you know, multiple times through if you
[SPEAKER_00]: get colors on bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a big problem in terms of
trying to understand stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's why we've been trying to
go after abundance information more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more because at least it doesn't
necessarily give us absence data,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least it gives us more insight into
like here it's actually invasive versus
[SPEAKER_00]: there it's just like there's a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just one fun question.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the ideas seem to be about the,
or the questions were about data
[SPEAKER_04]: collection, whether the data was available
or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were a data czar, what are some key
strategies you would implement to help
[SPEAKER_04]: better answer these questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's great that you're asking
that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have been trying to put
together some like recommendations for the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of invasive plant abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's fantastic work going on through
like IMAP invasives in the state of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York through a lot of the different state
level organizations, but those tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: just occurrences and so we don't have
absences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any sense of how bad the
infestation is or the aerial extent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two main things that I would love
to have for plants are an estimate of
[SPEAKER_00]: percent cover and an estimate of the area
of infestation and those could be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely like just you know,
I don't know 20% cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fair bit of it here kind of
thing and about the size of this room that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be totally fine for a lot of the
modeling stuff that we're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have also been looking through
there is a citizen science and management
[SPEAKER_00]: database called EdMaps and we've been
looking through that larger database to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to see what people are doing when
they're reporting abundance and those tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be kind of ranges for percent cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like less than 1%, 1 to 5, 5 to
something 10, 20, 25, pick your number
[SPEAKER_00]: there or greater than that and those also
work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we can't because we can't ask,
you know, most managers to go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: start running like fixed transects you
know across the landscape at you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand points but they're going to be at
a thousand points they could probably say
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's about 5% cover or something
in these areas and that information gives
[SPEAKER_00]: us a lot of power too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
