[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Lauren and I have a couple of
questions, and we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: frame it in two parts.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first part is going to be where are
opportunities for young scientists who
[SPEAKER_08]: want to commercialize great ideas,
and then Lauren's going to cover more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you have an idea, how do you actually
do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we each have a couple of questions
that we'll use to try and get the
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion going.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take audience questions as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not planning on doing much talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to hear from them, not us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we will get started.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, kind of the first idea that I wanted
to explore is that plant breeding is
[SPEAKER_08]: unique because there are fairly diverse
employment opportunities for students
[SPEAKER_08]: coming out of a PhD program.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can work in private industry,
you can work in academia, you can work for
[SPEAKER_08]: CJIR centers or other international
breeding institutes, or in the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States, there's also USDA government work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, those are kind of the four pillars of
employment for plant breeders,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the hiring environment has been a
little difficult, I know, for some
[SPEAKER_08]: students lately, and it's a volatile
market with the way agriculture works.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, right now, and in the next two or
three years, what do you see as the
[SPEAKER_08]: climate for small breeding and
biotechnology startups?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Alan has the microphone, and we'll
start with him, and then whoever wants to
[SPEAKER_08]: chime in on this will kind of go from
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I'm seeing right now,
it's kind of the opposite of the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of Midwestern breeders are actually
coming to California to vegetable seed
[SPEAKER_09]: companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: The vegetable market has gone up about 5%
per year in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're seeing a lot of breeders moving
from the Midwest, maybe traditionally corn
[SPEAKER_09]: breeders or something like that,
coming to vegetable seed companies,
[SPEAKER_09]: which are very, very different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, and I think as a student,
you need to think about that just because
[SPEAKER_09]: you have a project working on,
oh, it doesn't mean you can't breed
[SPEAKER_09]: pineapples or trees or walnuts next year,
and you need to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The concepts are the same, the generations
are longer for some of these crops,
[SPEAKER_09]: but the opportunities are there in
different markets, and you have to sell
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself in the sense that it's
quantitative genetics, it's statistics,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's selection theory, and that's the
basis of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're going to see a lot of
startups come out with these mergers that
[SPEAKER_09]: are going to happen, you know,
three big mergers, you know, five
[SPEAKER_09]: companies are going down to, or six
companies are going down to three.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a lot of spin outs
from this, from breeders that are just
[SPEAKER_09]: deciding, you know what, I'm going to just
do this on my own.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there's going to be opportunities to
become, you know, maybe partner with these
[SPEAKER_09]: people or make these, take these
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's, I could say from our eyes,
at least in the vegetable world and the
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit world, it's actually promising
because people care more about food right
[SPEAKER_09]: now than they ever have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd just like to point out there are
phenomenal opportunities in the sector
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've started, and the nice thing is
there are federal programs that are not
[SPEAKER_04]: being slashed, and these are SBIR
programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these SBIR programs are just great,
phase one, phase two, from USDA,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as NOAA, and that's a great
opportunity for students who feel that,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, you know, I'm in transition,
I've got some good ideas, I like to embark
[SPEAKER_04]: on some ideas, form a partnership with the
university because in SBIR phase one
[SPEAKER_04]: programs, you get six months to play
around on the government nickel.
[SPEAKER_04]: One third goes back to a university
partner, two thirds stays with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go for a phase two, then your numbers
go up much higher on availability of
[SPEAKER_04]: money, capital, and that's two years
usually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you want to, you go for the
million dollar ticket through phase three,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so these are opportunities for
entrepreneurship, and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody can't work at a university,
everybody can't work at a company,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you have some entrepreneurial
skills, use them and go out on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a seed company and distribution
perspective, what we're seeing is there's
[SPEAKER_01]: also an explosion of small and mid-sized
seed companies in the specialty market,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the vegetable market, and none of them
have breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all distribution programs,
or you know, businesses, so they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: source their seed from somewhere,
and they're, you know, becoming more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more niche and specialty, whether it's a
culinary side of it, or regional
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptation, or climate needs, or within
the organic, spectrum of the changing
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's whether you, there may be new
opportunities with small seed companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are just starting up and need
somebody to actually build a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program, or if you are starting a very
focused small breeding company,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are new players that are gonna be
looking for unique material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm not a plant scientist,
so I tend to focus on the science of
[SPEAKER_03]: business, and what I've learned just in
the last few minutes is we have a business
[SPEAKER_03]: ecology in plant breeding in which major
players are consolidating and becoming
[SPEAKER_03]: even larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having done this sort of work in other
industries, there are some axioms that go
[SPEAKER_03]: along with this type of movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larger the company gets, the dumber it
gets, and the less likely it is to do its
[SPEAKER_03]: own research in-house, and the more likely
it becomes to do its more innovative
[SPEAKER_03]: research on an outsourced basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that means for entrepreneurs is
opportunity, and if this is indeed the
[SPEAKER_03]: case in plant science, the path forward
would be to identify some technology that
[SPEAKER_03]: you think serves a need.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the gentleman next to me said,
there are SBIR opportunities available to
[SPEAKER_03]: a good grantsman or grantswoman in order
to get some seed money to literally seed
[SPEAKER_03]: money to start for 150K in six months,
and that should allow you to get to a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially relevant proof of principle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little bit different than the
proof of principles for which you're being
[SPEAKER_03]: trained to publish.
[SPEAKER_03]: A publication will get you notice
academically.
[SPEAKER_03]: A commercially relevant proof of principle
will demonstrate to a potential investor
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's money to be made by pursuing
your investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that investment, that may come from a
company, one of the big six, soon to
[SPEAKER_03]: become the big three.
[SPEAKER_03]: That investment may come from venture
capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's an opportunity for
plant scientists because increasingly
[SPEAKER_03]: venture capital is focusing on food
security and plant science as an area of
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity and as an area for investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had one of Cornell's successful
start-up companies to date, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: originated by Harold Van Ness in soil
science, agronomic technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The money, the venture capital money for
that, the leader of their round came from
[SPEAKER_03]: a specialty agricultural venture capital
company in Fargo, North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And previously, I'd say in the last 10
years, there's been an increasing trend
[SPEAKER_03]: towards this type of specialty money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's opportunity there for young
scientists with an interesting idea that
[SPEAKER_03]: may have good commercial application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just speak as a representative of a
dumb and probably becoming dumber company.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, one of the interesting parts of what
you brought up is that it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not so much the dumb part,
but the fact that not even around size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially as we're moving more
towards maybe analytics-based breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than just field evaluation based
breeding, that we realize that the
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies and knowledge and innovations
that are necessary in this space are
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely multidisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not something that any seed
company can manage on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have a field robotics
group and a machine learning group and a
[SPEAKER_00]: aerial imaging group, a satellite data
provider group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different pieces that come
together to do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days that really we can't,
no one company can do it itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, but Matt, your discussion
and your talk was really interesting to me
[SPEAKER_00]: in as much as you pretty much have a
distributed breeding model where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually outsourcing the breeding in some
ways in a way that's, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a small company already moving towards,
I think, involving your growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this opens up
opportunities for, if you're involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the technological areas that modern
breeding is based on, you can start small
[SPEAKER_00]: companies from a sensor standpoint,
from an analytics standpoint, even from a
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm standpoint, that I think can
provide great value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I come from USDA Agricultural Research
Service.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm located in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the sort of implicit question
for me since I work on plant genetics in
[SPEAKER_05]: Iowa would be, well, which do you work on,
corn or soybeans?
[SPEAKER_05]: Soybeans, but actually a lot of other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are easily more than two dozen
legume crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of those are represented in the
USDA germplasm repository spread
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, a large portion of the crop
diversity globally is managed within that
[SPEAKER_05]: system in USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So historically, USDA has had an interest
in maintaining and working with that
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, right now, there's a search
in USDA headquarters for a specialty crops
[SPEAKER_05]: research program manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are openings here and there
through the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are opportunities to work on neat
unusual stuff within ARS.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there market areas that are being over
served or underserved by breeding?
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is an imbalance, how do you
regain that balance?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what niches in breeding needs to be
filled now?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do you think will be the big
niches to fill in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so I'll just make this observation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I work on legume and pulse crops,
I've been really impressed by the
[SPEAKER_05]: entrepreneurship that Canada has shown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to refer to a whole country,
but there's been a collaboration over the
[SPEAKER_05]: last about 15 years between marketers,
international shipping companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: the Canadian government research arm,
universities, and growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have built markets and seed
sources for chickpea, lentil, fava bean
[SPEAKER_05]: that didn't exist 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: That if you go to the store and buy any of
those or field pea, you buy those crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably either come from Washington
in the US or from Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what happened there is they
identified a global market need and then
[SPEAKER_05]: filled that niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just provide one thought in as much
as there's a lot of hype, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work in kind of big data analytics for
providing growers services through
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like our arm in Circa or Climate
Core or a lot of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: One area that I think they're missing
across the board is looking at using big
[SPEAKER_00]: data, not even big data, but even small
data for smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of the data analytics are
based off of logging machine data off of
[SPEAKER_00]: huge John Deere tractors as they go
through the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or very expensive field-based sensors or
using and leveraging soil databases that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've developed here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to pretty much any other
geography, a lot of that's missing or not
[SPEAKER_00]: really available or not practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the question is how do you
improve the life of a smallholder farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: or the agronomic practices from them using
simple sensors, simple approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: even manually collecting collected data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an area that probably could
see a lot of growth in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to agree with what Neil
said.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the projects I've been involved
with, and I'll talk a bit more this
[SPEAKER_09]: afternoon, is we think about climate data,
we think about crop data, but we forget
[SPEAKER_09]: about the soil data because it's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I measure 30 elements, it's costing me 50
bucks for one sample and I've got to get a
[SPEAKER_09]: core of soil to get it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Agroforestry Center in Nairobi
over the last now 15 years has changed
[SPEAKER_09]: that with light technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can measure 80 elements in a 96-well
plate in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can now do everything we measure in
soil and now really measure soil per plot
[SPEAKER_09]: or per small farm with a handheld thing
and they have an iPhone app even.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can measure NPK on an iPhone app.
[SPEAKER_09]: USDA just took this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another opportunity to really
bring soil into the picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you use it is exactly how you're using
everything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just blops.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just bring it in.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm seeing in the trend is what I
said in my last comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are really caring about their food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nutrition and flavor are a big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: The challenge with quality for breeders
and for seed companies is to get people to
[SPEAKER_09]: pay for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: People won't necessarily pay for quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't pay more for quality,
but they'll come back for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a direct payment and say,
my tomato tastes a little better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pay 50 cents more for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably won't pay 50 cents more for
it, but you'll come back and buy it the
[SPEAKER_09]: second time.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it doesn't taste good, you're not
going to come back and buy it for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're seeing more and more of that and
going into that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, people are much more attached
to their food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thinking about when they buy something,
is it going to taste good?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is still a business model.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are not paying for quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: They say they want to, but when you look
at the market analysis, they're not paying
[SPEAKER_09]: more for it necessarily.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a challenge, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say a few words.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the field that I've introduced you
in is really now at that alpha level,
[SPEAKER_04]: just starting, there's great opportunities
in all different areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quantitative genetics is, I think,
a high priority, at least from my
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective, but a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are bilingual in one of the Asian
languages, there's a lot of literature
[SPEAKER_04]: there that is not in the English language.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you can read that language,
Chinese or Korean or Japanese,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really well worth the opportunity to
study and then translating that into the
[SPEAKER_04]: English language for yourselves or for
your company or university that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: working for.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of opportunities to go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned about that light technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Access to water samples as well,
does it extend to?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got to find out more about that
because that would save a lot of money
[SPEAKER_04]: from the samples that I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to my translators, there are
certain limits with Google Translator.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problems arise in the scientific
literature, so you have to be real
[SPEAKER_04]: careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a question about how plan reading
is a bit different than other initiatives
[SPEAKER_06]: in the sense that to get a product that
doesn't take a year or two, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: for, say, perennial crops like trees,
apple trees, it takes a really long time
[SPEAKER_06]: to get a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: That investor would see their return,
their investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with annual crops, it takes maybe
3,000 to 5, 4 years to get a new product.
[SPEAKER_06]: One approach would be something like math,
where you have a really small,
[SPEAKER_06]: where it's really local and convince
people to try out something that hasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: been tested really thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just that general problem, how do you
overcome that?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you convince the investors to take
that long time?
[SPEAKER_03]: My own personal experience lies primarily
in the drug industry and in medical
[SPEAKER_03]: devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: They share the same type of long-term
developmental cycle that you've described.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, within the venture capital
industry, there's a lot of wringing of
[SPEAKER_03]: hands as to how all the money has been
chasing after app makers, but the fact of
[SPEAKER_03]: the matter is that billions continues to
go into these long-term implantable
[SPEAKER_03]: medical device ideas and these long-term
development paths for drugs and also
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term development paths for better
crops with a marketable advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key is the marketable advantage and
demonstration of that in a sufficiently
[SPEAKER_03]: large and robust sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means you've got to figure out a way
to get the field trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's doable in part with grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's doable in part with friends,
family, fools and angel investment money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doable in part with early-stage
venture capital that tends to focus on
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural specialties.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are companies that have been already
identified and oddly enough, there are a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of Cornelians engaged in agricultural
venture capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working that network helps immeasurably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would put it back in your lap.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got and where does it stand?
[SPEAKER_03]: With a clear picture of what you have and
its potential advantage, we can then scope
[SPEAKER_03]: out what's necessary in order to bring it
to an investable proposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: That in fact is what the center does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work primarily with technology teams
who are trying to develop technology-based
[SPEAKER_03]: products and our output essentially is an
investable proposition so it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else's problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to talk more about how we do
it and what we do offline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to bring up a recent
experience I had which was we had a group
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and talk about what we're calling
the Open Innovation Program where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly looking at kind of like the SpaceX
grants or different challenges where
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than funding and research
internally, we put out a challenge in an
[SPEAKER_00]: open way often through one of these
companies that manage these grants or
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges and pretty much anyone can read
the challenge once they kind of check off
[SPEAKER_00]: the box, they can read more and ultimately
it's open to anyone to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was going through this
workshop, I in the end kind of realized my
[SPEAKER_00]: job was at peril because ultimately it's
open source R&D where I don't need to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: the solver doesn't need to be employed by
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money comes from the company as does
the challenge and then the solver kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up, raises their own hand and solves
the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways the response to your
question is I think that may become more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for example in the wine grape
industry, a lot of the research is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: funded in that way, often to grants,
to public institutions, to do research for
[SPEAKER_00]: private companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may become more of the Norman
breeding and if that's the case,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it may be more I have this specific
pre-breeding problem, can you solve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be actually a one or two year
project that I just need this tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: line, fix its photo period problem and
then give it back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a two year problem,
a small company or even an individual can
[SPEAKER_00]: grab it, fix that for someone and send it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be that rather than having huge
monolithic research programs within the
[SPEAKER_00]: big three, it may become more of a
distributed model and kind of break the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding problem up into chunks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The main thing I think in breeding is to
know your stakeholders and work with your
[SPEAKER_09]: stakeholders and help them understand your
timeline.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if people don't understand the
timeline, the product, the goals and
[SPEAKER_09]: milestones along the way, somebody is
going to be unhappy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It will probably be you because somebody
is going to bail out early.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of venture capitalists, I think like
Lou said, want that five year turnaround
[SPEAKER_09]: which is hard to do in a full plant
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other hand, there are
stakeholders that are out there that are
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing the long term.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_09]: Silicon Valley is really exciting for us
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you heard about Climate Core,
that's a spin out of Google that decided
[SPEAKER_09]: that they actually want to do something
instead of just another app with their
[SPEAKER_09]: technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark Zuckerberg out of Facebook just put
out a huge foundation that is managed by
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Somerville out of Berkeley and he's
focusing on food.
[SPEAKER_09]: His wife is focusing on medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically these Silicon Valley is
deciding to put their, they've made all
[SPEAKER_09]: this money and they're putting it in food,
in eggs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's some opportunities and as long
as they're managing that advantage by
[SPEAKER_09]: people that understand what it takes to
improve safe food, in this case through
[SPEAKER_09]: plant breeding, I think there's
opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just affirm that it is kind of
what we've been hearing from other people
[SPEAKER_01]: on the panel that nutrition, flavor,
regional cuisine are more and more a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the conversation and so finding niches
within that, there's plenty of opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to explore and every market grower who's a
produce grower that we talk to whether we
[SPEAKER_01]: work with them or not, they're continually
looking for what's new, what's next,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving feedback to what their customers
are asking for and that regional focus is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely offering new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to follow up on the investor
piece as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a couple opportunities early on to
work with a few different investors and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really excited about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end it didn't work out and we were
really excited in hindsight that it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pressures we put on ourselves to
produce and hit targets and run a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were really grateful that we were
able to build really slowly without
[SPEAKER_01]: investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a kind of newer round of
conversations with investors on some other
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces that we're exploring and what we're
finding as a very small company again is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're just as interested in the
people behind the company as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea and some of the feedback we've been
getting is that it's rarely that first
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that's gonna materialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always the next thing so they're
investing in you as much as your big idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was sharing the story of Google,
obviously a huge company, but when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were making their original pitch it was to
digitally catalog the Library of Congress
[SPEAKER_01]: and the investors saw the people as well
as some of the technology behind what they
[SPEAKER_01]: were proposing to do and saw the
opportunity into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you explore your business
proposition or your idea and you work with
[SPEAKER_01]: folks at Cornell or other parts of your
network, always have in the back of your
[SPEAKER_01]: mind what are other applications to that
technology, to that skill set,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the team you're putting together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it may evolve into because your
investors are gonna be looking at that as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to pile on to that point with
regard to the primacy of the management
[SPEAKER_03]: team.
[SPEAKER_03]: The axiom amongst investors and a lot of
others is that a good management team can
[SPEAKER_03]: take a silk purse or make a silk purse out
of a sow's ear and a bad management team
[SPEAKER_03]: will make a sow's ear out of a silk purse
and I personally have gone through two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three of those scenarios and I can certify
that that is indeed true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Investors will tend to think of a
discussion with investors or for that
[SPEAKER_03]: matter a discussion with an in-kind
investor like a university from whom you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to license technology and that
discussion will go kind of like the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time you wanted to take the family car out
on a Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dad will say or your mom will say
well who's gonna be in the car with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know where you're going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have enough money to get there or
call in case you run into problems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Investors in university licensing
departments will ask the same questions
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's in the bus with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have enough resources to operate?
[SPEAKER_03]: And those tend to be the three things that
we focus on in prepping a company for
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion with investors whether they're
venture capital or angel investors or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: The expectations are always gonna be the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: As technologists you have an intimate
knowledge of your technology and how it
[SPEAKER_03]: works and how it can be made to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very very important that you
understand what you don't know about the
[SPEAKER_03]: potential markets for your technology and
bring in people who have experience
[SPEAKER_03]: preferably who've worked in that
marketplace and who can guide you to steer
[SPEAKER_03]: the technology forward in an appropriate
way to meet market expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That meeting market expectations is a key
aspect where many many many many young
[SPEAKER_03]: companies will stumble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make an observation about
a different sort of regional opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife and I manage a neighborhood garden
and seven different groups growing things
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always a lot of unusual stuff and
we try a lot of unusual things.
[SPEAKER_05]: When visitors from other countries come by
and they see foods that they recognize
[SPEAKER_05]: from home they fall all over themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really miss these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a potential passionate market for
weird stuff to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitter melon or snake gourds or cowpea
leaves or bombara groundnut or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That they are just homesick for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may be a matter of just being
sensitive to some of those expatriate
[SPEAKER_05]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add one comment on an
article I was reading yesterday about the
[SPEAKER_00]: rise of wheat in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of starting to supplant rice in
some areas as kind of a specialty food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rise of rice eating in Africa as a
specialty food as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course in North America the
rise of lots of African or poor grains in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of quinoa or millet or amaranth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So global food trends and changes are also
I think a really interesting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're speaking more towards the immigrant
communities wanting to recognize their
[SPEAKER_00]: food but then there's the same in the
novelty of in some ways bringing orphan
[SPEAKER_00]: crops as opportunities for new food
trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just make one comment about some of
the experiences I've had working with
[SPEAKER_00]: small companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often I think one of the stumbling
blocks that we have is the company
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding well enough the economic
environment they're entering or kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what a grower is really looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the problems really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they focus a lot on the
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this really cool sensor algorithm
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you really ask who's going to buy
this and why would they buy it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: solution is it aimed to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often you kind of come up with either kind
of some questions or a lack of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: around that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it comes back to some of the
previous comments around working with
[SPEAKER_00]: alums or other entrepreneurial residents
or in the incubator's framework to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: build that knowledge about really what is
your invention going to do and why would
[SPEAKER_00]: someone pay money for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make a comment to add what
Neil was saying is you have to know your
[SPEAKER_09]: competition and sometimes your competition
is not what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked for a small company a while back
and we were considering putting BT in
[SPEAKER_09]: canola.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well the competition was a very,
very cheap seed treatment which there was
[SPEAKER_09]: no way we could put a research effort and
compete with that really cheap seed
[SPEAKER_09]: treatment that controlled the bugs just
fine and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes your competition is not your
direct competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if somebody comes up where there's a
big technology change that makes you
[SPEAKER_09]: obsolete.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have to be aware of those
markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually get questions all the time about
every Google alert that comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelp is the new kale is one that I see so
often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you get the seaweed that tastes like
bacon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get this there and basically what I tell
prospective farmers do a market analysis
[SPEAKER_04]: of where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn those skills first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell students if you want to go into an
area that is wide open this is the time to
[SPEAKER_04]: do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have that in terrestrial
agriculture but you do have that now in
[SPEAKER_04]: aquatic plant aquaculture using some of
the very technologies that you use in a
[SPEAKER_04]: terrestrial sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know getting that knowledge is
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're strictly in a science based
curriculum in graduate school take at
[SPEAKER_04]: least one business course business
planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would have said that 20 years ago or
30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I see the environment that we're
in and having that entrepreneur skill set
[SPEAKER_04]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah with respect to to the last point
there are lots of resources here at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell in order to pursue that and learn
about entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd encourage everybody who has an
interest to sign up on the entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_03]: yet see entrepreneurship at Cornell topic
email list.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pretty much every day on campus
and various locations on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are seminars dealing with various
subjects of entrepreneurship and ample
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities to learn about that in the
Johnson Business School.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wesley sign S.I.N.E.
[SPEAKER_03]: does a course in commercialization of
university technologies and that you you
[SPEAKER_03]: start with teams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything in business school is team
oriented so get used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you start with teams you're assigned
to technology you work through an analysis
[SPEAKER_03]: of that technology and eventually work
your way through to a business plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: This type of prep work is really really
very helpful at the center.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically we deal our stock and trade our
entrepreneurs who've been through these
[SPEAKER_03]: programs or want to be entrepreneurs
who've been through these programs and
[SPEAKER_03]: want to start building and implementing
their own plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we tend to focus at the center in a
process and that process really starts
[SPEAKER_03]: with an assessment of how realistic your
assessment is of life as an entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's damn hard frankly and not
everybody's going to make it and most new
[SPEAKER_03]: ventures tend to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in life sciences particularly where you
have a very high infrastructure load
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on whose literature you choose
to read it may be up to 95 percent of new
[SPEAKER_03]: ventures are gone by year five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look for in my early interaction with
wannabes a clear eyed assessment of what's
[SPEAKER_03]: involved and what they're in for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the few who survive that cut
frankly then we start working on building
[SPEAKER_03]: their business plan building their
management team around them and around
[SPEAKER_03]: their technology and spending as much time
as possible either through structured or
[SPEAKER_03]: unstructured program engaged in what one
of the other panelists talked about the
[SPEAKER_03]: customer discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes in a scientific context and
academic context success is measured by a
[SPEAKER_03]: publication in PNAS or a publication in
Nature and one or two adjulatory emails
[SPEAKER_03]: that you get from that and that means I'm
going to be rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the simple fact of the matter is
that's light years away from actual
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial success and translation from a
couple of adjulatory emails to an actual
[SPEAKER_03]: up and running company with people on an R
&D program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our approach is to sort of stair step
step at a time from ground zero up to a
[SPEAKER_03]: point where we get initial seed investment
where we can then command angel investment
[SPEAKER_03]: and then ultimately venture investment and
then move the company out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: incubator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a process and it's not a
straightforward process at time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It often involves pivoting your
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you may start out with oftentimes is
not what you finish with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the journey that's the key thing
and it's the process that you pursue
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's essentially knocking down a
number of points at which you can fail and
[SPEAKER_03]: making certain that you've covered those
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna make a really quick
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with DuPont for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with a lot of startups and
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hate to be an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to fail 95% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be safe and have a pension.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, the classes that you just
described would be perfect in an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: setting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as well as the experience of starting a
company and failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that it's not all or
nothing and there's a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: learning that's very appropriate to a
business setting, industry setting that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get through an initial startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're straight out of grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks great on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably better than a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Failing early and often is a benefit in
entrepreneurship because each time you
[SPEAKER_03]: fail you learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so oftentimes there's a great deal of
buzz around Silicon Valley and
[SPEAKER_03]: entrepreneurship in the valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact of the matter is most of
these have tried and failed two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: times before they get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally have a long history of
failure going back to my engineering
[SPEAKER_03]: grades at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took literally four tries at it
before I had a modest success.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there should be no fear in failure
because if you approach it from the
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective that each time you do this
you're going to learn more and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get better at acquiring a new
skill, then you're not likely to commit
[SPEAKER_03]: suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had heard some about what value in your
product are you creating and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening on the competitive landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, an ongoing difficult question,
and it's an important question whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a startup or not or big or small,
is who really is our number one customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between who we
wanted to serve and who we thought our
[SPEAKER_01]: customer was going to be as our primary
customer and who our customer actually is
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just coming to the realization
that you can serve one customer really
[SPEAKER_01]: well or one type of customer really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to put most if not all
of your resources towards that customer
[SPEAKER_01]: and customer type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there might be a secondary
customer that you put as little as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible but still serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pretty much after that we just
have to say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is really hard because for us our
intention was to serve market growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the background we came out
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were most passionate about
where we saw the need and what lined up
[SPEAKER_01]: with our interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to do our work our customer
base became somebody else who we still
[SPEAKER_01]: really care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to now learn how to make sure
they're being served really well with as
[SPEAKER_01]: much resources as we have so we can
continue to do our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our second secondary customer of
the market growers, how do we apply enough
[SPEAKER_01]: resources towards them to keep ourselves
passionately engaged but also to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: them not necessarily as our primary
revenue base but maintain them knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's a direction and a customer
base we want to be able to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that it's just a lot being
able to say no a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to have any
choice pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean that's one of the interesting
things about working in a breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: and industry is that we need to be looking
seven years out because of the long time
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes to develop products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it doesn't always work the way it
should but theoretically we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: planning for climate changes and you know
grower changes, agronomic changes seven
[SPEAKER_00]: years out and it's hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to be able to predict the
government from a day to day basis these
[SPEAKER_00]: days versus a year to year basis or
multiple administrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless I mean I think we already are
seeing for example in corn you know being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use a longer maturities more and
more farther north.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an opening up especially in western
Canada of early corn where there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: corn before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's paying attention to grower
changes and cropping changes is really key
[SPEAKER_00]: and that does maybe open up some
opportunities for some you know small
[SPEAKER_00]: startups looking for in those changing
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah I mean there's plenty of examples of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean let's say make your goals somewhat
realistic.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know there's triple zero soybeans
growing in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you say you know we're actually
growing grain corn in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that 10 years ago wasn't even a
thought and you know maybe you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_09]: be trying to grow cotton you know right
here tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know so make it realistic and it's
incremental but like in plant breeding you
[SPEAKER_09]: always find these you always find the
these things that stand out in your field
[SPEAKER_09]: and if selection works you actually select
what you get for.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the thing you pay attention to
that and make sure you know what you're
[SPEAKER_09]: selecting for because if you're selecting
for an alternative trade or an individual
[SPEAKER_09]: indirect trade you're going to get that
indirect trade.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll get genetic gain for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might not be your trade though that
you're looking for but there's plenty
[SPEAKER_09]: plenty of examples of things moving north
you know or different different zones.
[SPEAKER_09]: In bringing a new germplasm like you know
the success of the corn industry and
[SPEAKER_09]: increase in yield at least in my opinion
is really a genetic markers and being able
[SPEAKER_09]: to use tropical germplasm and bring that
in into temperate germplasm.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to get new basically new
heterosis groups that weren't there before
[SPEAKER_09]: and markers basically have done have
allowed breeders to do that because you're
[SPEAKER_09]: able to recoup a temperate high yielding
adapted type fairly quickly with markers
[SPEAKER_09]: and select you know for only the genes
you're interested in and bring in maintain
[SPEAKER_09]: your you know your adapted background.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the opportunities are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're on to something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only speak from the perspective as
center director where we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: applications from a lot of different
places and one of those about two years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago was a crop known as a southern crop
and the focus of the business was to
[SPEAKER_03]: winterize it in such a way that it could
be grown north and it was an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: concept and it proved out from our center
vetting and screening perspective and we
[SPEAKER_03]: were prepared to bring this company in but
we couldn't because they got so much
[SPEAKER_03]: venture funding to support their work that
they automatically graduated before we
[SPEAKER_03]: could bring them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can do the same go for it sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I was just going to say in the marine
plant area we're prepared for that right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Warm temperate species moving up the coast
they give new opportunities part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: RPE new program that is in process now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were very cognizant about looking at
the Gulf of Mexico the southeast U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the opportunities to extend in
the open water areas there and they use
[SPEAKER_04]: global climatic change as a very important
part of understanding what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that was in part why I put those
last two slides in my presentation because
[SPEAKER_04]: you you know you can't stay underwater
it's it's happening there and but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: some really interesting opportunities if
you know your marine plants to take
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to think for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean I was I was involved for about a
decade in a drought breeding program as
[SPEAKER_00]: part in pioneer and I think that those
kind of activities in building maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: stability to our yield that is kind of
just a baseline of any genetics even the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest yielding genetics is really what
we need to be working towards is expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a huge drought every X number
of years those X will then decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: through time so we'll have droughts and
then floods and then I mean that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: volatility we're looking at and you you
just need to build that in as as a base
[SPEAKER_00]: platform I'd say into genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you know looking at opportunities
in genome editing and or continuing with
[SPEAKER_00]: with biotechnology traits to just have
that as a as a background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just we need to do that as breeders
I think and it comes with trade-offs we
[SPEAKER_00]: may see peak yields coming off in order to
maintain those that yield stability
[SPEAKER_00]: through time and that's something that the
market will probably adjust to as maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you know having a certain level of yield
year over year becomes a higher you know
[SPEAKER_00]: of higher value than having one peak year
of yield in this more volatile context.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll echo previous comments I think one of
the most important classes I took in grad
[SPEAKER_00]: school was actually in the in the business
school I was kind of bored in grad school
[SPEAKER_00]: so I just went and took business school
classes and now in industry it's I find it
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely important and in that we pretty
much have to pitch our ideas and somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: VC style discussion all the time to upper
upper management we have to give the same
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to borrow the car for the night
discussion endlessly it's not a grant
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal because it's much more informal
than that it's so it's a you know hallway
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion other things so how to give
those kind of talks how to speak the
[SPEAKER_00]: language of management I think is probably
key whether you're small big or on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_09]: To build on that it's communication you
need to build your network and you know
[SPEAKER_09]: you have to talk to people and even if
you're an introvert or not it's going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be really hard to make connections if
you're not talking to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the same point you have to
have the elevator speech so you just met
[SPEAKER_09]: the CEO of a venture capital company or
another company literally going up the
[SPEAKER_09]: elevator or you know you have a five
minute break at coffee and you just happen
[SPEAKER_09]: to be talking to this person what are you
going to say you know so you need to have
[SPEAKER_09]: that you know in your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: As growly as I may have made the process
at the center appear I encourage grad
[SPEAKER_03]: students to consider entrepreneurship and
and I welcome their inquiries because at
[SPEAKER_03]: least in my own experience working with
grad students young faculty members those
[SPEAKER_03]: who go in to explore the application of
their work from the lab and try to follow
[SPEAKER_03]: it out into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take from that experience color that that
alters your perception of your own work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most times for the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see your work in a greater context.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see your work move out into the
marketplace or move out and actually do
[SPEAKER_03]: good things for lots of people and that's
that's immensely satisfying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there is a dark side to this equation
and sometimes it goes awry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to do this and
maintain your scientific objectivity and
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that at root you are a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do follow truth as you see it in
your laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because the business world will
challenge you and sometimes suborn you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that happens then you're lost both
as a scientist as well as you're of little
[SPEAKER_03]: use to your company because you become
sort of mere twaddle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's that's the potential
tragedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you gain otherwise as a scientist
through that broader view of your work is
[SPEAKER_03]: really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you can see the light bulbs go off
and that's immensely gratifying.
[SPEAKER_04]: One take how blessed it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard an awful lot about business
but as students go to scientific meetings
[SPEAKER_04]: go as diverse meetings that you can as
much you can get funding for or go after
[SPEAKER_04]: the scholarships grants whatever you can
because that's when you can get some ideas
[SPEAKER_04]: and the lights will go off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you guys need at this particular
point the meal ticket and you know the
[SPEAKER_04]: meal ticket for a student is publications.
[SPEAKER_04]: So try to keep all the different you know
balls up in the air and see where they
[SPEAKER_04]: land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't fall short of knowing your
science and participating in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately you all have the science
background and the beating the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: background going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started with none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say be really ready to continue
your learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be really open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ready to work a lot harder if you're
starting your own business than you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: did in grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ready for failure and just think small
and dream big and you know one step at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time and you can get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closing statements.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I don't get out of it after all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I would say that as an
introvert's introvert in an academic
[SPEAKER_05]: institution there's still no getting away
from entrepreneurship because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying all the time to sell ideas in the
form of grant applications or you're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to assess stakeholders and decide
if you're actually doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me stakeholders are Midwestern
growers you know of soybeans.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they actually need.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they what do the growers in
Minnesota need and how is that different
[SPEAKER_05]: from the growers in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are the needs changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that requires actually talking to all
of those people which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been it's been a gratifying part of
the career.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
