[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to start out right away by
thanking my lab group and the funding
[SPEAKER_01]: source for the information I'm going to be
sharing with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, in my lab, I have Ruth
Jenger, who runs a program for organic
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers out of my group, very
independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she lets me be a part of it too
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my students, Jenna Lind,
Eric, Anna Christina, Azale, and
[SPEAKER_01]: Christina, who four of them are working on
bacterial-related projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Anna Christina is our virologist
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also wanted to thank really all
the staff, but particularly Andy
[SPEAKER_01]: Weatherall, Rick Weber, Rick Haffner,
and Keith Heinzen, who are in our seed
[SPEAKER_01]: potato program, because they also help a
lot when we want samples collected in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help us rate field plots and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to start out talking actually
about the seed program and then to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce the pathogen, the group that I'm
going to be describing today, and to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you why we're interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm located in Madison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our commercial potatoes are grown
in the central sands right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our seed growers are up in Annego
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the university farm is up in
Rhineland, where there's a highway that
[SPEAKER_01]: just runs straight up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent a lot of my time driving up and
down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things basically, like everything,
they run downhill, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seed potatoes grown in Rhineland
are sold to Annego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are generally sold everywhere south.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other key thing that's going on in
Wisconsin is the potato germplasm center
[SPEAKER_01]: is here in Sturgeon Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the US collection of diverse potato
genotypes is easily accessible right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 1,000 acres, so it's actually
larger than the Madison campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly woods and a couple of lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four greenhouses, about 100 acres,
90 acres of potatoes every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a three-year rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tend to irrigate out of this lake
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really beautiful place to
visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of wildlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been followed by wolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I stole all those pictures from
National Geographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't have the really important
wildlife that we have up in the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have any photos of these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I first started, I was trained as
a bacteriologist in Allen's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to work on bacteria,
because that's what I knew how to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew we had cactobacterium or soft
rot erwinia in the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were irrigating with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like that could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sending these potatoes all over
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are they produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: And was there actually a problem when you
irrigate with water containing a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything comes up to that farm in
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send tens of thousands of these little
plants up there every year from the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: These should be pathogen-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get put into a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grow about 300,000 to 400,000
mini-tubers this way every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little guys are planted in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we harvest from them is sold to
the farmers to support the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we replant it and sell it to the second
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if all goes well, then they have
warehouses full of seed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, in the seed system,
soft rot's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's because they don't stress
the plants for size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they store them at a cooler
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see it, but we don't see it as a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In commercial farming, though,
it is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to either be a problem right
as they're emerging, if we have violent
[SPEAKER_01]: storms, which happen a lot in Wisconsin,
or at this stage when the whole warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: will just rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a significant issue, but not
generally with the growers I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also certify all the seed potatoes from
a regulatory program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works out to about 7.5% of the
total potatoes produced in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to show you a little bit of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized just a few years ago in an
amazing, we never throw anything away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this amazing data set that goes
back decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, we have a lot of information on what
it actually costs to produce a crop of
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes and what the diseases actually
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've been keeping these budgets
for years, and we were throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started publishing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can go back to these reports
and see whether soft rot's a big deal or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the page, it shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really the biggest thing we worry
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some kind of fun graphs out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we can track reduction in
disease over the past 60 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reduction in human error over the past
60 years in farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So disease goes down with a half-life of
about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farming, the half-life is about the
same as a generation of farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about 26 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this data set, from our
certification data, it's just about four
[SPEAKER_01]: of them that have to fill out their seed
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell that PBY right now is the
number one reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a potato virus-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the number one reason for seed
certification, rejections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the basis for why I'm really
here today, because of this project with
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuart, and why I might be becoming a
virologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: This really struck me, until we put this
graph together ahead and realized this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the other main reason for rejections
are the mistakes that the farmers make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually a bigger issue than
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, some of these PBY rejections
are probably due to farmers making
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have become, I understand more now
why maybe social sciences need to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we should be thinking about how
farmers make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also try to control disease,
or get them to adopt control methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other place where we see a lot of
things coming out of the field besides
[SPEAKER_01]: seed production is, again, Ruth Judger's
program on organic potato production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she works with now 38 farmers between
Ohio and North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run variety trialing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all very applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what varieties work best for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we get them seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: How should they be controlling disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you grow potatoes without
irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get a lot of disease incidence
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this table shows, all these tiny
little numbers, it's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's, what percent of the lots
from 2013 did we have a lot of culls off
[SPEAKER_01]: that field due to a certain disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, Adirondack blue,
silver scurvy was our main problem in most
[SPEAKER_01]: of our lots from the farms we got data
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soft rot is never a big deal,
but it's constantly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at harvest, it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you try to store things,
it can become a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pectobacteria, bacterial soft rot,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ground negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the entrobacteriaceae family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the same as E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think of them sort of like a
plant pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the tools that work with E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli will also work with pectobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call it Adirwinian keratopera,
the softer Adirwinian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this family has a lot of human and
plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They often have insect vectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really common in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easy to, the family tends to be
very easy to get out of water and soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and off of plants and off of
people and cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have simple circular five megabase
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sometimes have plasmids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soft rot bacteria that we work with,
plasmids don't seem to be an important
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have this five megabase circle
in their genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been grouping them, we call it
the PDD clades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pectobacteria, dickeyia,
and brenaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these three genera seem to form a group
of plant pathogens, entrobacteriaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pectobacteria and dickeyia are broad host
range soft rot pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they cause decay and wilt type
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a whole bunch of different species of
dicots and monocots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then brenaria has been almost
unstudied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think of it, it infects things like
willow trees and walnut trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently cantaloupe has been
found to be a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't tend to think of it as
pectolytic or causing soft rot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we really don't know very much about
this genus at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is a typical example of a
potato that has soft rot from the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this spot right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been what was connected to
the stolen or the stuff that connects the
[SPEAKER_01]: tuber to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be where the bacteria,
we often see evidence that they've gone in
[SPEAKER_01]: through the stolen and into the tuber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also just want you to think about,
this is a really nice anaerobic chamber,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gone in, they can't digest the
skim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got their own little protective
food source in the soil that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get very high concentrations of
bacteria here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to emphasize that these are
broad host range necrotrophs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm guessing there's a lot of
people here in this audience and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't try to make this fit the
Pseudomonas syringae model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get this a lot when we try to submit
papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have examples of gene for gene
resistance, for example, that we know of
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have evidence that these
pathogens are suppressing plant defenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they seem to perhaps induce cell
death and benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do cause cell death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very different from Pseudomonas
syringae, which there's lots of examples
[SPEAKER_01]: of gene for gene resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very active in suppressing plant
defenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do cause cell death eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not what happens first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to point out this symptom,
because it's one that I had really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated until I started working with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that these guys do is try
to plant yellow like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that in the field is like a
bright yellow spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are they in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be very good at colonizing
the vascular system, specifically the
[SPEAKER_01]: xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a potato stem that's been
inoculated with GFP-labeled bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you in a second why we think
those are xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this in field samples,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The xylem will turn black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the center part of the stem will also
turn black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bacteria are in between the
cells, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a stem cut more longitudinally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the bacteria in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the kind of screen-like
structure of the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what strikes me with this is the high
density of the bacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really packed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they actually, the structure of
the xylem is still intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That surprised me, too, because I thought
if a software pathogen would break down
[SPEAKER_01]: the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not doing that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the cells within the
stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully what you can see is that the
bacteria tend to be around the edges of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just necessarily collapsing
everything right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do occasionally get inside a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see them swimming around like
crazy in these cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another difference between
Pseudomonas syringae, which you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably more familiar with, and
Pectobacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys tend to be modal in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut their flagella, and they're
swimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes doing growth curves a challenge,
because the bacteria don't stay at all
[SPEAKER_01]: where you put them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I wanted to point out
is the density inside the cell is never
[SPEAKER_01]: like it gets into the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the big difference here
between which GMP is there and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit about what we know,
how these guys interact with plants at a
[SPEAKER_01]: more larger level.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started in Madison, I had to switch
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to work with something on
potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had an M2 lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing I did was run out
with Walt Stevenson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we visited a bunch of fields and
storages where they had soft-trap
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire time, he was trying to talk me
into working on common scab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that just seemed too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we collected a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just trying to get a collection
to start working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first surprise we got is that what
we were finding out in the field wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: just Pectobacterium keratogrom or
Pectobacterium androcepticum, which were
[SPEAKER_01]: the species we'd expected to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found a lot of other clades of
Pectobacterium also causing disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are examples of what we commonly
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Pectobacterium keratogrom,
keratogrom, or subspecies Brazilianis,
[SPEAKER_01]: or subspecies Orniferum, or Pectobacterium
wassabiii, which until then we thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: a pathogen of wassabi and not a potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't found Pectobacterium
androcepticum yet in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because our summers are so
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the take-home point here is that
multiple species tend to be present in a
[SPEAKER_01]: field in some times in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've done then in our lab
group is we're trying to focus less on the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that differ between the species and
more on what does that genus have in
[SPEAKER_01]: common since we're going to find multiple
species within a field anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a representation of a
phylogenetic tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to remind me to tell you that I
work very closely with a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers at UW campus, and one of them
is Nicole Perna, who's a bio, very
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in bioinformatics and in the
evolution of this bacterial family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Alan is the one who introduced us,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both started at UW at about the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of what I'm going to tell you
about today is from this collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things Nicole did was she
sequenced a big chunk of our culture
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had money from biofuels money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure you can defend the choice
of sequencing software bacteria for
[SPEAKER_01]: biofuels research, but I was happy she did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these genome sequences went
into her database, so this is publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each gene and each microbe has its own
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get the sequence, the protein
sequence, the map, where that gene is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is her belt, which is a regulator for
the type 3 secretion system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything we know about that
gene that people have bothered to put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So motifs, publications related to that
gene, and all the other homologs within
[SPEAKER_01]: the database you can quickly link to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been really valuable for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to show you a few things that
we've been doing with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where this 300 genome title
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been doing an analysis of 307 of
the genomes that are in here and
[SPEAKER_01]: annotated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the things that we've been able
to do with this is we have a student,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bing, who developed a supervised machine
learning program to tell us what genes
[SPEAKER_01]: were likely to be involved in plant
microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a lot of genes with no known
function and no clear way to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what the function is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she basically took all the data in this
database and used it as a training set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning of this project,
I didn't really know how do you describe
[SPEAKER_01]: what supervised machine learning is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they described it to us,
to my lab group, was it's like Netflix,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Netflix will learn what you like and make
suggestions on what other movie you might
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically what this program
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It learns from the training set what a
gene involved in plant microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions looks like, and then it
suggests other genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will rank them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a training set with Dikia
Dedeati and then tried it with
[SPEAKER_01]: Pectobacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's Nicole and Jeremy working on
this related project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's sort of a program that
replaces the lab PI, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now we've got a ranked list of
things that students should be working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to tell the students anymore
what genes to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what one of my students is
now doing is trying to figure out if the
[SPEAKER_01]: program actually worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's using the ranked list and trying
to see if he can detect that these genes
[SPEAKER_01]: are involved in plant microbe
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at all the ones with no
known function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's just taking a random list
and seeing if the machine is doing any
[SPEAKER_01]: better than just choosing them randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, while we were working on this
stuff, I noticed that these sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: papers were coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is from a group in Finland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they reported a Pectobacterium
wassavia sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they reported the sequence of their
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they also included the ones out
of our collection, because we never
[SPEAKER_01]: bothered publishing anything on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called up Nicole to maybe we should
start publishing something on our genome
[SPEAKER_01]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been sitting out there for a
while, and nobody's doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know how things are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a student to work on this
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were both busy with other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a year later, she sends me this email,
which is all you're supposed to see here
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's really, really long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the key part of this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have some data for you to mull
over in your spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hope is that you will look at these
and have a meeting and profound insights
[SPEAKER_01]: and key evolutionary innovations in this
clade.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was, of course, joking there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here was the key part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to stop reading now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put this away for two months,
because it was so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the file that she sent was so
complicated, I just could not deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we had a really, really cold
winter in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't much that anybody could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally opened it up again in
January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had sent this Excel file that had
all these extensive comparisons between
[SPEAKER_01]: 307 genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she wanted to know, could we make
a story out of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I spent the next six months looking
at this, trying to figure out what did it
[SPEAKER_01]: mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what would you do with this kind of
comparison?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my background, again, is more mutating
genes and looking at the biology of things
[SPEAKER_01]: and not in bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt like I was a first year grad
student trying to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this mural here as inspiration a lot
for what we do in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there any Madison people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys recognize this?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Mifflin Street co-op,
the old co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a mural that's painted of the
idealized food system that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an example of where you would
find enterobacteria in the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the water and the soil and the
plants we eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got genomes from this
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can we learn from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to focus on two questions
because we only wanted to write one paper
[SPEAKER_01]: the right way we were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nicole's main interest is this clade
of bacteria that includes the soft drop
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in the brenaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is their common ancestor?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think they were either related to
the common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Yersinia as the next closest
relative or E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so could we figure that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been trying to do this for the last
15 years without a clear answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all of these genomes, can we find the
right set of genes to give us that answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was interested in, Roboto was
interested in, can we identify genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: were acquired by this common ancestor that
helped this clade become plant pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to become the type of plant pathogen
that they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would those genes look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a good figure for this
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question that Nicole had is,
is it derived from a common ancestor
[SPEAKER_01]: that's similar to Yersinia or T.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella because we don't have
the answer yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out two thirds of the genes
support one answer and one third support a
[SPEAKER_01]: different answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she can't figure out how to do the
statistics to decide if any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: signals are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's working right now with a status
physician to try to answer what seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: a simple question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were at least able to get a good
idea of how the strains within the clade
[SPEAKER_01]: were, this group were related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we try to go after this question
instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what genes are more common in this
group of bacteria than another
[SPEAKER_01]: entrobacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big piece of what's in the
six-sol file.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we wanted to see, OK,
if we get this class of genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: does it match any of the other data sets
we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So do they tend to be regulated by corn
sensing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they tend to be expressed in plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they tend to be things that some
machine learning program picked up so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can take the set and put it against all
these other sets of data that we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first things that surprised
me or I thought was interesting is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the genes that we identified as more
commonly found in this group of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens than other entrobacteria tended
to be near tRNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't tend to be linked to
really obvious mobile evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not completely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was one thing that really stood
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if I was teaching a class,
I'd divide you into groups of five right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and ask you to write a list of genes
that are probably more common in this
[SPEAKER_01]: group of plant pathogens than related
animal pathogens or environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's some symptom pictures I've
shown you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think you would find?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant cell wall degrading enzymes,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was definitely in the set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing I wanted to show
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this felt good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have found the plant cell wall
degrading enzymes that are responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: the symptoms we see with this group of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what spit out the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really helpful, though,
to see this complete list from the 20
[SPEAKER_01]: plant pathogen genomes we were looking at
and then comparing it to the 280-some
[SPEAKER_01]: other genomes, because it helped us figure
out what the loci are and get some idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: how these may have been acquired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, there's 21 loci encoding
plant cell wall degrading enzymes in both
[SPEAKER_01]: clodicea and ectobacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's six in Brunaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see so many plant cell
wall degrading enzymes in these genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: that I hadn't been thinking of as
hecolytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these six, there's one that's widely
present in the entrobacteria ACA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in Yersinia and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got LW, and there's
pectin-methylesterase here, and then an
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I thought was
really interesting on these six conserved
[SPEAKER_01]: loci that are in these three genera,
they're really diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a pectate lyse, there's two
cellulases, there's a polyglot dronics,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pectinacilesterase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this might possibly be
involved in plant cell wall degrading
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two, but nobody's looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an all-acid decarboxylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just one of these examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been struggling as we've been trying
to write this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we not have 50 figures in this
paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the key things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found that as a struggle,
and I was trying to describe this,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a typical example of what one
of these loci would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brunaria will have one of the genes,
and then one or the other of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: two genera will have several other plant
cell wall degrading enzymes of different
[SPEAKER_01]: classes stuck into that locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, for example, endicchia,
there's three pectate lyces, this
[SPEAKER_01]: conserved pY, and then a pectin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the subsequent acquisitions beyond
these six loci tend to be enzymes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: still within those same six classes with a
few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't see enzyme types that are in
one endicchia but non-pectobacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have the same types of
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although not necessarily the same enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still left with the question
people have been asking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the benefit of having all these
loci dedicated to the plant cell wall
[SPEAKER_01]: degrading enzymes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it's analogous to the story
that we see with the effectors in the type
[SPEAKER_01]: III secretion system, if the plants are
defending against these enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that plants can make inhibitors
that affect these enzymes, and that cell
[SPEAKER_01]: wall composition differs among plant
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they do need to keep acquiring
enzymes to maintain a broad host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get back to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to just touch on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something, we published one paper
in this area, we're still working a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do these analyses, some sets of
genes just keep popping to the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: list all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is this fermentation
pathway that ends in either acetone or
[SPEAKER_01]: butanedyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every analysis we did, this came up
right at the top as something interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we finally looked at it more carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will tie back to the pectate
lysin in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very small gene cluster that's
got a regulatory gene and then three
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that take, it's the mixed acid
fermentation pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts with pyruvate and then goes
to either one of these two endpoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on whether that gene's present
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't in all of the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've taken an intramicro course,
you've probably played with this reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what the Vogts-Crosker reaction
detects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a way that we tell if coliform
bacteria, like E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella, are present in water
samples, for example, versus
[SPEAKER_01]: enterobacteria that we don't have to worry
about that are plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this pathway is present in a lot
of the environmental ones, like
[SPEAKER_01]: pectobacteria, but absent from the human
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out these compounds are
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've been kind of ignored by a
lot of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're volatiles that act as insect
caramels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They inhibit the ethylene response in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are pre-alkaline, so they raise
the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes back to soft-wrap
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because under anaerobic conditions,
this pathway's really odd and the potato
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes more, but the environment becomes
more alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant cell wall degrading enzymes
are really only active at pH 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a way for the... If the bacteria
didn't have this pathway, those enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: would be no good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this shows is a... This has been a
production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_00]: web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
