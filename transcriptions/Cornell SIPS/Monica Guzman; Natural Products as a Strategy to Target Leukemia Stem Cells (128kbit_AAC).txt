[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, and I would like to first
start by thanking Eloy for the invitation
[SPEAKER_05]: and the opportunity to talk to you about
the work I do in the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, I'm going to focus on one of the
lines of investigation we have in the lab,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is in natural products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really glad to say that because of
that meeting with Eloy when I joined
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornell almost six years ago, I couldn't
fight anymore and said, OK, we'll work on
[SPEAKER_05]: natural products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought I was going to stop
working natural products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some work on natural products on my
PhD and postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to mention it today.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought, OK, that's going to be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move on to better and newer
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm back to natural products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm very happy that I visited
that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a brief outline of what I'm going
to discuss today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to tell you about what are
cancer stem cells, specifically what is
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia, what are leukemia stem cells,
and the way I see what are the challenges
[SPEAKER_05]: on eliminating leukemia stem cells,
the compounds that we're using to target
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cells, the strategies we're
using to deliver these compounds in
[SPEAKER_05]: animals at this point, and other natural
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to begin with describing
what cancer stem cells are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, the best analogy to think about
is plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're talking about plants,
plants is the best analogy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not just plants, weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess you here in Ithaca are more
familiar with this view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Us in New York, we never see this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like to dream that that's what I
would like to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we typically see weeds in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are annoying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want our grass to be really green.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we think is the best way to
eliminate that weed is come with the lawn
[SPEAKER_05]: mower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the weed is gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we all know that that's not going
to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't get rid of that root,
that weed is going to come back and be
[SPEAKER_05]: there again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cancer stem cells are pretty much the
same thing, are the root of the disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the root of the cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to eliminate that cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to eliminate that root.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I specifically focus on leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in general, leukemia is considered a
rare disease when it's compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: prostate cancer or breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It affects around 300,000 people in the
US.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is estimated that around 54,000 people
will be diagnosed with leukemia this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's expected that around 24,000
people will die of this disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where leukemia comes from, I would like
to first describe the hematopoietic system
[SPEAKER_05]: so we can discuss leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the blood system is highly
regenerative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, it's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about how many cells
we're producing every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put this slide just as an example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because every time I look at this slide,
I go, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter how many times I see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these numbers are real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as an example, 2.4 million new
erythrocytes are made per second.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we're speaking, we're just making tons
and tons and tons and tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And probably, with exercise, we're making
even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So neutrophils is a most abundant white
blood cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 5 billion neutrophils are produced
every hour of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you notice, also, the lifespan of
these cells is very short.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to keep this highly regenerative
system, you need a very powerful cell that
[SPEAKER_05]: can maintain this every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this powerful cell is what we know as
a pluripotent stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pluripotent stem cell is a cell that
can give rise to a lymphoid progenitor and
[SPEAKER_05]: myeloid progenitor.
[SPEAKER_05]: These cells have a very high capacity of
self-renewal and can give rise to these
[SPEAKER_05]: progenitors that are more committed to
give rise to mature blood cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as they differentiate into the
hierarchy, the ability to self-renewal
[SPEAKER_05]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine this has to be tightly
regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what happens when this regulation is
mutated or something goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_05]: you stop making mature blood cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happens is immature blood cells
accumulate in the blood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is what we call or known
about leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So leukemia is an accumulation of immature
blood cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are known as leukemic blasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could be of the myeloid system or the
lymphoid hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then it will be the myeloid leukemias
or lymphoid leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: My laboratory specifically focuses on
myeloid leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the origin of leukemia?
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been hypothesized that either a
hematopoietic stem cell or a hematopoietic
[SPEAKER_05]: progenitor will have one, two,
or more oncogenic events that will give
[SPEAKER_05]: rise to a leukemia stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: This leukemia stem cell also has a
capacity to self-renew and give rise to
[SPEAKER_05]: progenitors, in this case, leukemic
progenitors, which in turn will give rise
[SPEAKER_05]: to the leukemic blast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I want you to think is not where
leukemia comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want you to think is how
heterogeneous leukemia is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a single patient, you're going to
have leukemic blasts, leukemic
[SPEAKER_05]: progenitors, and leukemic stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem becomes then when you look
at the outcomes of patients with AML or
[SPEAKER_05]: acute myelogenous leukemia, which is what
I would like you to focus on because this
[SPEAKER_05]: is a big problem and that's the reason we
work on AML.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the past, 40 years, you can see that
the outcomes of AML are real poor and they
[SPEAKER_05]: have not changed at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see in 1973 and 2002, 2008,
the curves are pretty much on top of each
[SPEAKER_05]: other.
[SPEAKER_05]: In patients over 55 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is not because the therapy
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason is because standard of care
works in the sense that most patients with
[SPEAKER_05]: AML when they go to standard induction,
they will go into remission.
[SPEAKER_05]: So around 85% of patients that get
chemotherapy will achieve complete
[SPEAKER_05]: remission.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is that most of these patients
are going to relapse very rapidly and then
[SPEAKER_05]: die of disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what the outcomes are always
poor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what the therapy has not
changed because there is nothing so far
[SPEAKER_05]: that is better than that 85%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason we like to think is because
this, again, this heterogeneity on the
[SPEAKER_05]: cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens is the patient comes with AML
and then undergoes current standard of
[SPEAKER_05]: care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that there's disease left
behind and we like to call that minimal
[SPEAKER_05]: residual disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's minimal residual disease because
we know it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in many cases, it's very hard to
detect unless we can track annotation and
[SPEAKER_05]: other features of that particular
leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the cases, there's still a
black box, but we know there's disease
[SPEAKER_05]: left behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the patient relapses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would like to think that the reason
that the patient relapses is because there
[SPEAKER_05]: are leukemia stem cells left behind,
which again have the capacity to self
[SPEAKER_05]: renew and give rise to disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my focus has been to try to find and
identify differences between a leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: stem cell and a normal hematopoietic stem
cell in order to be able to eliminate
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cells without harming normal
hematopoietic stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So stem cells can be identified by
immunophenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm here putting the immunophenotype I
knew when I started doing this research
[SPEAKER_05]: many, many years ago, which they were
pretty much identical.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were defined as C34 positive,
C38 negative, HLA VR negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the clinical implication?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, you tell me all these very nice
hypotheses, but is there actually clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: evidence that suggests that this
population is important?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is many papers that have shown that
patients that have high proportions of C34
[SPEAKER_05]: positive, C38 negative cells in the bone
marrow or in the peripheral blood,
[SPEAKER_05]: it always correlates with poor outcomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So patients do worse if they have high
proportions of this population of cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would the high stem cell frequency
correlate with poor outcomes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to show you the experiments we
did to demonstrate that leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells work as a system to chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before describing those experiments,
I want to briefly describe the assay just
[SPEAKER_05]: in case people are not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do is take both leukemia cells,
we treat them with sitarabin or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: drug of choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we stain the cells with annexing and
severing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a cell that is alive and intact,
you have phosphatidylserine, a
[SPEAKER_05]: phospholipid in the inner leaflet of the
membrane of the cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the DNA in the nucleus will be
inaccessible because the cell is intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: As the cell starts undergoing apoptosis,
what is going to happen is the
[SPEAKER_05]: phosphatidylserine is going to flip to the
outside leaflet of the cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then annexing can bind to that
phosphatidylserine and stain that cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: As the cell continues the process of cell
death, then the nucleus becomes available
[SPEAKER_05]: because the cell becomes very permeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 7AAD, which is a DNA dye,
will stain the nucleus and the cell will
[SPEAKER_05]: know that the cell is dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we mark these cells, which are annexing
negative, 7AAD negative as live cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we observe when we take total bulk
AML and treat with sitarabin, which is the
[SPEAKER_05]: drug that is used for standard of care,
we see that this drug works.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see more than 50% of the cells are
actually dying or dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the conclusion is, yes, this drug is
actually working.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what happens is if we focus on
leukemia stem cell populations,
[SPEAKER_05]: the finest 34 positive, 38 negative
population, you see these cells are
[SPEAKER_05]: intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the cells are not touched by this
chemotherapy and they're still surviving.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why are they surviving?
[SPEAKER_05]: When we look at cells that are more
mature, the finest 34 positive,
[SPEAKER_05]: 38 positive, and label them with a
proliferation marker known as KI67,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can see that their cells are
proliferating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in contrast, when you look at the
leukemia stem cells, 34 positive,
[SPEAKER_05]: 38 negative cells, most of them are
quiescent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not proliferating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think about the chemotherapy
when it was designed, it was designed on
[SPEAKER_05]: the basis that cancer cells grow very
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the best way to eliminate this
cancer was to block their ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: proliferate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these cells do not proliferate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, they cannot be eliminated by
standard of care that targets
[SPEAKER_05]: proliferating cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when we compare the quiescence of
leukemia stem cell, that's a feature that
[SPEAKER_05]: is shared with hematopoietic stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So both of them are quiescent,
so we cannot just pick a rot that will
[SPEAKER_05]: kill quiescent cells, because that will
harm normal hematopoietic cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as an example, I'm showing you
citarabine, which is the standard of care,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the worst of both things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does a pretty bad job of killing
leukemia stem cells and does a decent job
[SPEAKER_05]: at harming normal hematopoietic stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it cannot discriminate between these
two populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore, it's not a good drug to
kill leukemia stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was how everything started over 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we know more markers that can
distinguish a leukemia stem cell from a
[SPEAKER_05]: normal hematopoietic stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all labeled in green are the
markers that are found positive in either
[SPEAKER_05]: cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in red are labeled the markers that
are absent in either cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see there are a good number of
markers that can distinguish a leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: stem cell from a normal hematopoietic stem
cell, and the list will keep growing and
[SPEAKER_05]: growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I have to tell you the
disclaimer, which is these will change in
[SPEAKER_05]: patient to patient to patient to patient,
because we are all different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And leukemia stem cells are also different
between patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the best way to define a leukemia stem
cell will be by function.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do in the lab is perform
functional assays, which means it
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluates the ability of a leukemia stem
cell or a progenitor cell to give rise to
[SPEAKER_05]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of these assays is the colony
forming assay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The colony forming assay, what it does,
it measures the ability of a progenitor
[SPEAKER_05]: stem cell to give rise to progeny.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the case of hematopoietic cells,
what we see will be normal colonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the case of the leukemic cell,
we'll see leukemic colonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the gold standard assay is what we
know as the xenotransplant assay,
[SPEAKER_05]: which will measure stem cell activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the case of hematopoietic cells,
if we inject them in immunodeficient mice,
[SPEAKER_05]: we will see normal hematopoiesis,
normal human hematopoiesis in the mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the case of leukemia, what we will
see is leukemia in this mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the best way to prove that it's indeed
a cell that has the ability to self-renew
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to do serial transplantation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you should be able to propagate
the disease again and again and again and
[SPEAKER_05]: again and again forever and ever if you
have a stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the assays that we use in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on that, then the next thing is
can we find molecular features that can
[SPEAKER_05]: identify a leukemia stem cell from a
normal hematopoietic stem cell and take
[SPEAKER_05]: advantage of that feature to fill the
cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we found that feature, and that feature
is NF kappa B.
[SPEAKER_05]: NF kappa B is a transcription factor that
is involved in growth and survival
[SPEAKER_05]: responses in tumors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way it works is in a normal cell,
NF kappa B would be found inactive in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cytoplasm of the cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can be maintained inactive by its
inhibitor called I kappa B alpha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon a stimuli that could be many
different types of stimuli like infection,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, in the case of normal cells,
I kappa B alpha will get phosphorylated
[SPEAKER_05]: and then degraded by the proteasome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leaving NF kappa B free, we go to the
nucleus and start the transcription of
[SPEAKER_05]: genes involved in survival, proliferation,
and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what NF kappa B does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we found was that in a few mixed
stem cells, NF kappa B was constitutively
[SPEAKER_05]: activated in the nucleus, shown here by a
DNA binding assay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in contrast, normal hematopoietic
cells do not have NF kappa B
[SPEAKER_05]: constitutively active.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we found this first, we were not
surprised that NF kappa B was
[SPEAKER_05]: constitutively active in an EML because it
already had been reported to be critical
[SPEAKER_05]: for the survival and proliferation of
tumors, many other tumors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what actually surprised me was when we
look at the very primitive quiescent stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells, NF kappa B was also constitutively
active.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these cells are quiescent, are resting,
but yet they have this transcription
[SPEAKER_05]: factor constitutively on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that led us to think and hypothesize,
can we use this unique characteristic to
[SPEAKER_05]: eliminate leukemia stem cells?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we target NF kappa B to selectively
eliminate leukemia stem cells without
[SPEAKER_05]: harming normal hematopoietic stem cells?
[SPEAKER_05]: So to do this, we turn to plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use this compound called
parthenolide, which is derived from a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant known as feverfuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's called feverfuel because it has
been used for many years to decrease
[SPEAKER_05]: fevers, as its name says.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has other medicinal uses such as
relieve migraines, endotoxic shock,
[SPEAKER_05]: stomach aches, arthritis, asthma,
skin rashes, tumors, insect repellent,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many uses which feverfuel has
been listed for in ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chemically, it's a cis-puncturine lactone,
and it was well known to be a potent
[SPEAKER_05]: inhibitor of NF kappa B.
[SPEAKER_05]: By now, with all the research we've done
and other groups, we know that
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide also defeats tile and has
many other targets.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the time, it was listed as a very
potent NF kappa B inhibitor, so we tried
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we found is when we use parthenolide
in leukemia stem cells, shown in here,
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw that most of the leukemia cells
from different AML patients, each line
[SPEAKER_05]: represents an AML patient sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: These leukemia stem cells were eliminated
with a concentration of five micromolar of
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: In contrast, when we look at normal
hematopoietic stem cells, you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: these cells at five micromolar
concentration.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were not affected by this compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: This demonstrated that parthenolide can
very effectively eliminate leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells, not having normal hematopoietic
stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is just based by phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also corroborated this using the
functional assays that I mentioned to you,
[SPEAKER_05]: which first we did the colony-forming
assays.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that treatment with
parthenolide decreased very significantly
[SPEAKER_05]: the ability of leukemia cells to give rise
to colonies, but did not affect the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of a normal hematopoietic stem
cells to give rise to normal red blood
[SPEAKER_05]: cell colonies and white blood cell
colonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: More importantly, when we treated the
cells with parthenolide and then
[SPEAKER_05]: transplanted them into amino-deficient
mice to assess the function of these
[SPEAKER_05]: cells, we found that treatment with
parthenolide eliminated the ability of
[SPEAKER_05]: these leukemia stem cells to give rise to
leukemia, but did not affect the ability
[SPEAKER_05]: of normal hematopoietic stem cells to give
rise to normal hematopoiesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this demonstrated that indeed
parthenolide was a very important
[SPEAKER_05]: inhibitor of leukemia stem cell function.
[SPEAKER_05]: We needed to corroborate that the reason
that parthenolide worked was because our
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothesis, we wanted to corroborate that
we're indeed inhibiting NF-kB.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way which I'm going to show it to
you is using a unifluorescence which in a
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cell, NF-kB will be active
in the nucleus and in this case will be
[SPEAKER_05]: staying with yellow, so you'll see it in
the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we expect that if we inhibit
parthenolide, NF-kB should go back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cytoplasm where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we found is indeed that treatment
with parthenolide inhibited effectively
[SPEAKER_05]: NF-kB in these leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other feature that parthenolide
did was a very important induction of
[SPEAKER_05]: reactive oxygen species, in this case
measured with a transcription factor known
[SPEAKER_05]: as nRF2.
[SPEAKER_05]: nRF2 in a control cell will be found in
the cytoplasm, but if this ROS signal gets
[SPEAKER_05]: activated, it will go to the nucleus and
then will activate transcription.
[SPEAKER_05]: And indeed parthenolide resulted in
activation of nRF2 demonstrated that this
[SPEAKER_05]: inducing reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything is very nice and beautiful
and we found something that can kill a
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cell, but of course
parthenolide cannot be used in humans as
[SPEAKER_05]: it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has very poor solubility and
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_05]: In animal studies when parthenolide was
used at 40 milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the maximum amount you can
solubilize this compound, very low amount
[SPEAKER_05]: was detected in the plasma of this mice
which was 200 nanomolar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you remember, I told you we need at
least five micromolar to kill leukemia,
[SPEAKER_05]: so this amount will not be useful to treat
animals or people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those reasons, we started
collaborating with Dr. Peter Crooks to
[SPEAKER_05]: make medicinal analogs to parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we found was the MAPT,
which is a soluble analog of parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just point out here the timeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it takes a long time to go through all
this process to make a medicinal analog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And take it to phase one clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the MAPT is right now in clinical
trials and we're expecting to see what
[SPEAKER_05]: happened with this compound to see if it
actually would kill leukemia stem cells in
[SPEAKER_05]: patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: But since I'm in Ithaca, I would like to
talk about the studies we did in dogs
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think this is very interesting
and very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you guys will appreciate it
more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Than other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use canine leukemias and I have to
point out that this is not a leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cell model.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were advanced spontaneous CD34
positive leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time that we started this
collaboration with, sorry, was a
[SPEAKER_05]: collaboration that was established by
chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what happened is we published the paper
with parthenolide, we received a phone
[SPEAKER_05]: call from a vet and said, hey,
can we use your compound in dogs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dogs have AML and they die very rapidly of
AML.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we try it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought that would be cool,
but we don't know anything about dog
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even know if NFKB would be active
in dog leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the very first thing we did is tested
if NFKB was constitutively active in
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemias of dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did check.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second thing, well,
would parthenolide work in these dog
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemias in vitro?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also tested normal bone marrow from
dogs, healthy dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found that parthenolide was not
harmful to normal hematopoiesis of dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that in hand, we said,
okay, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tested in three dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the end is very small, but I thought
the results would really be and change how
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Parthenolide for clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're three dogs with advanced C34
positive leukemias.
[SPEAKER_05]: We treated them with DMAPT, different
doses, different schedules, because that
[SPEAKER_05]: dose and schedule was dependent on,
I guess, the size of the dog and how far
[SPEAKER_05]: the vet clinic was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we knew all the pharmacology of
DMAPT in dogs because that was a study
[SPEAKER_05]: that was done to take the drug to clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we knew that a dose of 100 milligrams
per kilogram was the maximum tolerated
[SPEAKER_05]: dose for the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even in that sense, we were lucky we
had that information.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took different time points.
[SPEAKER_05]: We collected peripheral blood.
[SPEAKER_05]: We checked the white blood cell counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at C34 because it was the only
marker that we knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are very few markers available
for flow cytometry to look at dog cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also look at our biological
markers, of course, NF kappa B.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, to measure reactive
oxygen species or stress, we use gamma
[SPEAKER_05]: H2AX.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mainly because it cross-reacted with
dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we saw is first we saw an
increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example of one of the dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw a very marked increase on white
blood cell counts after the treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: With DMAPT, 50 milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we saw too was a decrease in the
expression of C34 positive in these
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this data was suggesting to us that the
leukemia cells were differentiating
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially to normal white blood cells
before they died.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we observed was indeed DMAPT was
causing differentiation of leukemic cells
[SPEAKER_05]: in vivo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it was inhibiting NF kappa
B in vivo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these pieces of evidence confirm that
indeed parthenolide inhibits NF kappa B.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the surprise to us was that in vivo,
in dogs, DMAPT was inducing
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiation rather than just immediate
cell death as we saw in vitro.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a major change for how we wrote
the clinical trial because then we thought
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe it's a good idea to first decrease
the white blood cell counts of the patient
[SPEAKER_05]: because you don't want to have tumor lysis
syndrome in people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did observe tumor lysis syndrome in one
of the dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was very lucky, I think,
for us to be able to treat these animals
[SPEAKER_05]: and be able what happens when you have a
spontaneous leukemia where you have dog
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia in dog microenvironment,
which we don't see, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the xenografts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part we're missing when we
treat xenografts because you have human
[SPEAKER_05]: cells in mouse microenvironment,
which is not the same as you see in
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you might wonder what happened with
the leukemia stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the shot we took in the dark
because we don't even know if we could do
[SPEAKER_05]: xenografts of dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we said, well, let's just try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The word that can happen is that nothing
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did is took cells from this ear
of treatment of this dog and then day 12
[SPEAKER_05]: after treatment of the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: We transplanted the cells equal cell
number of leukemia cells in the mouse at
[SPEAKER_05]: day zero and in the mouse from day 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we measured the ability of these cells
to give rise to leukemia in these mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we found was a significant
decrease in the ability of these leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: cells to give rise to leukemia in the
mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did next is do serial
transplantation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I told you, the stem cell will be
able to recapitulate the disease forever
[SPEAKER_05]: and ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we observed is when we serially
transplanted these cells, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: equal cell numbers for dog cells for these
mice, we saw a significant decrease.
[SPEAKER_05]: The significant decrease was even stronger
when the cells were serially transplanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: This data strongly suggested that
parthenolide was indeed targeting leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: stem cells in these animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're just waiting to see what
happens with the clinical trials with
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still undergoing, but we expect
to see similar observations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the end points that we're going to
take are going to be very similar to what
[SPEAKER_05]: we did in the dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this all was very nice, but we're
still trying to think that it's very rare
[SPEAKER_05]: ways to take these compounds that are not
soluble, that have very poor
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacological properties, if there is a
way to take them faster to the clinic and
[SPEAKER_05]: closer to where leukemia stem cells
reside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So leukemia stem cells live in the bone
marrow, and they like to hide on top of
[SPEAKER_05]: being chemoresistant and quiescent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also like to hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to hide in the low-steel region
of the bone marrow, where they're also
[SPEAKER_05]: further protected from chemotherapeutic
drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we thought is why we don't take
parthenolide as a proof of principle and
[SPEAKER_05]: use nanoparticles to take parthenolide to
the bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was in collaboration with Haifa Shen.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is in Houston.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the parthenolide, we put it in
micelles.
[SPEAKER_05]: These micelles are covered with silicon
particles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these particles are covered with
E-selecting thioectomer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The E-selecting thioectomer will guide
this nanoparticle all the way to the
[SPEAKER_05]: low-steel region of the bone marrow,
as it will find E-selectin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then very slowly, they deliver the
drug in that area where leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells reside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before telling you about what happened,
I want to compare and contrast how we use
[SPEAKER_05]: the nanoparticles with how we use the
soluble compound I tell you about,
[SPEAKER_05]: the DMAPT.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in mice, the half-life of DMAPT is only
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the dose that we thought we had to use
to achieve the five micromolar
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration is 100 milligrams per
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to give it three times a day or
a little bash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you get an idea, each syringe
represents a dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was opposed to it when I was doing
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that was not fun for me or
for the mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody was having fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the worst part, and I'm not going to
show it here, is in another paper that was
[SPEAKER_05]: already published, the DMAPT in mice by
itself cannot eliminate tumor burden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to combine it with another drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we think it's because probably the
mice produce more glutathione,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they prevent the activity of the drug
to get to the leukemic cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you combine with mTOR inhibitors,
you can potentiate the activity of DMAPT
[SPEAKER_05]: in people to kill leukemia in mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also showed you it works in dogs without
any other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, again, the biology of each
species is going to be very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what was very cool about the
nanoparticles is because they are very
[SPEAKER_05]: slow release, we can deliver them once
every two weeks via tail pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, we loaded as much as we can load
of parthenolide into that mice cell,
[SPEAKER_05]: which will represent approximately,
assuming that all the parthenolide made it
[SPEAKER_05]: in the animal, will be 2.5 milligrams per
kilogram per mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see it's a huge difference in
dosing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we found is that in the
nanoparticle, parthenolide was very potent
[SPEAKER_05]: at eliminating total tumor burden when
compared with the mice cells with
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide or with the empty
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also found that it was very potently
inhibiting NF-kB in people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing that I found really
interesting is when we measured
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide either in the plasma or in
the bones of these mice one hour after
[SPEAKER_05]: bolus treatment with these nanoparticles,
we found that there was nothing in the
[SPEAKER_05]: plasma, and everything was in the bones,
just in one hour after injecting these
[SPEAKER_05]: nanoparticles, suggesting that these
nanoparticles were very effective at
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing parthenolide to the bones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also did a serial transplantation to
demonstrate that we're actually still
[SPEAKER_05]: killing leukemias stem cells and we saw
these are two PDX, meaning two primary AML
[SPEAKER_05]: samples injected into the mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We showed that in serial transplantation,
we decrease the ability of leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells to give rise to disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because all of these parts,
because of the great activity of
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide, because we find it from
natural products, we thought that it would
[SPEAKER_05]: be very important to start a collaboration
with people that know about plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: that know about chemical structures,
they know about squintropin lactones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started a collaboration with the New
York Botanical Gardens with Cornell here
[SPEAKER_05]: with Dr. Eloy Rodriguez and with the
University of Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this collaboration consists in finding
plants that are related to fever fuel to
[SPEAKER_05]: find better squintropin lactones that will
have similar activity to parthenolide that
[SPEAKER_05]: we can take to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully in a rapid manner and understand
better what are the critical activities of
[SPEAKER_05]: this type of compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope we can have more updates soon,
but this project is advancing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to switch gears after we talked
all about squintropin lactones and
[SPEAKER_05]: parthenolide, I would like to briefly
mention the work of cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I want to talk about
cranberries is because this work started
[SPEAKER_05]: from a PhD student that came from this
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now she's a postdoc in New York,
but she did her PhD here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Lori Weistrom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she loves cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's her passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything she does, lives and things,
is cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because Dr. Rodriguez, it's true,
she brings everything with cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all learning to love
cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she came to my lab because Dr.
Rodriguez mentioned her, my name,
[SPEAKER_05]: and she wanted to test her extracts in
cancers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to be her mentor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had cranberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had leukemic cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we said, let's try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a perfect combination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cranberries, as you all know,
they are well known because they are used
[SPEAKER_05]: for urinary tract infections and also can
stimulate the immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did first is try total
cranberry extracts in different leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: cell lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just an example of all the
leukemia cell lines we tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that the cranberry
extracts are very potent at causing cell
[SPEAKER_05]: death in leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a threshold, like a lower
concentration, that you can see some cells
[SPEAKER_05]: are more sensitive than other leukemic
cells around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the higher you go in the
concentration, it seems to work on other
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Laurie also purified one of the active
compounds of the cranberries, known as
[SPEAKER_05]: Apex, which are formed from different
multimers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a purified compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mixture of dimers, trimers,
tetramers, and pentamers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have also found that individual
components are not sufficient to kill the
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this mixture we use at lower
concentrations in primary samples and in
[SPEAKER_05]: the colony assays.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that at 62.5 micrograms
per milliliter, we can see that leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: progenitor cell activity is decreased.
[SPEAKER_05]: And normal activity of hematopoietic cells
is not affected.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have also done the stem cell assays we
discussed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see selectivity against leukemia
stem cells, not normal hematopoietic stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we wanted to see if she can,
because she really, really wanted to try
[SPEAKER_05]: it in vivo, so I said, well, let's try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we set up some xenografts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We transplanted primary patient samples in
a mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We established the xenograft, the animal
had leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: She treated it with PBS, side jargon,
or Apex at 25 milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_05]: two times a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: For three weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we found is that Apex were really
important at eliminating tumor cell
[SPEAKER_05]: engravment, almost at the same level as
RSC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the standard of care,
60 milligrams per kilogram, which is very
[SPEAKER_05]: toxic to the mice, as in contrast,
25 milligrams per kilogram, which it was
[SPEAKER_05]: not toxic to the animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this suggests that these cranberry
extracts could be used in vivo to kill
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia and hopefully leukemia stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: The secondary transplants are underway,
so hopefully we can also show it kills
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to summarize, what we discussed
today is that compounds derived from
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal plants, such as parthenolide and
cranberry extracts, can be used to target
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the nanoparticles represented
strategy to deliver compounds with
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacological properties into mice,
and potentially also to humans,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that other natural products are
currently being studied to target leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, what we're doing in the lab is
trying to get AML samples, characterize
[SPEAKER_05]: them well from patient to patient,
do high throughput assays to evaluate the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of compounds to kill leukemia stem
cells using functional assays,
[SPEAKER_05]: and also develop biomarkers so we can
match a drug with a patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, from the bedside to the bench,
when we start the clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_05]: we like to save samples, characterize them
well, bank bone marrow, peripheral blood,
[SPEAKER_05]: plasma, so we can do biological assays to
determine if we're targeting leukemia stem
[SPEAKER_05]: cells in the patients, and also test the
biomarkers to make sure that the drug is
[SPEAKER_05]: doing what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just finally, I need to thank the
people that have been working so hard on
[SPEAKER_05]: these projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to thank my collaborators on
the clinical side, especially Dr. Gail
[SPEAKER_05]: Robos, who is the Director of the Leukemia
Program at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Michael Balik is our collaborator at
the New York Botanical Gardens,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's been getting us a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Baker at the University of
Rochester, he provides us also leukemia
[SPEAKER_05]: cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Crooks and Cesar Compatriot work on
the modification of compounds and the
[SPEAKER_05]: purification of the compounds from plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summer, it looks busy in the
summer, we get a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_05]: students, high schoolers, and undergrads.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the team, so this is Lori,
Sabrina, and Bernardo were the PagCram
[SPEAKER_05]: team, meaning they work with Apex and
cranberries, and they named themselves
[SPEAKER_05]: PagCram.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had their logo, which was a
little Pacman-shaped cranberry eating
[SPEAKER_05]: leukemia stem cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then is Gabby, Rachel, she's actually
a student here from Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_05]: Paola, she's from Ecuador, Maria,
and yes, let me see, one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabby, but she's not in this picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are from the weeds team, they
couldn't come up with a better name,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that means that they focus on the
plants, like Fiberfew, and all other
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal plants we're getting from the
New York Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the funding that, of course,
without funding, I would be doing nothing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you done any gene expression or
anything with the cells to see if anything
[SPEAKER_06]: besides NF kappa B is effective?
[SPEAKER_05]: With parthenolite, we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found many other parthenolite
compounds using the gene expression
[SPEAKER_05]: signature of leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the strongest signature is inhibition
of NF kappa B and activation of the active
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also done modifications of
parthenolite with biotin so we can pull
[SPEAKER_05]: down its targets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we did that, we found that
parthenolite has other targets that are
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in metabolism, and that was
reported by my previous mentor,
[SPEAKER_05]: Craig Jordan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And other people have also found that can
also affect epigenetic machinery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in general, parthenolite will bind to
any protein that will have a precysteine
[SPEAKER_05]: or any thyroid loop that is available.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is not just the NF kappa B
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use it because of that feature,
but it causes many more things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the mechanism for the
nanoparticles to move the parthenolite
[SPEAKER_02]: into the right place where it is
effective?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is labeled on the surface of the
nanoparticle with an E-selecting
[SPEAKER_05]: thioepthamer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very tiny peptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can bind E-selecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So E-selecting is expressed in the
endothelium and is found in very high
[SPEAKER_05]: amounts in the endothelium of the bone
marrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how it's guided there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really cool, but it's very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to find other ways to take
them right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the DPAMT studies in the cancer canine
model then induces differentiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in AML then, of course, differentiation
induction therapy has been remarkably
[SPEAKER_02]: ineffective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are really exciting results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering if you've tried or if
anyone has tried to look at how the DPAMT
[SPEAKER_02]: works in the canine model.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, I presume, work in the human
primaries yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would be very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the time, everything happened so
fast, like really so fast that the amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of cells we had, it was not a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, thinking back, yes,
we even discussed this at some point with
[SPEAKER_05]: Craig.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice if we had cells left over
to see what happened to the cells,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is the signature in the dog cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: But first of all, we had no experience
with dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know anything about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just working with these three
animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was talking to Christy yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great opportunity to work
with dogs and try to understand more about
[SPEAKER_05]: the biology of these compounds in a system
where hopefully will be more similar to
[SPEAKER_05]: humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, maybe at least closer than mice
and xenografts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an AHR ligand?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be interesting to know if it can
potentiate, say, retinoic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, because we saw this
effect in dogs, not in mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even in the mice, when we combine with
the end-to-end hematogen, we saw very
[SPEAKER_05]: significant synergy in the mice,
in the xenografts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never saw differentiation of cells in
mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the system brown is also important to
consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never went back to those studies in
dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that different patients
have a different subset of phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that change with treatment of
phenolide?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a very good question for any
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of the efforts to try to evaluate
minimal residual disease involves flow
[SPEAKER_05]: cytometry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about tracking a
population, we need to know how this
[SPEAKER_05]: population behaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we cannot assume that the markers are
not going to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: My personal point of view, I like to see
the phenotypic markers as your dress,
[SPEAKER_05]: as your coat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You decide to wear something today,
maybe because your gene expression told
[SPEAKER_05]: you to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't mean that after you get
exposed to some very aggressive
[SPEAKER_05]: chemotherapy and you want to hide from
this therapy, maybe your dress is also
[SPEAKER_05]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something we want to understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have very strong efforts following
and understanding minimal residual disease
[SPEAKER_05]: after any chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because probably it's going to be
different from patient to patient and from
[SPEAKER_05]: therapy to therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we can tell what is abnormal,
then it would be a way to track those
[SPEAKER_05]: cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: My comment on sesquiterpe lactones,
in a review that I did quite a while back,
[SPEAKER_04]: there were almost 2,000 of them known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite diverse, primarily in the
esteraceae, the sunflower family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with one of them, they just gave a
no-go prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: The point being that these lactones,
we really don't understand how they go
[SPEAKER_04]: about it, but there are certain
boricophores on the molecule that we think
[SPEAKER_04]: attach to proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're still very far from really
understanding mechanistic action on this
[SPEAKER_04]: compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're open to an incredible
diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like what you've done, because this
is what we have to do with any kind of any
[SPEAKER_04]: natural product that we're trying to push
and utilize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a pharmaceutical, we need really
good, rigorous assays, which unfortunately
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't do with a lot of natural
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where the negative
feeling is toward natural products and
[SPEAKER_04]: potential pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the goal of the big
collaboration with all this
[SPEAKER_05]: multidisciplinary team we set together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because also, I mean, I didn't mention it,
but when I was supposed to, I tried many
[SPEAKER_05]: different sesquiterpe lactones just
because we said, oh, let's try anything
[SPEAKER_05]: that we saw that looked like parthenolide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of the activities were very
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were screening the medicinal
analogs, they all behave differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea is to try to find the most
potent sesquiterpe lactones that are still
[SPEAKER_05]: selective and try to understand where the
selectivity comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because probably the target is not going
to be the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we will be able to tell,
OK, she has to be NFKPB.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the right combination of the
sesquiterpe lactones?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cesar, my collaborator, you know Cesar,
he likes to see it as a melody.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says it's like playing the piano.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to hit the right keys in order to
produce music.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to find what that music is
for sesquiterpe lactones and leukemia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does variability in the phenotypic markers
in untreated disease reflect multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: paths for development of the disease or
differences among individuals?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the more we are doing
sequencing and trying to match sequencing
[SPEAKER_05]: to each individual patient, we might be
able to understand a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I mean, I didn't want to mention
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to make everything so more
complicated, because you are all going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get out very depressed after all of this
information, is that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even within the heterogeneity I told you,
in the tumor, there is still clone of
[SPEAKER_05]: heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning, within the same patient,
you're going to have several clones with
[SPEAKER_05]: different mutations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I think about targeting leukemia
and leukemia stem cells, we're playing the
[SPEAKER_05]: game whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hit one, and the other one comes out
of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just try to find a huge hammer to
get them all down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And probably, it's also that heterogeneity
that you have in the genotype that will be
[SPEAKER_05]: reflected in the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because all of this is evolving so
rapidly, maybe we'll very soon have enough
[SPEAKER_05]: information to match the third surface
signature with some genetic signature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will help us distinguish them one
from the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any possibility that when you do
the serial transplants, that because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is so rapidly evolving,
that a leukemia cell that's not a stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell can gain more stem cell-like
properties and be a founder for the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, even though it wasn't originally
a leukemia stem cell where it was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that not something that really
happens?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a hypothesis that people have
thought, but not only in the mouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: also in people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what, when I told you about the
origin of leukemia, is that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what is the directionality
of the cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the definition of a leukemia stem cell
does not mean it's a cell that came from a
[SPEAKER_05]: normal stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cell that acquired the ability to
behave like a stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could have been a more mature,
it could have been a blast, but the right
[SPEAKER_05]: combination of genetic modifications or
epigenetic modification gave them the
[SPEAKER_05]: capacity to self-renew and give rise to
progeny.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, and actually there are studies
that have shown the more aggressive the
[SPEAKER_05]: tumor becomes, even in patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you take a patient, a diagnosis,
and separate C34 positive, C38 negative
[SPEAKER_05]: cells, you can see the hierarchy,
as I described to you, works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stem cells are the stem cells,
and then you have the progeny,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take sample from a relapse patient,
the same patient at relapse, and take the
[SPEAKER_05]: different C34 positive, C38 negative,
and then other cells, every cell will
[SPEAKER_05]: behave like a stem cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hierarchy is not maintained in that
case, meaning that chemotherapy must have
[SPEAKER_05]: changed something in the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we think we need to really
catch and kill the cells from the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning, or when they are quiescent
before they come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they come back, they're a different
monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll allow it.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of questions, and somebody
has a real important one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
