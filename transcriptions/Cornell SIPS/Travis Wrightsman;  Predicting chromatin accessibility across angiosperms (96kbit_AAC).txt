[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really interested in how we can
aid breeding efforts across a wide range
[SPEAKER_01]: of crop species in order to combat
malnutrition and really aid the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a wider variety of food sources in our
diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one way that we can think of how to
aid these breeding efforts is by
[SPEAKER_01]: transferring knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question is, how can we
transfer lessons learned from well-studied
[SPEAKER_01]: species like maize and Arabidopsis and
apply that knowledge to a wide number of
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and orphan crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the mechanisms that we can
use to facilitate this transfer of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge is by thinking of mechanisms
that are conserved across long
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary time scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the mechanisms that's
conserved across long evolutionary time
[SPEAKER_01]: scales is transcription factor binding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm showing here is a very
simplistic tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want you to take away from it
is in the red is what I'm showing the
[SPEAKER_01]: emergence of new transcription factor
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are a number of transcription
factor families that predate the origin of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there are a number of plant
specific transcription factor families
[SPEAKER_01]: that predate angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we expect a lot of their binding
motifs to be conserved in many of these
[SPEAKER_01]: plant species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the problem that a former
member of the lab, Catherine Mejiaquera,
[SPEAKER_01]: explicitly tried to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what she did was she trained some
sequence models on to predict whether a TF
[SPEAKER_01]: is bound to a specific DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she looks at the motifs that are
learned by these models and clusters them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they follow the expected phylogeny of the
transcription factor families that she
[SPEAKER_01]: sampled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests that the models are
really learning the biologically relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: motifs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what she did then was compare the
learned motifs against the orthologs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis and saw that about 60% of
these binding motifs are conserved between
[SPEAKER_01]: the two species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I wanted to do to follow up on
this was take Catherine's model
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture and train them in Arabidopsis
specific TF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I used, I predicted in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I want you to focus on here is
the area, the relative area under these
[SPEAKER_01]: curves here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the black line shows the within
species model performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I take that same model and
attempt to predict an orthologous TF and
[SPEAKER_01]: maze, I get a reduction in performance,
but still above the baseline random
[SPEAKER_01]: classifier shown in the gray dash line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next, when I take Arabidopsis and maze
sequence and attempt to predict TF binding
[SPEAKER_01]: in Arabidopsis or maze, I see that this
across species model does almost as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as the within species model, despite very
different genomic context between these
[SPEAKER_01]: two species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unfortunately, transcription factor
binding, especially ChIP-seq is expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: and complicated to assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was wondering if there was an
alternative way that we can really get at
[SPEAKER_01]: this transcription factor binding motif
question in a more easily accessible
[SPEAKER_01]: manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that open chromatin regions
in the genome are really where these
[SPEAKER_01]: functional transcription factor binding
motifs are concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here I'm just showing a very simple
schematic of an open chromatin region
[SPEAKER_01]: flanked by the closed chromatin wrapped
around the histones and various
[SPEAKER_01]: transcription factors bound in different
orientations in the sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question becomes, can we
transfer these open chromatin sequences
[SPEAKER_01]: across angiosperms, but also are they even
relevant for breeding purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the questions that this
2016 study in maze attempted to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they found is that open
chromatin regions explain about 40% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic variants in a number of traits
in two maze populations, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_01]: really these open chromatin regions do
help capture some of the non-genic
[SPEAKER_01]: functional space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next question becomes,
can we, well, so I've shown that maze and
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis, you can transfer
transcription factor binding between the
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then can we also transfer chromatin
accessibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next question becomes,
what kind of model would be used to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the models that I've already
introduced in a previous seminar is
[SPEAKER_01]: convolutional neural networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so CNNs are really well suited for
this kind of open chromatin prediction
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're designed to learn the
spatial dependencies and relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: between motifs or patterns in a sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly like we expect the
transcription factor binding motifs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: arranged in the open chromatin like I
showed in the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another important point here is
that not only do these CNNs learn the
[SPEAKER_01]: presence and absence relationship between
TFs and chromatin accessibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more importantly, the co-presence and
the co-presence of maybe larger TF
[SPEAKER_01]: modules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because since TF binding sites are so
short and degenerate, they tend to occur
[SPEAKER_01]: just by chance throughout the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really critical that we can
precisely identify these open chromatin
[SPEAKER_01]: regions by their context and not just
single motifs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how I trained this convolutional
neural network was using an excellent LEAF
[SPEAKER_01]: ATAC-seq data set from 13 angiosperms
species that was published last year by
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Schmidt's group over at the University
of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I did was I trained this CNN
in 26 different configurations,
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 of which were within species model,
where I took one species, split the
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic regions into training and test
sets, and then evaluated the model in the
[SPEAKER_01]: test set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also trained 13 across species
models where I took one test species of
[SPEAKER_01]: the angiosperms, trained in the genomic
regions of the other 12, and tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict chromatin accessibility in the
13th species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a very quick overview of how the
data looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ATAC-seq causes basically a read
pileup in these open chromatin regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can run an algorithm that's known
as a peak caller to binarize that output
[SPEAKER_01]: and denoise the open chromatin.
[SPEAKER_01]: region predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you can do is then randomly
sample a group of closed chromatin regions
[SPEAKER_01]: from the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very quickly, an example for a specific
sequence or specific species, let's say a
[SPEAKER_01]: rabidopsis, the within species model,
very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just split the genomic regions and
train in the training set and then test in
[SPEAKER_01]: your test set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the across species model,
let's say we're testing in a rabidopsis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would then train in the other 12
species and attempt to predict in a
[SPEAKER_01]: rabidopsis like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here is what the example
performance would look like for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rabidopsis within species and across
species model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the performances on the x-axis from
0 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I do the results across all
the angiosperm species I've sampled,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see that despite there being a
variability in performance across the
[SPEAKER_01]: species, they're all doing much,
much better than a random baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: classifier shown in the gray dash or the
black dash line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we show the across species
model performance, pretty much in every
[SPEAKER_01]: species, we see that the across species
model performance is very equivalent to
[SPEAKER_01]: the within species model performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this suggests is that without
seeing any open chromatin data from a
[SPEAKER_01]: given species, we're still able to utilize
angiosperm open chromatin data to
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately and precisely predict the open
chromatin in that unobserved species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to dive a little deeper into these
results, I want to show you two precision
[SPEAKER_01]: recall plots from my across species
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left, we see a rabidopsis dolly
on as the test set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want you to take away from this
is that essentially about 55% of my open
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatin regions in a rabidopsis,
the model is able to precisely predict
[SPEAKER_01]: them before it starts to begin making
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so also in asparagus, which the model
does relatively worse on, we're still able
[SPEAKER_01]: to predict about 20% of the open chromatin
regions as open precisely before we start
[SPEAKER_01]: to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this suggests is that there
seems to be a subset of open chromatin
[SPEAKER_01]: regions that we're really precisely able
to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these might be a good starting point
while we're still trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_01]: to predict the other percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other interesting phenomenon that
we see in asparagus and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: species is this rapid drop-off in
precision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, what this says is there is
a subset of closed chromatin regions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ATAC-seq that the model is highly
confidently predicting as open,
[SPEAKER_01]: which suggests to me there may be some
maybe due to lower coverage in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ATAC-seq some truly open regions that were
marked as closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really gets at the whole idea
that your model can only be evaluated as
[SPEAKER_01]: good as your test set is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in summary, shown a bit that
transcription factor binding can be
[SPEAKER_01]: predicted across angiosperms, but is
unfortunately expensive and complicated to
[SPEAKER_01]: assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the open chromatin also contains
transcription factor binding sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore overlap our non-genic
functional sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore, CNNs can predict,
I show that CNNs can predict chromatin
[SPEAKER_01]: accessibility across long evolutionary
distances with high accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple more things I want to follow
up on is how well do these leaf-train
[SPEAKER_01]: models do in other tissues, as well as are
these predicted regions enriched in GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: hits and other signals of rigidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd like to finally acknowledge my
committee, Ed Buckler, Amy Wheeler,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Eric Richards for their guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catherine Mejia-Guera, who has been an
unofficial fourth committee member and has
[SPEAKER_01]: really been who I'm basing a lot of this
work on off of, as well as the Buckler Lab
[SPEAKER_01]: for their excellent discussions on this
project, and of course, my funding
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for that talk,
Travis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of clap emojis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has any questions, they can
either add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think Mike Gore has some questions,
if you can see them in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a need to control for
evolutionary relatedness when predicting
[SPEAKER_01]: across species, or is that what is
leveraged?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about this in the lab a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really leaning towards the second
part of that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evolutionary relationship between
these open chromatin regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a tough call, because
that's exactly what we're trying to expect
[SPEAKER_01]: to leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question becomes, how can we make
sure these models are learning,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, transcription factor binding
rather than non-informative but
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary related sequence?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, are the shared open
chromatin regions overlapping with
[SPEAKER_01]: conserved non-coding regions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked at this yet, but that's a
question I definitely want to follow up
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis, just to follow on what Mike was
asking, have you tried schemes where if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're predicting a monocot, you just use
the monocots, you don't bother with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dicots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does that impact performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's an interesting question,
because I did do that initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't shown the results here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does show essentially what you
expect in that for most of the species,
[SPEAKER_01]: performance decreases a bit slightly when
you go from a monocot-based model to an
[SPEAKER_01]: angiosperm-based model.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some very strange signal for some
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we saw Poplar was very good with the
dicot model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you bring it out to the
angiosperms, it does poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say generally, performance lowers a
little bit, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to explain the lower performance in
maize compared to rice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I'll answer that question by
just sort of explaining why I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some variability between species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ed sort of gets at that point a bit in
that there is an uneven depth of data
[SPEAKER_01]: between these species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only is the data quality a bit
variable between species, and we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: that by looking at the within species
models are also performing poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a combination of uneven data quality
across the species, maybe some assembly
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, some possible tissue mismatching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a number of things that could
go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wraps up our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can give a final round of applause
to all of our speakers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to fill out that feedback form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tune back in Friday at 2 30 for four
more great talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
