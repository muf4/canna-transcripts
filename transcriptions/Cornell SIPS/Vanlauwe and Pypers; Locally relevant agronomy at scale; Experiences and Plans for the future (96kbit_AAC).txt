[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernard will lead us off and Peter will
take over about halfway through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So without any further ado, thank you very
much both for joining us today and Bernard
[SPEAKER_07]: the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah thanks a lot Andy and also thanks for
the invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember we had planned this I think
earlier this year when we said let's still
[SPEAKER_03]: meet in you know face to face in the US by
that time you know we'll know that the
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID situation will have been resolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember that discussion?
[SPEAKER_03]: It would actually have been nice to come
physically to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have a bit of cooperation with
Cornell some years ago but it's been some
[SPEAKER_03]: time now that I've been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's maybe book this this next year again
sometime and thanks also for allowing us
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about the new initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've developed the slides with my
colleague.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk a little bit about the
broad picture of what we call excellence
[SPEAKER_03]: in agronomy and then Peter will give a
little bit more zooming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will zoom in on an initiative that has
basically probably created some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: arguments why we need an excellence in
agronomy initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rationale why why why why agronomy
why you know agronomy is not a new term
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a new research area so why do we
need an initiative across the CGR on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of arguments we usually
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know there's been quite a bit of
success with crop improvement if you read
[SPEAKER_03]: publications about the CGR and impact
that's usually around that but we also
[SPEAKER_03]: know that the expression of what is called
genetic gain at scale is not always there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some recent work from Siemens who
looked at maize modern they call it modern
[SPEAKER_03]: variety adoption against national brain
yields for a lot of countries in Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see very nicely the picture is quite
scattered although in a lot of countries
[SPEAKER_03]: there is quite a bit of an uptake of
modern maize varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you also see countries like
Ethiopia where there's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: substantial increases in yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know why that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that variety alone is not
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that you need your nutrient
inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other side of the coin also shows this
is for instance FAO data on the left side
[SPEAKER_03]: here showing fertilizer use over time for
Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a clear increase in Malawi and
Zambia.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are maize yields for the same period
and you can correlate those data and you
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly see that there is a nice
relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course not all that fertilizer is
applied to that maize that's for sure but
[SPEAKER_03]: there is definitely a large proportion of
it is in southern Africa which is all
[SPEAKER_03]: maize based basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we know that but it's good also to
see it confirmed in data.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second argument and I will not dwell
on this one the science advancement.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of development in
tools, methods, geospatial statistics,
[SPEAKER_03]: big data analytics that actually allows us
to implement agronomical economy to scale
[SPEAKER_03]: R &D while still being locally relevant
and I'm not going to dwell on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter will dig a lot deeper into this
bullet later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third bullet why we feel there is need
there is a large demand for agronomy at
[SPEAKER_03]: scale with a lot of public and private
partner sectors which is new.
[SPEAKER_03]: By new I mean it's not new as such but 20
years ago this was not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while 20 years ago you could have done
excellent science that demand and interest
[SPEAKER_03]: was not there today it isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we know the CTA reports from last
year conducted by Dahlberg which shows the
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of D4AC company startups present in
Africa with Kenya here on the left having
[SPEAKER_03]: at least 150 initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also see on the map here that although
the number of initiatives in blue is
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty similar between East and West
Africa the users in East Africa the orange
[SPEAKER_03]: circle is much larger than in West Africa
although probably today those circles have
[SPEAKER_03]: changed already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of all those companies the insurance
companies, agronomy advisory they are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in agronomy at scale solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the very last point the CGR reform
process I think Andy alluded to there is a
[SPEAKER_03]: reform process ongoing and it gives us an
opportunity to organize agronomical R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2005 there's not been a unifying
force in the agronomy space in the CGIAR.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the centers here I'm not sure
how familiar everyone is with the centers
[SPEAKER_03]: but we are working with 10 centers which
are highlighted here and we currently
[SPEAKER_03]: still have about 130 agronomists involved
in quite a lot of initiatives and spending
[SPEAKER_03]: about 10 to 15 percent of the budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still impressive when we did this
study we were a little bit surprised but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's mainly through time bound projects
which come and go which don't create a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of incentives to cross learn to share
experiences so we want to change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what is the purpose and the scope?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean this is this is a lot of you know
big words and difficult words so I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to read this but basically what we
want to do is we want to deliver agronomic
[SPEAKER_03]: gain for a lot of people because we know
that agronomic gain will have a positive
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on livelihoods, income,
soil health, climate resilience and we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do this by setting up agronomy at
scale solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two words in blue I will dwell on a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is agronomy at scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had that question a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what we really want to do is we want
to resolve that conundrum that
[SPEAKER_03]: contradiction that agronomy has been
plagued with.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the one hand agronomy is locally
relevant, it's place-based, it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: adaptive process but at the same time we
need to work with millions of people on
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of hectares.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you resolve this?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years ago it was not resolvable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way you can resolve this 20 years
ago is you go to a new village and you
[SPEAKER_03]: start all over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we can resolve that conundrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we want to do in agronomy at scale
is we want to assist people, farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: decision makers to take the right
decisions on those soil and crop
[SPEAKER_03]: management practices that are taking place
once a season I would say for annual
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want those crop and soil management
decisions to be influenced, informed by
[SPEAKER_03]: spatial and temporal variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want that advisory to be targeted to
end users needs and to account for yield
[SPEAKER_03]: profitability, sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter will explain what this means in
practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing I've mentioned is
agronomic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are currently developing a conceptual
framework around agronomic gain in line
[SPEAKER_03]: with what is called genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are working around four key
performance indicators, increased yields
[SPEAKER_03]: and profitability, improved resource use
efficiencies could be nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: labor, increased yield stability and
improved soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course we know that those KPIs will
vary in importance or relative importance
[SPEAKER_03]: for the various regions of the global
south.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we going to deliver that agronomy
at scale and develop solutions and deliver
[SPEAKER_03]: them with partners?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a co-creation process with all
those centers and the assistant does with
[SPEAKER_03]: this and a number of other external
partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ended up with a structure around
four what we call modules.
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds a bit, you know, a little bit
theoretical and so on, but I still want to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain this because it shows a little bit
different ways in which we want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left side, we have the organize
module, which is really hosting the
[SPEAKER_03]: functions related to internal
organizations partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also where we do the
prioritization and demand mapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these are two key words for the
ones, the new excellence in agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initiative prioritization.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means having a objective,
verifiable framework to decide where and
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're going to do and demand
mapping, which means we are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely respond to demand by real
people working with real farmers and in
[SPEAKER_03]: the real regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will happen here based on that
demand mapping and prioritization process.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a number of projects,
one, two to N, which will start and stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And which will deliver solutions at scale
depending on the demand that was
[SPEAKER_03]: formulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this projects will be counting on and
using tools and data and analytics in the
[SPEAKER_03]: transform module, which is this vertical
box here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where we feel there is not enough data
or analytics available to immediately use
[SPEAKER_03]: in the delivery of those products will go
into the innovate module, which is where
[SPEAKER_03]: the innovative, the new R&D will be done
in support of agronomy at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, these two central core
boxes are influenced by new data collected
[SPEAKER_03]: through these projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: This slide is interesting also because it
shows the docking points for partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we talk to you colleagues in Cornell,
we at the CGR, we will not claim and we
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot claim that we host all the skills
and capacity needed to deliver an agronomy
[SPEAKER_03]: at scale program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have a docking point for
international research and academics
[SPEAKER_03]: through the innovate module.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably at one time next year,
we will start actually talking to Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: and then see what this means in practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a docking point for the national
system scientists to the transform module
[SPEAKER_03]: because we want those tools to be
accessible, used and empowering national
[SPEAKER_03]: systems to use those tools and data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our demand partners here,
the country engagement, the private
[SPEAKER_03]: sector, all the people who need our
agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a docking point for a donor
interest group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this slide is really in one slide
summarizing a lot of the logic and
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships that we want to set up to
deliver on our vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few more slides to dig a little bit
deeper into those modules in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: organized module.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, one of the key innovations that
we want to apply in agronomy is have a
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very conscientious process on
prioritization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked in agronomy myself for,
I usually say more than 10 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: although it's almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes if you look back,
you see that a lot of projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: you go, you do your work, your
demonstrations, but you don't decide or
[SPEAKER_03]: you've not reflected well on why you do
certain activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is the enabling environment
sufficient?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the potential for scaling really there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to be absolutely objective and
explicit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are developing a three-stage process
where we start to define where the
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomy can make a difference in terms of
farming systems, countries, and the status
[SPEAKER_03]: of our key performance indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within that, do the demand mapping and
look at the conditions for uptake of
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomy at scale, and then have an
ex-ante assessment framework on potential
[SPEAKER_03]: solutions on our technology packages that
we would like to deploy in the respond to
[SPEAKER_03]: that demand within a certain geography.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of discussion going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is work in progress, but I wanted to
highlight this as a key innovation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: way we want to organize our agronomy
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: The transform module, Peter will talk much
more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, as I said, the core.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the data and the data
solutions on the left are and where the
[SPEAKER_03]: analytics and turnkey models on the right
side are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one example, we are going to work
quite a bit with the big data platform of
[SPEAKER_03]: the OneCGR.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is recent work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've looked at their Guardian
database, assembled fertilizer response
[SPEAKER_03]: data from 760 locations, used machine
learning procedures on those data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obtained price data and computed
profitability in space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on that, could map the
profitability of fertilizer within the
[SPEAKER_03]: continent with not only profitability on
average, but also error bars around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this shows the power of big
data, the power of what you can do if you
[SPEAKER_03]: are better organized and assembling more
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the tools, the turnkey
solutions, Peter will talk a lot about our
[SPEAKER_03]: African cassava agronomy initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've shown this slide quite a few times,
so now I can also explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Peter will even do a better
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will hand the explanation of this
slide over to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of innovate, this is,
I think, where we absolutely need to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to Cornell and other colleagues in the US
and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we want to do new arrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just one example on where we want
to engage in measuring yield at scale
[SPEAKER_03]: within season to increase the efficiency
of our agronomy workflows and so on and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will be a lot of other
opportunities to advance the science of
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last module, the deliver module,
we have actually phrased around the number
[SPEAKER_03]: of key steps around the generic workflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took quite a bit of time to develop
this workflow, but it's also based on a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of learning and probably a lot of
earlier mistake making.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left side, number one,
agree on the core partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we place the demand for
agronomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And number two, step number two,
under that develops the tool, the minimum
[SPEAKER_03]: viable product.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that decision tool that we are
going to develop?
[SPEAKER_03]: In response to that demand, I will not go
into detail with a lot of the other step,
[SPEAKER_03]: but once you have that MVP described very
well, we need to go in assembling the data
[SPEAKER_03]: and the tools, go into prototyping and
very important step five, go into the
[SPEAKER_03]: validation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we've learned by experience that
the validation process is not just a
[SPEAKER_03]: technical process, a set of technical
processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can test tools look at the
recommendations, implement them and look
[SPEAKER_03]: at yield differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we would do as agronomists.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've learned from experience that the
user experience, the way recommendations
[SPEAKER_03]: are formulated and made accessible to
people, the way they are interpreted is as
[SPEAKER_03]: important as the technical content itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've learned by doing that,
being the month driven with agronomy at
[SPEAKER_03]: scale, you have to have almost equal
importance given to the technical aspects
[SPEAKER_03]: as to the user experience aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course you go into scaling and
so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in our current work, we are currently
operating a two year incubation phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have identified 10 of what we call use
cases that are now under implementation
[SPEAKER_03]: and which are all based on actual demand
from a specific demand partner on a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific agronomic issue in a specific
geography.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have six of them in Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two of them in Asia, one in Egypt,
North Africa and one in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each of them has a partner,
an agronomy need, a grouping system and a
[SPEAKER_03]: geography in which this will be applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I will not have time to go
into all this, but maybe to dig a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit deeper into one example, the example
of digital green in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital green is an NGO, probably some of
you know them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are planning to reach 25,000 farmers
in wheat production system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are interested in how they can
increase wheat yields and quality of
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not just yield, but also the quality of
the consistency, the nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want advisory on wheat dress
surveillance, planting data advisory and
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a platform in which they
provide information to farmers via voice
[SPEAKER_03]: recognition or SMS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually have an online platform
to collect feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've set up a partnership with digital
green, the national systems, ministry of
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, and then some call support
from USAID and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this use case, which is that tool that
will be submitted through IVR of SMS
[SPEAKER_03]: information on these particular topics
will then be piloted and validated and
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately developed in a form ready for
scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just one example, but we do
have 10 of those examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my last slide from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter will take over.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, my job was to sketch in broad
lines what excellence in agronomy is
[SPEAKER_03]: about, what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, inviting Cornell to join
us, help us.
[SPEAKER_03]: With some effort, and I've also tried to
probably show that a lot of the tools are
[SPEAKER_03]: working in progress or under development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will need support to develop,
to finish their development.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will stop sharing and I assume Peter
will take over now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over to Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot Bernard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see your screen, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks everyone for also giving me the
chance to present some of the work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Bernard gave already quite a
number of hints, I'll try and dig a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit deeper into some of the work that's
been happening through the African Cassava
[SPEAKER_04]: Agronomy Initiative, or ACAI, and give
some meat to the bone of some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: concepts that Bernard has just spoken
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a means of introduction,
I just like to show a typical African
[SPEAKER_04]: farming landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from North Tanzania, where you
typically see lots of small holders
[SPEAKER_04]: dispersed in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's slopes, there's different crops,
there's a lot of banana here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different plots, erosion happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see some good plots, some bad plots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark green crops and very pale yellow
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very typical situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And providing advice that's relevant to
smallholders, you need to take into
[SPEAKER_04]: account that sort of heterogeneity that
you'll find.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever you're going to promote is
definitely not going to work in each and
[SPEAKER_04]: every farm and each and every plot of
every farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you zoom out and if you look at
Africa, from high up in the sky,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's also a lot of variation at that
scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you see actually East Africa,
you see on top there you see Lake
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria, and on the right you see Mount
Kilimanjaro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at that scale, you have to
deal with a lot of different soils from
[SPEAKER_04]: very acid to actually high pH soils in
this area even.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also that sort of heterogeneity needs
to be taken into account.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually that's often easier to do because
we have digital soil maps.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just showing you soil pH values
from soil grids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a bit later more about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this digital soil information,
we can use that when we provide economic
[SPEAKER_04]: advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, if we want to advise
farmers over the past decades,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've seen numerous papers that talk about
there is need for local adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Integrated soil fertility management
requires adapting your recommendations
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on the type of the sort of field
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you see soil fertility varying
as much within a single farm as across the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire continent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So blanket recommendations won't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll never be a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that brings me to agronomy at scale and
what it means to be locally relevant as
[SPEAKER_04]: the title said, but still working at scale
to service farmers across the landscapes
[SPEAKER_04]: and the heterogeneity that I've just
shown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does that approach mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did in the project, and I'll just
introduce the project in the next few
[SPEAKER_04]: slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we try and do is we do field
experiments, we're agronomists,
[SPEAKER_04]: we like trials and we try and understand
what sort of interventions work under what
[SPEAKER_04]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we apply crop models to predict what
will happen in sort of the next farmer's
[SPEAKER_04]: field and GIS and geospatial statistics to
extrapolate that, then pour that into some
[SPEAKER_04]: form of decision support tool that we can
put in the hands of a farmer and promote
[SPEAKER_04]: and scale that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In very simple terms, that's what the
project tries to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll try and show a little bit in more
detail how that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the agronomy flow happened in the
project, but first before that,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are a couple of sort of things that
we talked about advances in the field of
[SPEAKER_04]: agronomy and some of the tools that became
available and that we're sort of applying
[SPEAKER_04]: in this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about using GIS to assist us
with sampling locations, but also
[SPEAKER_04]: extrapolating our results.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing field trials with very
effective experimental designs and using
[SPEAKER_04]: actually efficient data management systems
within those to make sure that any data we
[SPEAKER_04]: collect, we can actually use within 24
hours after collecting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a lot of stats and geospatial work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use not just trials, but also surveys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes measuring things in farmer's
fields can actually get you answers much
[SPEAKER_04]: faster than doing trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use a lot of methods that are fast and
accurate, but sometimes less precise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes spectral methods in the field to
look at nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also with soil sample, so when we analyze
those and we have large numbers of samples
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than throwing these into a webcam
lab, we try and measure those very quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: using near infrared, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crop modeling, I'll talk quite a bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And software and decision support tool
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the African Cassava Agronomy
Initiative, this is its logo, is one of a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of sister projects that have worked
on this agronomy at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this project is now
specifically on Cassava.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try to develop new technologies,
tailor these to the heterogeneity of
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers and deliver recommendations to
120,000 farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our goal, and we set out in 2016
when we started this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: We operate in Nigeria and Tanzania,
and we work with many, many farmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: many, many partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a bit more about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, the core thing that we
really wanted to achieve is really having
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence-based recommendations that are as
much as possible tailored to be as locally
[SPEAKER_04]: relevant as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today, some numbers, we've involved
over 20,000 farmers in field
[SPEAKER_04]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've run over 5,000 on-farm field trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are researcher-managed trials,
but conducted on-farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've taken over 50,000 cassava yield
measurements in those farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than 90% of all the data we've
generated comes from farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done actually very little
on-station work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work on six use cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are sort of demands that were
formulated within the project by the
[SPEAKER_04]: primary partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: These partners are people that are on
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are NGOs, they are fertilizer
companies, they are starch processing
[SPEAKER_04]: factories, who actually formulated what
they need in terms of agronomy advice to
[SPEAKER_04]: serve their clients, their farmers that
they're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, for example, fertilizer
companies who ask for better blends,
[SPEAKER_04]: formulating better blends, NGOs who work
on intercropping practices or planting
[SPEAKER_04]: practices, including tillage and weed
control.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have starch factories who want advice
on when to plant and harvest so that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can get year-round supply of roots to
their factories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And several partners actually are
interested in fertilizer use to increase
[SPEAKER_04]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'll talk a little bit more about
the fertilizer work as an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much of the approaches I'll show,
we've also applied to the other use cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one is a bit special and I think
a very good example of how we work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started off, like I said,
we're agronomists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to do trials and we did many of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started with nutrient emission
trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very simple trials where we applied high
rates of nitrogen, phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium and then looked at what happened
if we omitted any of those elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a typical example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, you get high yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you apply the nutrients, you take those
nutrients away, the yield drops
[SPEAKER_04]: substantially.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't see the same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just an example from our first
season in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see that in some farmers' fields,
omitting nitrogen reduces the yield a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other plots of farmers, it's not so
much the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we've done many,
many of those trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done about, I think, close to a
thousand of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have over close to 5,000 plot yield
measurements.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that data sort of served us to start
doing some modeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually coupled two models.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used Lintool and more recently,
actually, we switched to DSAT together to
[SPEAKER_04]: give us water-limited yields using
geospatial weather data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used soil data, also geospatial
soil data and fed that to crefts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we, let's say, dismantled crefts a bit
and replaced some of the parts by machine
[SPEAKER_04]: learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: To predict indigenous nutrient supply from
the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also combined that with some variables
that we got from the farmer himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we use soil grids.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is again pH, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil grids actually offers digital soil
information on most of the traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: soil parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what you typically see is this is
more recent data.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is yield with fertilizer versus a
control yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see this sort of typical spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have typically with higher yields,
more variation, but also larger responses
[SPEAKER_04]: until you reach, of course, very high
yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you don't see yield decreasing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what you see is actually that the
current yield is often the best single
[SPEAKER_04]: indicator for the expected response.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see the yield is low, typically you
also expect that the fertilizer response
[SPEAKER_04]: will be low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use that information to define some
yield categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And farmers can easily identify with them
if you turn that into pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you tell them, you know, this is the
typical cassava plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, which one is the most common in
your field?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can actually easily relate to
that and say, you know, my field,
[SPEAKER_04]: most often our plants look like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a way for us to actually
identify what kind of yield category or
[SPEAKER_04]: yield class we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of those variables that we
added to the model to predict indigenous
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, from all that data, we're also able
to see what kind of, at what level
[SPEAKER_04]: variability in nutrient response occurs
and maybe not unexpected from the pictures
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that variation happens at a very
local scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in this case, the green part of
this bar between fields from one field to
[SPEAKER_04]: another, a very small scale, but also at
the regional level, referring back to that
[SPEAKER_04]: map of East Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you see between regions at a much
larger scale, also an important level of
[SPEAKER_04]: variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if we try and predict that using soil
information from soil grids alone,
[SPEAKER_04]: we didn't do too well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are squares of 0.3 to 0.5 at most.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not able to really predict
nutrient supply and response consequently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we combine that with that sort of
local information that we got from the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer, including those yield categories,
we did substantially better and good
[SPEAKER_04]: enough actually to start predicting and
going further with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get R squares of 0.6 to 0.8,
which we were very happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the next step, of course,
is we also need the yield ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to know what water limited
yields as sort of the maximum level of
[SPEAKER_04]: yield that farmers can attain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for cassava being an annual crop,
indeterminate crop actually, farmers plant
[SPEAKER_04]: cassava almost at any point in the year in
Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will also harvest it at any point
of the year, sometimes very early after
[SPEAKER_04]: eight, nine months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they leave it in their field for
15 to 16 months.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has important implications also
for the kind of yields that farmers can
[SPEAKER_04]: get and what kind of responses to
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to take that into account, we used DSAT
and we ran over 416 million gridded runs
[SPEAKER_04]: of that model with rainfall data from the
past 25 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that gave us data like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: For one pixel, for example, depending on
when farmers plant and harvest,
[SPEAKER_04]: we could have a prediction of what the
yield would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also interestingly, some level of
confidence or variation due to rainfall,
[SPEAKER_04]: which helps us to make predictions on risk
and uncertainty on fertilizer response.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we're not done.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have yield predictions,
we have fertilizer response predictions or
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient response predictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to give advice to farmers,
we don't need to tell them how much NP and
[SPEAKER_04]: K to apply to get a certain yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to tell them how much fertilizer
to apply to get a certain net return on
[SPEAKER_04]: that investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a farmer is not necessarily interested
in getting the highest yield, but the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we coupled all this then to an economic
optimizer, which basically converts
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient responses to fertilizer responses
instead of yield to be optimized for net
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that allowed us to build maps like this
one, for example, these are two states in
[SPEAKER_04]: Nigeria and on the left, it shows a
recommendation for a urea application.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the right-hand side, the kind of
yield improvements that farmers can expect
[SPEAKER_04]: for a certain yield class this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can provide this to extension
workers and they can use that to do
[SPEAKER_04]: cost-benefit analysis, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we run this on a smartphone and I'll
talk a bit later about that, you can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually work with the GPS capability of
the smartphone to do this at a much higher
[SPEAKER_04]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks more like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the last step in that whole
process, after we've done all that work,
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to actually validate that the
recommendations we come up with are good,
[SPEAKER_04]: are profitable for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did is basically laying out
lots and lots of very simple trials,
[SPEAKER_04]: just two plots, a control and our
recommendation, just next to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: We color-coded them, blue and yellow in
this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did many of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did over 5,000 of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can look at how farmers
actually performed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that over 75% do realize a
yield and a profit improvement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And only 2% actually had a negative
impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with fertilizer, you don't expect
really much negative yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: But fertilizer costs something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just yield effect,
but it's also getting that money back from
[SPEAKER_04]: your investment in fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that made us very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is another way of looking at
these results.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are cumulative probability
distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the more the curve to the right,
the larger the proportion of farmers that
[SPEAKER_04]: had a positive return on their investment
or positive yield effect in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did that during two seasons in both
Nigeria and Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were really excited about these
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've done all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question is then, how do you put that
actually to use in the hands of a farmer?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can a farmer access that information
and actually do something with that
[SPEAKER_04]: without us needing to intervene directly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is where Akilimo comes into
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the name that we've given to
our decision support system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's turned out more of a platform now
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Akilimo is actually two Swahili words
pulled together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's akili, which means brain,
literally, or smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kilimo, which means agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So giving that whole thing actually a name
has also really helped us to sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the slide Bernard referred to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this sort of embodies what Akilimo is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a digital service to provide tailored
agronomic advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the left box, you see all that
science we've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that data and all those models,
they sit on a cloud base.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prediction engine that can run those
models with input provided through
[SPEAKER_04]: different interfaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the middle box there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we built two of those interfaces
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've built a smartphone app.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also made some simple tools that
people can print that simplify those
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations to a two-pager that people
can easily print and work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, we work with several
legit lab companies who have integrated
[SPEAKER_04]: that service into their service.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these provide the
recommendations over an interactive SMS
[SPEAKER_04]: system or through a chat bot or through an
IVR, an interactive voice response system
[SPEAKER_04]: so that farmers can actually directly
interact with our recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are examples of those two pages,
those printable leaflets that basically
[SPEAKER_04]: show in an as visual way as possible the
critical elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go hand in hand with worksheets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, two pages where farmers are
basically led through the basic
[SPEAKER_04]: calculations that need to be made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've trained extension workers to
help farmers complete those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're available all in local
languages, seven or eight local languages
[SPEAKER_04]: in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some screenshots from our app
that we've built.
[SPEAKER_04]: The app obviously gives a much higher
precision than the paper-based can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But limitation there is that many farmers
don't have smartphones and that this sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of tool is mostly used by an extension
worker who would interact with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our reach is, let's say, much more
limited than with printable tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now coming to the end, some conclusions
that we've been coming to in the last,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say, one year, maybe a bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been pushing this sort of system
through the dissemination strategies of
[SPEAKER_04]: our partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today over 82,000 users are actually
registered and applying our
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for farmers to actually profit or gain
from those recommendations, they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: be reached first.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to understand how to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to effectively use them,
do something with that information in
[SPEAKER_04]: their farm, and then realize their profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with each of those steps, we can get
some feedback of what is happening in
[SPEAKER_04]: their farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've done quite a bit of survey work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done some choice experiments,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done phone interviews and SMS
surveys, and we're getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're seeing, for example,
that use and uptake is very much affected
[SPEAKER_04]: by maybe the traditional factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Age, younger people are often more quick
to do something with this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Educated farmers typically more than
illiterate farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: As with traditional extension systems,
we often see that men have more access to
[SPEAKER_04]: these sort of tools than women.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often women don't have a phone and are
relying on their husband for getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessarily true that digital
methods are as accessible to women as to
[SPEAKER_04]: men.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wealth state is very important,
whether they are growing cassava for the
[SPEAKER_04]: market or for sustenance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dissemination methods that are being
used in the tool format, all these have an
[SPEAKER_04]: important impact on use of our tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my last slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting also, this is some very
recent work, is when we look at behavior
[SPEAKER_04]: and perceptions around our tools,
we've actually confronted farmers with 40
[SPEAKER_04]: different statements to do with the user
friendliness, the trust and confidence
[SPEAKER_04]: that our recommendations will improve
yield, perceptions around risk and cost
[SPEAKER_04]: and affordability, market orientation,
attitude towards innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we look at all these things,
what comes out very clearly is that if you
[SPEAKER_04]: use variable selection methods to see
which sort of perceptions determine
[SPEAKER_04]: whether a farmer is going to make use of
your recommendations or not, what comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out in the very top is everything to do
with the user experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they can access the advice quickly
and it's all intuitive to use those tools,
[SPEAKER_04]: that is going to determine half way
already whether that farmer is going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: something with that advice or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with all the science we've invested,
you could actually argue that as much
[SPEAKER_04]: effort would need to be invested in making
those tools as user friendly as possible
[SPEAKER_04]: because that determines whether all that
will have any impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next in line, luckily for us
agronomists follows the perceptions around
[SPEAKER_04]: yield and revenue, some cost and market
access, and maybe surprisingly last in
[SPEAKER_04]: line is the attitude towards innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: How often do they actually interact with
extension services or have they made any
[SPEAKER_04]: investments in the farm in the past?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, AkiLimo, we're trying to
push it into, turn it into more of a
[SPEAKER_04]: community where people can contribute and
interact and turn it into a learning
[SPEAKER_04]: platform, making it available to the
extents and agronomy and transforming it
[SPEAKER_04]: into something that can grow and inspire a
lot of the work that will happen through
[SPEAKER_04]: extents and agronomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to acknowledge all the
organizations that have worked and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: people in these organizations and they are
really many.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't possibly name all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see from the logos that there are
really a lot of organizations,
[SPEAKER_04]: but many not mentioned here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'll stop here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to answer a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Bernard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to open the floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there questions for Peter Bernard?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please go ahead, Louis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was wondering if you have experience
with accessing farmers data such as like
[SPEAKER_05]: the planting date or how much did they
apply and how much did they actually
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way for you to access that data
via maybe smartphones or such
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies?
[SPEAKER_04]: On planting and harvest schedules,
we have quite a bit of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the research process,
we gathered that through surveys,
[SPEAKER_04]: but now that people are using our tools,
we actually get that information as part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the input to the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ask farmers when they plant and when
they intend to harvest to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: calculate sort of expected yield for that
planting and harvesting schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting yield data is actually a very
tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy and definitely not for a
crop like cassava, which is a root crop
[SPEAKER_04]: where often what you see above ground not
necessarily says much about what you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: find below ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've experimented with a couple of
methods to combine quick above ground
[SPEAKER_04]: measurements with minimal uprooting and
sampling of crop cuts and sampling plants
[SPEAKER_04]: with modest success, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: But getting yield data in smallholder
farms fields in a quick and sufficiently
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate way is, I think, still quite a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please go ahead, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw the tool, it looked very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave them one statement about what
they could expect to see, but you have
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that a lot of simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So couldn't you give them an uncertainty
estimate on that also to say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we think you will get if you
do this recommendation, but this is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that then allow them to make a kind
of a risk-based decision for themselves?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've tried several ways of actually
visualizing or explaining risk to
[SPEAKER_04]: smallholders, and that's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very often when you confront them with
ranges, they tend to forget the lower end
[SPEAKER_04]: and go for the upper end and get very
optimistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've actually done is ask them
how often they invest in technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then assume that farmers who often
invest in technologies are more the
[SPEAKER_04]: risk-loving type of farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what we do is we actually set our
threshold for profitability lower for
[SPEAKER_04]: those farmers than for farmers who never
invest and who can't afford losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's very clever.
Thanks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there more questions from the floor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Johannes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Bernhard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for coming, even if it's not
the traditional way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering, obviously you spent a lot
of time, and it looks superb, your
[SPEAKER_06]: interface to the farmers and populations
in rural communities where you employ
[SPEAKER_06]: really nifty tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that look on the upstream side?
[SPEAKER_06]: Bernhard, you mentioned your desire in
reaching out more in a more organized
[SPEAKER_06]: fashion to the academic research
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you spent a lot less time in employing
these kind of next generation tools to
[SPEAKER_06]: pull in knowledge and expertise and skills
from upstream as you do downstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something that you can learn from
the downstream side to engage both in more
[SPEAKER_06]: rapid iterations with innovation,
but also the longevity of building
[SPEAKER_06]: strategic partnerships?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's both of those,
and they're not going hand in hand
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering about that, what your
strategic thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one comment, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole initiative is new.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Peter has been showing is one project
that started in 2016, but the bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: picture I've tried, the boring part of the
seminar, that's the new initiative that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been constructed since maybe one year now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one, we recognize the need for
innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We recognize the need for linking with
things like Cornell, but we want that
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation box also to be demand driven to
a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to do the things we would
love to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do the things we should do in
response to needs and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it probably will be a little bit
opportunistic because you also need to
[SPEAKER_03]: explore new avenues in agronomy at scale,
and we will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to use the fields,
the sort of things that Peter has been
[SPEAKER_03]: showing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he referred to a few items which
were difficult or hard or not satisfying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these are very good entry points
into innovation R&D that we want to invest
[SPEAKER_03]: in to exactly increase the efficiency of
our agronomy workflows and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If all goes well, and there's an if with
the capital, if all goes well,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we'll probably start working on a
much more defined initiative probably from
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter two next year with an end line of
quarter four next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be an intensive period of
reflection on the sort of question you
[SPEAKER_03]: just asked, but many other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be a good time to
touch base again, Johannes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy, can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Janice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Janice and then Harold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please go ahead, Janice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in knowing the role of soil
analysis underpinning all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how much of that is done or do you
really rely on historical yields to
[SPEAKER_02]: predict what's needed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess my question is really leading
to whether the soil doc system is involved
[SPEAKER_02]: here, whether that's part of this program
or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you try, Peter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can comment on... Yeah, go ahead,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Though at some point we had some
discussions with Patrick and we wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: try out whether having the soil doc data
as additional covariates in our prediction
[SPEAKER_04]: model would improve our predictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I showed, we currently rely on the
soil width data alongside with local
[SPEAKER_04]: information that the farmer provides
himself or herself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't include actual measures of
soil data at this point because most
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers would not have such data,
obviously, for their farms.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the key that we thought about at
some point, but haven't really
[SPEAKER_04]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the key point, Peter, is that if
you use all those geospatially information
[SPEAKER_03]: layers that are available, everything you
know, even the soil grids, anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you predict what inherent nutrient
capacity would be, you don't get very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you add one measure of local
quality to that, you get very well to 0.7,
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: With 0.7, 0.8, you can do business.
[SPEAKER_03]: With 0.3, you cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that local, what we've seen or what
Peter has shown is that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily need to analyze your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a pictorial appreciation of yield is
good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can imagine the cost and time and
effort to let people look at the picture
[SPEAKER_03]: or take a sample and analyze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a totally different ball
game.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that stand everywhere all the time
for all crops?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's nice to see it for cassava.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Janis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Harold, you had a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, thanks, gentlemen,
for an outstanding presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful slides and very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of following up on Janis'
question, so you're looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic soil properties and soil grids and
nutrient contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're also looking at,
in a way, yield potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to some extent, you're dancing
around the concept of soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your approach is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a way, maybe this is the general
quality or health of your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is then what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just wondering, you could also
sort of turn it around a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you can improve the productivity or
the health of your soil, whichever way you
[SPEAKER_01]: express that, if you do this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can make your soil more like this
other soil and thereby enhance the
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity of that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was wondering whether in your
communications through this app,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may have an opportunity to sort of
bring that concept also into the
[SPEAKER_01]: communications that you have with the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, you're mostly focused
on mineral fertilizers, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just was wondering whether you've
thought about taking that to a different
[SPEAKER_01]: level by bringing in concepts around soil
health and how you can help these farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of achieve higher yield potentials by
enhancing the quality of their soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the impression from my slides is
indeed that we heavily focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer, though this is just one use
case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in many of our tools, we actually
emphasize the importance for a farmer to
[SPEAKER_04]: know the productivity of his field.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often visualize also that you could
look at a field from being very poor to
[SPEAKER_04]: very fertile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's very poor, you need to think
about improving that soil by, we actually
[SPEAKER_04]: have in all our tools, you know,
promoting the use of manure or compost or
[SPEAKER_04]: crop residues and recycling those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also emphasizing these for long term
productivity that you need to maintain
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil, you need to avoid erosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all those things they definitely come
along with the advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the incentive for a farmer to invest
will always be the short term profit that
[SPEAKER_04]: he can realize from an investment in
tillage or fertilizer or a new variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just alongside with that, you really need
to provide also the advice of how to
[SPEAKER_04]: ensure long term productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I very much agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I answered your question
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harold, does that, you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it's a consideration to
think because I think you have a very rich
[SPEAKER_01]: data set that I think you could employ
probably effectively in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe helping farmers
understand, you know, how soil
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity can be enhanced, not only by
applying mineral fertilizers, but by
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, physical biological sort
of approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a way, you have so much data at
hand that I think with some creative
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, you could really enhance that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just an opportunity that I
just sort of wanted to point out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really have really good
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's something there that
could be pursued.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Harold, the main entry point
towards improved soil health is via the
[SPEAKER_03]: organic resource pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the most viable,
you know, entry points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know in a lot of those systems,
the most limiting resource is organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you increase the availability of
organic matter if you don't have follow
[SPEAKER_03]: systems anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we've always seen
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow passing through crop residues is a
good way forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that to produce crop residues,
you need your nutrients and so on and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in fallow systems, which do
still exist in large parts of Africa,
[SPEAKER_03]: the situation is of course different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you have those resources
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a mix of, you know, knowledge and
availability of resources that will drive
[SPEAKER_03]: what are your entry points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Towards better yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyway, just adding on.
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be a rich subject for when you
guys... This is something we should
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss when we are live in Cornell,
you know, and... Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: September, Bernard.
[SPEAKER_03]: September.
[SPEAKER_03]: September next year, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll all be vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are way over now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been very generous with your
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really fantastic joint
presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really look forward to, as we said,
inviting you to spend time with us in the
[SPEAKER_07]: fall and some of these new projects mature
and affording, of course, the opportunity
[SPEAKER_07]: for deeper discussions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But on behalf of everyone who's attended,
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really deeply appreciate it that you
guys made time for this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thank you also for making time for
listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's keep this discussion warm,
Andy, and colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again, Bernard and Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to you on Monday, Bernard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
