[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations to the class of 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we have not yet had our
2020 commencement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Commencement is my favorite activity of
the year to celebrate all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once commencement is set for 2020,
we look forward to welcoming both you and
[SPEAKER_02]: your families back to campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this sure didn't end the way any of
us planned, but we want you to know how
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely proud we are of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are proud of you, particularly because
you've persevered through these last few
[SPEAKER_06]: months of our people.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you stayed in Ithaca, you experienced
snow in May a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you left Ithaca, you probably did so
with little time to say goodbye to friends
[SPEAKER_06]: and professors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of you experienced the challenges
and joys of remote teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of what has happened has taken away
from the hard work you've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: From organic chemistry, to statistics,
to the outstanding job each of you did
[SPEAKER_06]: during your presentations in the senior
seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: In between, we shared meals, went on field
trips together, and some of us traveled
[SPEAKER_06]: together to distant lands.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope your Cornell experience has been
special and that you graduate with the
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge, skills, networks, and
confidence to be successful in whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: path you take.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are one step closer to becoming our
professional colleagues.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be delighted to hear from you no
matter how many years after you graduate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have experienced one of the most
unusual semesters that anyone could have
[SPEAKER_03]: imagined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've done it with grace and
resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that this sense of persistence that
has gotten you through this semester and
[SPEAKER_03]: your time at Cornell carries you through
this summer and beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best wishes for a joyous future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to take this opportunity to
congratulate all of you on your amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: achievements while at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly wishing you the very best as
you move into the next chapter of your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal and academic lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly please stay in touch with
all of our faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're always interested to know the
great things that you all achieve in the
[SPEAKER_01]: coming years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations!
[SPEAKER_04]: You did it!
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone got together and made it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you leave here with new friends and
colleagues and also a thorough knowledge
[SPEAKER_04]: of the understanding of science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Science isn't a bunch of facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Science is a process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a way of knowing about the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: The eureka moments are fantastic,
but it's really about looking at that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and saying, whoa, that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what drives science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes a collaboration of people to
get this kind of work done.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one person knows everything about
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what makes it so interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So travel the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know other people and cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collaborate widely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you love and happiness and success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to always cherish the diversity in
this world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Class of 2020.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to wish you all the best as
you go out into a world that is so
[SPEAKER_11]: different than when you started at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be good to each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And looking forward to hearing what you're
up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are extremely proud of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fantastic to have you as a student
during the last four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are sure that you will perform greatly
in any path that you decide to take.
[SPEAKER_08]: To all the graduating seniors,
you made it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just enjoy the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope to see you back at Cornell sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just here to congratulate you on
your graduation.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed your time with Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish you well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have wished to congratulate you in
person and shake your hand and wish you
[SPEAKER_07]: all the best for the future in person.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm very, very proud of you that you
made it this far.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you completed this course even in
these extraordinary times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely memorable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great pleasure to know you and
work with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish you all the best in your future
academic career.
[SPEAKER_12]: And your personal life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Be persistent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Aim high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never give up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations, plant science graduates
of the class of 2020.
[SPEAKER_10]: Job well done.
[SPEAKER_10]: And mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please stay in touch.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to hear how everyone's doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once again, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, congratulations from the bottom of
my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, 2020 plant science grads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on, get out there and get after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, plant sciences majors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you great success in your future.
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations to the entire class of
2020.
[SPEAKER_12]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.

[SPEAKER_09]: It's really gone.
