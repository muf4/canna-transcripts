[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Protect Your Bald Head Hat,
is what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do, Mike Brown,
who is my, this guy is the best research
[SPEAKER_00]: support specialist, certainly in New York
State, possibly in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has been really my right-hand man for
what, 12 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg was also involved in quite a bit
of the work that we're going to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want them both to come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to just do a quick walk
through, because it doesn't look like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through the orchard up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg, I'm hoping you can talk,
since this is Greg's PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll swing through, and I'll
talk a little bit about apple replant
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll probably come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to, it's full bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to have an excuse to walk in the
orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was Greg's PhD planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to, I want Greg to do most of
the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of the history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Liberty, which is, a lot of people
consider it the most disease resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: apple that's ever been developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Cornell apple, has McCown and a
bunch of other stuff in its parentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rick Risenger, Rick's not here,
but he was a really key person that I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with during the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the trees that you see,
except for those, I think Rick planted was
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous having an orchard manager who was
as much of a fanatic as I was about
[SPEAKER_00]: planning new stuff and seeing how it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted this in 1994, just because
we wanted to have some scab immune stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: here and to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, why don't you tell us about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a holler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this whole plot is about an acre or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Liberty on M9, a dwarfing root
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was planted here for different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually the summer before I came in,
Ian had two undergraduate students,
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily Vollmer and Christine Averill start
on a project here looking at organic
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and integrated fruit production,
which is the conventional system in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the state really, which is a low input,
soft program integrating insect control
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrient management and water
management into a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal of the project was to
really look at can we do organic here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast, which is very difficult
with the large pest complex that we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 some odd arthropod pests and another 20
different fungi and bacteria and other
[SPEAKER_01]: disease agents that really are difficult
to control even in conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can we do an organic system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also let's look at this European
system, this IFP system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had four replications of each of the
treatments in this plot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran the study for, we had four years
of data on it and looked at everything
[SPEAKER_01]: from soil ecology through productivity of
the trees, fruit quality, nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: content of the fruit, consumer sensory
panels, environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a very holistic sort of project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wrote the publication that Ian
showed as well out of the organic side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long and short of it is that yeah,
you can do organic if the premium is high
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to get the return on investment,
which is required for the additional pest
[SPEAKER_01]: control practices that you need to do and
loss of fruit, somewhat smaller fruit size
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get and the additional hand
labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's doable and it's an economic
question more than a feasibility question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with that though, hasn't really taken
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hoping maybe some people would be
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know anecdotally there's still some
experimentation with organic in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast, but we'll see where the future
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IFP system has largely been
incorporated into new systems such as the
[SPEAKER_01]: GAP, the Good Agricultural Practices
systems that are now that the supermarket
[SPEAKER_01]: and the retailers are really requiring for
the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slowly that's becoming the standard
here as it has in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I spent a lot of time out here as
part of the most micromanaged organic
[SPEAKER_01]: plots in the Northeast at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it still being managed organically?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still being managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the whole block is now down to
the edge and we had the NOFA New York
[SPEAKER_00]: inspector here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was that, Eric?
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago about and they looked at it and
basically said no problem if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: certify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the few organic comparisons
with other systems that was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated instead of pseudo replicated
where you're comparing this farm to that
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a good experimental design
that we had set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only planting I've ever
managed that I've gotten a call from
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Health and Safety and said
what the hell are you guys doing out
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like there's a bunch of dead
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the thinning treatment
that we use here is lime sulfur and
[SPEAKER_00]: crockers fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've driven in here in the
summer, this whole thing is whitewashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the surround.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very effective organic insect repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thinning that we do is lime
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination of dead fish and rotten
eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great stuff to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I describe it as Jersey Shore and
apologies to those who are from the Jersey
[SPEAKER_01]: Shore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coincidentally in every year it
turned out this way and I didn't do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose but it always turned out I had to
put that application on a commencement
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it just turned out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm a believer in quitting
while you're ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Taryn!
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to talk about your root boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit, you gotta holler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stand here, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had one open.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, these are root boxes as Ian
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are basically, if we could pull the
lid off of one of these, what you would
[SPEAKER_03]: find inside is basically mylar sheets on
each side of these root boxes so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can actually observe the roots growing
against them over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with apples is that unlike
almost every other tree, crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant I've ever worked with, they have
such a minimal root system compared
[SPEAKER_03]: comparatively and so we have a really
actually difficult time finding roots on
[SPEAKER_03]: these trees and so these are installed
about a year ago or so now but it'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: exciting this spring to open them up and
see what we found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year when we checked in, there was
hardly anything there and it was somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: disappointing but fingers are crossed for
this year and hopefully we'll find
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there worse than grapes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Much worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grapes have like ten times as many roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grapes are the poster child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had, I think we had 60
observation to how many do we have out
[SPEAKER_00]: here, Mike, when we had the rhizotron
tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it 60?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work, when Sean Gree was coming
doing weekly observations, I think we only
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up with something like 80 roots and
the whole damn orchard that happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the tube, I mean you actually made
me kind of nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the wind blows, I think the orchard's
just going to blow away because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have much of a root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm amazed at how apples do it
with such a minimal root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must be incredibly mycorrhizal is all
I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots, the ones they do have are
pretty active I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was what's the root stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six different root stocks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the replant experiment that I
was talking about in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old tree rows went this way and the
pre-plant treatments went this way and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're blocked five times from east to
west and then the, so there were four
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-plant treatments, you remember,
blocked, repped five times by the blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: and then each tree basically is,
they've all got, well most of them still
[SPEAKER_00]: have tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, each tree is a replicate of the
factorial combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been pretty stunning,
the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now, I mean that, even after what,
10 years I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2001 when we actually planted these
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they're not converging at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in a replant study where people
have looked a few in fumigation as a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, you get this big difference for
three or four years where the trees in
[SPEAKER_00]: fumigated ground are just bigger and more
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after about 10 years,
they kind of come together and that has
[SPEAKER_00]: not happened with these root stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was, for me, for 20 years,
you know, I would work on replant and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was all totally empirical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd do something and then we'd come back
and we'd measure how the trees grew or how
[SPEAKER_00]: much fruit they produced or how much
nitrogen they took up and this was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time we ever said, you know what,
I want to know why are they doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really one of the first
mechanistic, and it was great being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with Janice and having grad
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Greg also did a fair amount of
molecular work in the Liberty there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was a big step to just sort of
make that transition to, I used to be one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those somewhat of a Luddite,
I guess, where, you know, we all used to
[SPEAKER_00]: make nasty remarks about molecular
biologists and, you know, how they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything useful, but it's,
I've really come to realize that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty stupid because the truth is,
it's just, they're just techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're incredibly powerful techniques
that you can apply in agricultural systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that enable you to understand what's
happening, why it's happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really powerful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a student and you think,
oh, this is not my cup of tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg can attest, I always told my
students, you're going to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply these techniques while you're here
because it's crazy if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep walking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we published that all that stuff
threatened to lie down in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulldozer when our, our values,
people wanted to get rid of these trees
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the oldest trees in the whole
orchard 19, actually we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth of the matter is we didn't keep
very good records at this orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know exactly when the first
trees were planted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it was around 1908 or 1909.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these trees are probably from the
early 1920s, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Ken?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, we need a dendrochronologist out
here actually to take some, take a core
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell us exactly when these trees were
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we keep them around the,
the guys and the crew understandably are,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually used to prune these with my
orchard management class until the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment people said, you know,
maybe you shouldn't have a student on 18
[SPEAKER_00]: foot ladders with chainsaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not quite, but it's,
it's, I love having them here because
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this is kind of the history of the
apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good for students to be
able to show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what orchards look like 40 by 40
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other remarkable thing,
I mean, look at the bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tree is almost a hundred years old
and it's just raring to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope springs eternal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good thing to look at when
you're about to retire here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are all grafted on seedling
roots and they're courtlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, these may be the oldest living
courtland trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was a name variety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And courtland for those who aren't
familiar, it's a Cornell apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the earliest introductions of the
Geneva apple breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: McCown and Courtland were right back there
about the same era, early 1900s,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 1920.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 was when courtland was named,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll quickly walk through here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justine, can you come here for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want Justine to talk a little bit
about this, this vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell us, tell us why it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of our teaching vineyards
and we call it the pool block named after
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Poole, who was a viticulturist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was my favorite viticulturist who
designed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a real mix of stuff through
here at the, at the very far end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm guessing we're going to walk that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually the Geneva double
curtain, which is a very good trailer
[SPEAKER_02]: system where he divided the canopies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did all the research down in Fredonia
and those people are upset that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: called the Geneva double curtain and not
the Fredonia double curtain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, it is a difficult topic
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was then widely used by the Concord
industry for a long time and is starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to fall out of favor now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he put in a rotational program so
that students could work with very young
[SPEAKER_02]: vines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got Concord and Ceball that range
from zero to five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some different spacings of vines
and fir prune versus cane pruned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some of what at the time were
Bruce's bruising selections, but are now
[SPEAKER_02]: named cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some coro noir through here,
which was the 70 number, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The New York 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus some older Dishonak too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Dishonak, one thing we do and Steve
Lurch does a lot of the work in here for
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching purposes, is we'll prune the
Dishonak to zero nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no nodes at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it technically shouldn't have any
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that crazy cultivar will go six times
an acre on zero nodes because it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really fruitful from the latent buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a whole selection of
table grapes, which Eric and you guys take
[SPEAKER_02]: care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then harvest them out there at the
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them from the Cornell Bruising
Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like mindset seedless is a popular
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we basically have in this
block.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple other teaching blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: One up on the, that we call the hilltop
block that Ian actually planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next to that is an organic block,
actually certified by NOFA New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: that Ian and I and Kathy Arnick,
our enology lecturer, who's here
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we planted and we use for a class
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it, Bob Poole was my nemesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I decided I wanted to get involved in
viticulture, I said, well, what can I
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, probably I can help get some
vineyards established because we had none.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called Bob Poole up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Bob, will you tell me what
varieties you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to try to get some plantings
established for this new program we're
[SPEAKER_00]: developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Merwin, you will do that over
my dead body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was furious because he saw
viticulture was Geneva's thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did not want Ithaca to have any of
that action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we named the block after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just poetic justice, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been great for me the last 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it has been now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd gotten to a point in my Apple research
where I kind of accomplished a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I got another 10 good years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do that will make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to hire all these great viticulture
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to hire Cathy to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got a really quality
program that's still in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now we're looking for
another person who will be primarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulturist to fill the line that I used
to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for any home winemakers out there,
we do sell all the grapes from our student
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can actually press them here for
you and you can have the juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can either have grapes or have the
juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're interested, keep us in mind
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bruce, did you get to try the cider
that was in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed how fast it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must confess it was it was two gallons
of cider that just vaporized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the red color for those of you that
did try it actually was noire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some noire that nobody wanted to buy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of starting to raisin in my
core and said, well, I'm going to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the cider and just see what it
tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really spicy grape with lots of
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it might give the cider some
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is just a little touch of noire
that if you know what the grape smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like, do you think it's detectable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I'll use noire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might use something that's not quite as
pungent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can sell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should probably head back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
