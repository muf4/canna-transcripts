[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all so much for the chance to be
here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been really fun, both the
conversations I've had over the last two
[SPEAKER_04]: days, and also just getting to wander
around campus again after about 15 years
[SPEAKER_04]: since I first showed up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a conversation at dinner last
night about some of the digital ag stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that is going on here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to highlight, before I get into
my talk, this is my research group as of
[SPEAKER_04]: last summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at the University of Nebraska,
Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the stuff I'm going to tell
you about is only possible because we were
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborating with folks like Yu Funga,
who's a biological systems engineer,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Yu Mo and Yu Hong, who are both
statisticians at the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really being able to work with
folks across different disciplines that
[SPEAKER_04]: lets us do really, really cool stuff that,
to me, seems extraordinarily hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to them, it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get to turn that around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Brandy Sigmund, who is an actual
developmental geneticist, which is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to start with a broad
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to move into some
economics, then into some quantitative
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics, and come back to broad
conceptual stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that broad question here, which is one
of the central questions of all genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: is how do we find which genes determine
the characteristics of maize or any
[SPEAKER_04]: organism?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to bring this up because I want
you to think about what actually we mean
[SPEAKER_04]: when we say the word gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I first started out in grad
school, the maize genome had just come
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were about 32,000 gene models.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was a revision that went up
from about 32,000 to about 40,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another revision that went up to about
60,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about the time that I got my own lab,
we were adding about 5,000 genes to the
[SPEAKER_04]: genome every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if it takes one grad student five
years to characterize one gene,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see that just for maize,
we would need about 25,000 graduate
[SPEAKER_04]: students.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about $1.25 billion a year in funding
to keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously, this would not be
sustainable for a lot of reasons working
[SPEAKER_04]: with government policy and NSF and all
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also is clearly not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maize is not adding a lot of new genes to
the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was happening is we were using
different criteria and had different
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence for what constitutes a gene
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go into Google Scholar and you
type in what is a gene, you will find this
[SPEAKER_04]: review from more than a decade ago now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they proposed this very complicated
and almost legalistic definition of what a
[SPEAKER_04]: gene is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say that Ed mentioned I've
worked with some companies and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: some very good things about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the negative things is you spend a
lot of time talking to lawyers about IP
[SPEAKER_04]: law and organizational law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to have control of which part
of the company if one of the partners gets
[SPEAKER_04]: divorced?
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the partners who aren't married
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it feels like a lot of pressure to have
to be divorced before you get married.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so I would say that this is a
definition that only a lawyer could be
[SPEAKER_04]: happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go back to the origin of the
term gene, and I didn't know this until
[SPEAKER_04]: about six months ago, it was originally
proposed by this Danish geneticist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not the original Danish.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a translation to German.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know just enough German to find the
right sentence to paste into Google
[SPEAKER_04]: Translate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The word gene is completely free of any
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only expresses the assured fact that at
any rate, many characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_04]: organism are conditioned by special
separable and therefore self-existent
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamentals that occur in the gametes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So genes are the things in the genome that
actually control the characteristics of
[SPEAKER_04]: the organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to argue, yeah, not all gene
models are going to correspond to genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the wonderful things about the
grasses is that they have very conserved
[SPEAKER_04]: sentinel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sentinel is the conservation of the
same genes in the same order.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you're seeing here is a graphic
from Koji, which is an online comparative
[SPEAKER_04]: genomics tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's run by Eric Lyons at University of
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each of these, we have a nice gene
model comparing a region in rice,
[SPEAKER_04]: in foxtail millet, in sorghum,
and in maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these red-orange boxes are regions of
homologous sequence identified on BLAST.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you can see is that we have some
of the same genes in the same order.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a tandem duplication in
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have two copies of this particular
gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this might be Phytochrome B.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to check on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have these genes that are gene
models that are conserved at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: locations across all the grasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have lots of gene models that are
not conserved at the same locations in
[SPEAKER_04]: different grasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are synthetic orthologous genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are non-synthetic genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that we see them here but not
in other species means that they inserted
[SPEAKER_04]: into their present location in the genome
since the divergence of these different
[SPEAKER_04]: species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at the genes that actually
have known characterized functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some geneticists walk through a field.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, that plant is so interestingly
weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to spend those five years of my
life figuring out what is the gene
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for why that plant looks
weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those genes are eight times as likely to
be these conserved synthetic genes as the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-conserved, the non-synthetic genes,
which are evolutionarily more recent,
[SPEAKER_04]: and may or may not have functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's also an argument that maybe
these non-synthetic genes are involved in
[SPEAKER_04]: processes that aren't as immediately
obvious as you walk through the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's at least one exception where that
is the case, which is if you look at
[SPEAKER_04]: disease resistance genes, these are almost
always the non-synthetic fraction of the
[SPEAKER_04]: genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of these genes do appear to be
sequences with the potential to code for
[SPEAKER_04]: protein, or that actually do code for
protein, but they're in search of a
[SPEAKER_04]: functional role still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are lots of other ways that you
can see differences between the conserved
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they tend to have very different
methylation profiles, the synthetically
[SPEAKER_04]: conserved genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The non-synthetic genes tend to look a lot
like intergenic sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Synthetic genes are expressed at higher
levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from a Wall-E paper a couple years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more interesting to me, if you look at
non-synthetic genes, which are expressed,
[SPEAKER_04]: they make significant amounts of mRNA,
they're much less likely to have that mRNA
[SPEAKER_04]: translated into protein than the conserved
synthetic genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this would be very consistent with them
having fewer phenotypic consequences,
[SPEAKER_04]: because even though there are ways to
produce phenotypic consequences without
[SPEAKER_04]: making a protein, it's a lot easier to
have a phenotype if you do make a protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: So given a lot of these differences,
we put together just a very simple PCA
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here is a 2D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you're seeing essentially a kernel
density plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of both all the annotated gene models in
red here and these gold standard genes
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been identified based on a
forward genetic phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a subset of the trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put about a dozen traits into this
basic PC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on ones we knew that there were
significant differences between genes with
[SPEAKER_04]: known phenotypes and those without.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that there's a relatively large
separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the annotated genes in the
maize genome are concentrated over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more likely to show up to show
presence-absence variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're less likely to be satinically
conserved.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're less likely to show evidence of
being translated into protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the genes with known phenotypes and
the cluster over on this side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this, I'm going to give you a few
takeaways from this very broad idea,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is that we really do need to
remember that gene models are hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a gene model is a hypothesis that this
particular portion of the genome is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually a gene that actually plays a role
in determining the phenotype of an
[SPEAKER_04]: organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been very guilty of this myself,
that I sort of treat all gene models as
[SPEAKER_04]: equally likely to cause phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wouldn't treat that any other kind
of hypothesis the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some hypotheses that are more
likely to be true, some that are less
[SPEAKER_04]: likely to be true.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that seem very unexpected that
then end up being consistent with
[SPEAKER_04]: observation are really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can do a lot to prioritize which
hypotheses make sense to test,
[SPEAKER_04]: which hypotheses you spend a lot of time
studying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we do a lot better job of this
with gene models as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come back to that at the very
end of the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now to jump a little bit from very
broad, how do we identify the genes likely
[SPEAKER_04]: to have any phenotypic consequence to
linking specific genes to specific
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was meeting with some folks at the lab
yesterday, and they had reconstructed
[SPEAKER_04]: almost this exact same slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think probably everyone working in
high-density phenotyping has a version of
[SPEAKER_04]: this, which is that genotyping has gone
from extraordinarily expensive to
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially a trivial part of the cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, collecting the samples and doing
the DNA extractions may cost more at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point when you factor in the labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phenotyping, on the other hand,
has not gotten substantially cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that's probably gone up because
the cost of human labor, particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: skilled human labor, is going up faster
than inflation.
[SPEAKER_04]: High throughput phenotyping is a reaction
to the recognition of this imbalance
[SPEAKER_04]: between the decreasing cost of genotyping
and the constant or increasing cost of
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also an interesting concept because
there's not a good definition of
[SPEAKER_04]: high-throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's defined by what it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So high-throughput phenotyping is not
driving a combine through the field and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is not sending a bunch of students
into the field with protractors and rulers
[SPEAKER_04]: and notebooks to write things down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the students who are willing to do
that are willing to go out on a cornfield
[SPEAKER_04]: or a sorghum field in the middle of summer
here in Ithaca, Nebraska, they're a very
[SPEAKER_04]: limited pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we can really grow that pool
very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a non-renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we want to get more data,
we need other strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And either of those two things,
you can say that you're high-throughput
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotyping as long as you're measuring
something about plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now we want to invest a lot in
high-throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not clear what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to walk you through the three
major steps, the three major bottlenecks
[SPEAKER_04]: we found in terms of actually using this
to do something useful to understand how
[SPEAKER_04]: plants work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a little flowchart here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, three transitions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So growing plants, I do know how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not great at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kill them occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can grow plants, and we can collect
rates from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first challenge is an engineering
challenge, which is once you have all
[SPEAKER_04]: these plants, how do you collect new and
interesting kinds of data from them other
[SPEAKER_04]: than having somebody out there with a
notebook?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is an engineering challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned I'm fortunate to work with
this engineer, Yufeng Du, at the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we both have this field-based system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank is a former postdoc in Yufeng's lab
who's now on staff just to keep this
[SPEAKER_04]: field-based system up and running where we
have a large payload that can move back
[SPEAKER_04]: and forth throughout the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can send up both heavier and more
expensive instruments on this than we
[SPEAKER_04]: could on a drone because we don't have to
worry about it crashing or veering off.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other system, which came online about
the same time I was hired at the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Nebraska, is just one of
these conveyor belt greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may have visited Dan Forth or
Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've seen these.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that sets Nebraska's apart from
other people's is not that we can grow
[SPEAKER_04]: more plants, not that we're cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really expensive to run, but the fact
that we can grow plants to such a large
[SPEAKER_04]: size.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this facility, we can grow plants
up to about 2.3 meters and still move them
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here and have them imaged with a series of
cameras every day, collect weights and the
[SPEAKER_04]: specific amount of water being used by
each plant each day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's enough to grow grain type
sorghums all the way to maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's enough to grow some but not all maize
inbreds to maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you try and grow maize hybrids on this,
they get above that 2.3 meter threshold
[SPEAKER_04]: and start hitting into the ceiling as they
go through and the plants toppling over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not very much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turns out the greenhouse staff
have to detassle your plants so they can
[SPEAKER_04]: still move through the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: At which point, I would argue there's not
a lot of useful quantitative data.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you get out of this is a series
of different imaging types.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here is one plant being
imaged on one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have an RGB camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant is photographed from different
angles around about 180 degree arc.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have a thermal IR camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice that the plant is about the
same color as the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because originally these plants sat
in the dark for about 10 minutes before
[SPEAKER_04]: they were imaged, at which point they
equilibrate with air temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've now fixed this by having a tunnel
where they're under high light and exposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to the same heat and air conditions as in
the greenhouse before they're imaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of this camera, which I'm not
going to talk about very much today,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a hyperspectral camera, which I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you know, in the human eye,
we have three different cones to perceive
[SPEAKER_04]: different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hyperspectral camera, in this case,
is perceiving 243 distinct wavelengths of
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are lots of colors that are going
to look the same to your eye or mine that
[SPEAKER_04]: can be distinguished with this camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have lots and lots of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working with great engineers to
collect the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a step that I think is
underappreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably you folks do appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you talk to people outside of the
plant biology community, it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: do QTL mapping or GWAS or anything on a
bunch of pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually seen people propose ways to
do that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really what we need is a giant
spreadsheet of numerical measurements of
[SPEAKER_04]: something we care about with the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that becomes a computer vision or a
machine learning challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we go with pictures or LIDAR point
clouds or hyperspectral data cubes and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually measure things we care about with
the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of approaches to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to tell you about a couple
things going on in my lab that I think are
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one approach is to use neural nets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you give the computer lots and lots of
pictures with known traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll learn from that how to score new
pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge we have is that even though
we have all these phenotyping facilities
[SPEAKER_04]: actually getting enough training data to
train a neural net can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is work actually by an
undergraduate in my lab, Tom Hoban,
[SPEAKER_04]: who took software that was originally
designed to make 3D models of plants for
[SPEAKER_04]: video games and used this to create models
of corn plants, which he can insert into a
[SPEAKER_04]: semi-accurate replication of the same
chamber we were collecting real plants
[SPEAKER_04]: from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a matter of about eight hours,
he could make about 26,000 of these
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic corn plants with different
parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And known 3D structures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked out what it would have cost to
grow these on the actual phenotyping
[SPEAKER_04]: facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about $80,000 worth of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can use these simulated images to
train a computer to predict real images.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're looking at here is prediction
of leaf counting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just show pictures to two different
people and have them count the number of
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves on the corn plant, the correlation
is about 0.9.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good, but it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing to recognize is we're not
going to get a perfect correlation,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we can't get perfect correlation
between different human beings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our goal is 0.9.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not able to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this is showing, and I won't walk you
through in too much detail, is that when
[SPEAKER_04]: data is very scarce, so about 300 images
per class or less, adding in the synthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: data actually improves our accuracy over
just using the real images.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are not particularly accurate
representations of a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's recognizably a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's clearly a lot more we can do to
make this look more like a corn plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: so increase the usefulness of simulated
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one approach to teaching
computers how to measure things from
[SPEAKER_04]: images.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is those taking advantage of
things like hyperspectral cameras,
[SPEAKER_04]: which perceive the world in very different
ways the way a human being does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here is a hyperspectral
data cube from a particular sorghum plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is work from Alejandro Pages,
who is a computer science undergraduate in
[SPEAKER_04]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what he did is he took a bunch of
these images, put them up on a web tool
[SPEAKER_04]: called Zooniverse, which is a citizen
science tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of this, if you go on the
website, it's like game cameras in Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there zebras in the images?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many zebras?
[SPEAKER_04]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we put up all these sorghum plants and
just asked people to say, OK, where are
[SPEAKER_04]: the stems?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the leaves?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the petals?
[SPEAKER_04]: And miraculously, some people were willing
to do that, even given the option of
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at cool zebras and giraffes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we very rapidly got a training data set
of about 8,000 data points, each of which
[SPEAKER_04]: is one pixel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within each pixel, we have 243 different
wavelength intensities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at that, we can develop very
separate reflectance parameters for what
[SPEAKER_04]: these different classes of pixels look
like, the leaf, the stalk, the pentacle,
[SPEAKER_04]: the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as a human being, it's very easy to
look at a standard picture of a sorghum
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and tell me where is the leaf,
where is the stem, where is the pentacle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out to be a very challenging
problem for the computer to do that from
[SPEAKER_04]: the RGB image.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the hyperspectral data,
the computer can do a very good job of
[SPEAKER_04]: separating these different classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I think is actually cool
is it does make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see what it's doing is it
thinks that the midribs of the sorghum
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves are stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this dense, lignified tissue,
and that's getting misclassified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even the mistakes are things that make
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so the nice thing about being able to
separate out the different parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: sorghum plant is we can start to measure
traits that make more sense biologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the first things whenever
students join the lab is they learn how to
[SPEAKER_04]: segment out just, this is an RGB photo of
sorghum plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually the same sorghum
plant over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the image is segmented, so we have the
plant pixels circled in red.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see there's some mistakes down
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's possible to measure the whole
height of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you will note is that the height of
the whole plant goes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then goes down, because as the flag
leaf first comes up, it's pointing
[SPEAKER_04]: straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as the pinnacle starts to emerge,
the angle of that leaf changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get this bump in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: By having this organ-aware segmentation,
we can instead look at the same sorghum
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and look at just the height of the
stem and pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we get a much more consistent
growth curve that is doing a better job of
[SPEAKER_04]: reflecting how the plant is growing than
looking at the total height, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: influenced just by this leaf sort of
flapping up and down as the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is important because when you
look at a lot of traits that are measured
[SPEAKER_04]: from hyperspectral or from phenotyping
data, you'll get something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are two traits, just plant height
and biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we've got ground truth,
which is measured again by students with
[SPEAKER_04]: rollers and notebooks and scales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the estimated measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for both of these from the images.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these correlations look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a question that my student Jukani
thought to ask, though, is the error
[SPEAKER_04]: that's left here, is it random?
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's random error, we'll just throw
more plants at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get really good accurate estimates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it systematic?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he found was that it was
systematic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were certain genotypes that were
systematically having their biomass
[SPEAKER_04]: underpredicted and others that were
systematically having their biomass
[SPEAKER_04]: overpredicted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about half of that variation is
heritable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's controlled by genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are differences in the
architecture of the plant that are
[SPEAKER_04]: producing systematic errors in our
measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we were using this to do,
say, train a genomic prediction model for
[SPEAKER_04]: biomass, we wouldn't just be predicting
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd also be predicting the phenotypes
that lead to errors in measurement of
[SPEAKER_04]: biomass from phenotyping data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is important if we can get getting
more accuracy is very important,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just because it's more accuracy,
but because we're removing systematic
[SPEAKER_04]: biases in the way that the data is being
collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now to the fun bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gone from growing plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've developed robots and sensors and
things to collect data and then computer
[SPEAKER_04]: algorithms to turn all that data into
giant spreadsheets full of numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really am a biologist at heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to actually map some genes or
find something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some interesting
quantitative genetics challenges,
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities, whatever you want to call
them, that occur because of the types of
[SPEAKER_04]: data that are produced by hyperkinetyping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the same sorghum plant from the
last section.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the two different measurements
of height.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also see the heritability of
height as measured by these two methods,
[SPEAKER_04]: both from the individual data points and
also from fitting a nonparametric curve to
[SPEAKER_04]: each of the heights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that, generally,
the heritability from the fitted curve is
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit higher than from the raw
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a perfect pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think this is because we're able to
borrow data from adjacent data points to
[SPEAKER_04]: get a more accurate measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another student in my lab, Chenyang
Yao, is working on using this to do
[SPEAKER_04]: mapping in the sorghum association panel,
which is a population of about 400 sorghum
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, most of which are conversion lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were collected from all over the
world across to the US germplasm to
[SPEAKER_04]: intergress both photoperiod and
sensitivity genes that will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: flower if we grow them in the summer in
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also dwarfing genes so that they will
be plants like this and not plants taller
[SPEAKER_04]: than the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you grow this population in the
field and you're interested in plant
[SPEAKER_04]: height, it's very easy to map two of the,
at least two, maybe three of the large
[SPEAKER_04]: effect genes that are involved in sorghum
height because there are still some very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very tall sorghum plants in our
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I mentioned in the greenhouse,
we can only grow plants about 2.3 meters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we take out the extremely tall
plants that are producing a strong signal
[SPEAKER_04]: and use the same data, we now are not able
to map any of these dwarfing genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know they're real.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know where they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know we can't find them with the
population we're going to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here are the height curves
of a large number of the different sorghum
[SPEAKER_04]: plants collected from this experiment in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is days after planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the height in centimeters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that when the plant gets
ready to have the panicle emerge,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have this large bolting response,
which happens at different times for
[SPEAKER_04]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just looks very, very messy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not quite clear what to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually pearl millet,
not sorghum, because it looks cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're seeing images.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these are collected every two days
of this pearl millet plant throughout its
[SPEAKER_04]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a human being, it's very easy to look
at this plant and see, oh, look,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's this transition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes from just making leaves to now it
has some panicles at the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes into senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will also notice that there's this
person who comes in and is doing some sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of maintenance during one of the days
while we were collecting images.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is a thing that is easy for
a human to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chen Yong was able to train a neural
net using less than 1,000 images to get
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively good accuracy at identifying
when is this transition point from
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetative development to reproductive
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's cool about this, again,
is that even the errors are the kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: errors a human might make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the transition point we're targeting is
when does the panicle first become
[SPEAKER_04]: visible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the computer, there's a little bit of
panicle shooting out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The computer misclassified this as not
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant is about to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The panicle is right here in the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the flag leaf up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the computer got confused and decided
this was a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are a lot of the same kinds of
mistakes that I would expect particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: a bored human being to make if I was
hiring high school students or people
[SPEAKER_04]: online or something to do these
classifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we have this classification data,
instead of using planting as our benchmark
[SPEAKER_04]: for comparing everything, we can shift the
data around to days before panicle
[SPEAKER_04]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we start to get much more similar
shapes of growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you'll notice is now we have
different time ranges measured for each
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with this, the first thing we can do
is just scan through and do genome-wide
[SPEAKER_04]: association study for height on every
different day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, as you can see, DWARF2 and
DWARF1, DWARF2, and DWARF4, which I think
[SPEAKER_04]: is not actually DWARF4.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show up and then later on in development
we don't catch anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's animated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's another way of displaying the
same data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see here on the y-axis is the
10 chromosomes of sorghum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going across, we've highlighted
genomic bins when there's at least one
[SPEAKER_04]: significant step in that day of the
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are several relatively long
peaks that correspond to some of the genes
[SPEAKER_04]: that we would expect to be able to map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either if we benchmark on days after
planting, or if we benchmark on days after
[SPEAKER_04]: pancreas emergence.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running lots and lots of GWAS here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I tell you where the known genes
are, you can find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's hard for me to look at this and
say with confidence, OK, we really have
[SPEAKER_04]: identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to identify because there's a lot
of noise also there in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where we started talking to
another statistician at the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Nebraska, Yuhang Xu.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a recent hire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his expertise is on working with
nonparametric regression and the curves
[SPEAKER_04]: you can generate from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually how do you break that down
into how different individuals vary with
[SPEAKER_04]: respect to those curves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see here in gray are all the curves
for all of the sorghum plants in our
[SPEAKER_04]: population, as well as both the empirical
estimate of sort of the center value or
[SPEAKER_04]: the average pattern and the estimated
pattern from his nonparametric regression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can then do a functional principal
component analysis to identify what are
[SPEAKER_04]: the major components of variation,
which is what you see on the other side of
[SPEAKER_04]: this slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So PC1, which explains about 2 thirds of
the variance, is essentially just taller
[SPEAKER_04]: versus shorter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So never really understand what determines
what's plus and what's minus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see if you have a more
negative value for PC1, the plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: taller essentially throughout development.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a more positive value of shorter.
[SPEAKER_04]: PC2, on the other hand, is essentially a
trade-off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have, and this explains another 20%
to 30%, I'm going to have it on a later
[SPEAKER_04]: slide, where you're taller earlier and
shorter later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now for every plant, we can describe
this curve as a combination of four
[SPEAKER_04]: principal components, these two explain
most of the variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can do GWAS just using these
principal components that describe the
[SPEAKER_04]: shape of the curve as our metrics instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we do that, we get some very
clean signals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So OK, 68% and 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: DWARF1 and DWARF2 are both identified with
principal component 1 and DWARF3 with
[SPEAKER_04]: principal component 2.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting about this is we
know a little bit about the biology of how
[SPEAKER_04]: these different genes affect plant height.
[SPEAKER_04]: So DWARF1, DWARF2 affect essentially all
the internodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: DWARF3 is affecting the lower internodes,
but not the elongation of the peduncle,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the stem that leads up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the panicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you'd expect here is this would
have a substantial effect on height before
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering, but then you wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I run them again backwards?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm not going to dig myself a
deeper hole in this slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm going to say is that they affect
height differently, and it's consistent
[SPEAKER_04]: with the patterns of the PCs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will defer to Chenyang, now my
student, on why that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we can integrate data across
multiple time points, and we're able to
[SPEAKER_04]: recover statistical power to identify
genes that we know are there, because we
[SPEAKER_04]: can identify them in a larger population
by integrating all this time series data.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have done this previously using
parametric models, where you decide,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, plants are going to grow and show a
logarithmic pattern of growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we found here was not actually that
different from logarithmic patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I like about it is it doesn't
force that assumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the really interesting stuff
in biology is the really weird,
[SPEAKER_04]: unexpected stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nonparametric curve fitting can
capture weird, unexpected stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas fitting the sigmoidal curves
cannot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the last quantitative genetics point I
want to talk about is the challenge of
[SPEAKER_04]: high dimensional or nearly high
dimensional data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically, I'm told by my
statistician collaborators, I cannot call
[SPEAKER_04]: it high dimensional until I've measured
more phenotypes from a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals in my population, which is a
high bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, I'm going to talk about having
hundreds of phenotypes, whether or not it
[SPEAKER_04]: is a truly high dimensional data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, because of both high phenotyping and
large collaborative projects, it's
[SPEAKER_04]: becoming more and more common to have
many, many traits toward the same
[SPEAKER_04]: population in biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also see this from medical data record
mining in humans, and also from large
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers of molecular phenotypes,
so looking at hundreds of metabolites or
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of gene expression levels across
whole populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this presents a challenge of
multiple testing, because the conventional
[SPEAKER_04]: approach to doing this would be to do
separate GWAS for every single trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this becomes a lot of tests very,
very fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a student in my lab, Chi Kai-Ling,
working with a statistician at Iowa State,
[SPEAKER_04]: was interested in trying some other
methods to deal with this data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the data set we used was from here at
Cornell with the Mays 282 Association
[SPEAKER_04]: Panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see that there were large
numbers of traits measured, and many of
[SPEAKER_04]: those traits were scored in up to 16
different environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a total of 260 trait data sets
to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the challenge of this is, so if we do
GWAS for any one trait, so what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing here is GWAS for a single SNP and a
single gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of having all the SNPs on the
x-axis, each of these represents the
[SPEAKER_04]: significance for one of the traits in the
data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I run a GWAS for one of these,
these are flowering time traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them are statistically
significant on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we take into account all the hypotheses
that are being tested across all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes, none of them are significant
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would like to be able to do some
sort of a more integrated test to utilize
[SPEAKER_04]: the data from all these traits together,
because clearly, if you're detecting the
[SPEAKER_04]: signal in many, many different
measurements of the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_04]: we should be able to sort of combine and
leverage that signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, the approach used here is first to
identify sets of SNPs within a gene to
[SPEAKER_04]: cluster and then select a single
representative SNP for group of markers
[SPEAKER_04]: that are in high LD with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first half of this model is just
looking at multiple SNPs, but a single
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype, and is fitting a very
complicated statistical model,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I will be up front as essentially a
black box to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can trust my statistical collaborator
and then test that the results that come
[SPEAKER_04]: out make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go through a step-wise selection procedure
to select subsets of all those of the
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes that show a significant signal
for that gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do a new comparison between our initial
model, which is attempting to explain the
[SPEAKER_04]: variation for all the SNPs within that
gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kept after filtering using both
principal components, population structure
[SPEAKER_04]: variation, as well as selected subset of
the traits from the whole 260 set.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say there's a preprint that we'll go
into the methodology here in a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the R code that was used up
on GitHub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the step-wise selection
procedure, there are essentially really
[SPEAKER_04]: large numbers of hypotheses that are being
tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the p-value distribution we see is
quite skewed relative to what we would
[SPEAKER_04]: expect from the number of tests we're
actually running instead of implicitly
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up doing a lot of permutation
testing just to determine what is the
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution of p-value as we would expect
to see, because they end up being very
[SPEAKER_04]: extreme anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from this, we can establish what we
hope is an accurate false discovery rate
[SPEAKER_04]: cutoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing this takes quite a bit of time,
even making some compromises.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are things we know we could be
doing better that we're not, because it
[SPEAKER_04]: still takes about seven years of CPU time
to analyze 32,000 gene models a maze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the results look like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already talked you through.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the top, we have each phenotype stored
here along the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the top, you have the p-values for the
individual phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the second side, you have either the
selected phenotypes or the non-selected
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes for this gene, and then an
overall significance score for the gene as
[SPEAKER_04]: a whole, whether we see a significant
association between these two SNPs in this
[SPEAKER_04]: gene and all the phenotypes measured for
this population.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I think probably came across in the way
I explained this, a lot of the stats I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't understand the details of,
so I want to see whether or not the
[SPEAKER_04]: associations that are identified by this
model make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, we have a couple of ways to
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first is looking at overlap between
the genes that are identified in this
[SPEAKER_04]: population with this set of data in this
method and genes that were identified in
[SPEAKER_04]: different populations using different
methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we're comparing the genes that
were identified by a number of different
[SPEAKER_04]: models in the 282 population to genes that
were identified in the nested association
[SPEAKER_04]: mapping population, which shares some of
the same haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a larger population with different
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to Ed yesterday, and there may be
some problems with this analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to work on some other ways
to validate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in principle, anyway, if we have more
accuracy, we should see more overlap
[SPEAKER_04]: between the genes we identify in our
population and the genes identified in a
[SPEAKER_04]: different population for some of the same
phenotypes than the genes identified by
[SPEAKER_04]: conventional algorithms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see here, we have some data on
version two of the maize genome and some
[SPEAKER_04]: in version four, so we're constrained to
only the genes that actually have
[SPEAKER_04]: one-to-one correspondence between the two
versions of the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 14% of those genes were identified
as linked to phenotypes in the nested
[SPEAKER_04]: association mapping population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can look at the subsets of genes
identified by different GWAS algorithms,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they are enriched.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the genes identified in the 282
association population are more likely to
[SPEAKER_04]: also have been identified in the nested
association mapping population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this phenome-wide analysis that
my students, in fact, came up with,
[SPEAKER_04]: we see a substantially higher overlap that
is significantly higher than the overlaps
[SPEAKER_04]: seen with any of the conventional GWAS
methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the internal control here,
so this is multiple SNP single trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is utilizing multiple markers within
the gene, but not trying to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: selection and picking a subset of traits
to test together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also look at the kinds of genes
that are being identified by the GPWAS
[SPEAKER_04]: model compared to conventional GWAS.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're seeing here is a Go enrichment
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when identifying essentially the same
number of genes, we see much more
[SPEAKER_04]: enrichment of a wide range of enrichment
and purification of Go terms in the GPWAS
[SPEAKER_04]: gene set relative to genes identified by
GWAS on the same underlying phenotypic and
[SPEAKER_04]: genotypic data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to go into this too much,
but I'm just going to assert that this
[SPEAKER_04]: demonstrates that we at least are
identifying a less random subset of the
[SPEAKER_04]: genome, which could be a good or a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also look at the specific
phenotypes that are being identified as
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with individual genes that have
been characterized through four genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an example of ANT301,
which is a classical mutant that was
[SPEAKER_04]: cloned back in, I think, 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know a lot about phenotypes that are
the mutants of this gene exhibit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know the phenotypes that were
identified as associated with it based on
[SPEAKER_04]: the GPWAS model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these match up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of them, but a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that gives us some sort of qualitative
degree of confidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that I think is most exciting
about the genes identified by this method,
[SPEAKER_04]: though, is not any of these, but the ways
that they are different from the average
[SPEAKER_04]: gene in the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to compare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have all the genes, our
conventional GPWAS genes, and another
[SPEAKER_04]: control, which are a set of these
classical mutants, which, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: are those genes that somebody walked
through a field and said, that phenotype
[SPEAKER_04]: is so interesting, I need to clone it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see that if we just look at it
having an average expression level higher
[SPEAKER_04]: than a single FPKM, all of these sets are
much more likely to be expressed at levels
[SPEAKER_04]: above background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the overall set of gene models in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we look at KAKS, so a measure of how
effectively purifying selection is
[SPEAKER_04]: operating on these, we can only do this
with a subset of genes that are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: conserved and sorted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see that both the classical mutants and
the GPWAS genes have a statistically
[SPEAKER_04]: significant shift of distribution towards
lower KAKS ratios, which indicates that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're subject to stronger purifying
selection than the average gene in the
[SPEAKER_04]: genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of other markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you about synthetic conservation,
which is almost all of the classical
[SPEAKER_04]: mutants are these synthetically conserved
genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this particular set, about 94 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also see a substantial enrichment both
for genes identified by conventional GWAS
[SPEAKER_04]: and by GPWAS relative to the background
set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And conversely, in Mays, there are a lot
of genes that exhibit presence-absence
[SPEAKER_04]: variations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're in B73, say, but they're absent
from other genetic backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that while this is quite common
for the genes set as a whole, it is much
[SPEAKER_04]: rarer for genes identified with
quantitative genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And GPWAS is closer to the really low
level that we see for classical mutants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any quantitative genetics approach to
identifying genes that are associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: genotype identifies genes that look more
like classical mutants than the overall
[SPEAKER_04]: population of gene models.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the approach that CHI is using seems
to identify a population that looks even
[SPEAKER_04]: more like those classical mutants than
conventional GWAS.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to summarize, we're identifying this
population of genes that we think are
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with phenotypic variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more broadly expressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more conserved at the same
positions across species, less likely to
[SPEAKER_04]: exhibit presence-absence variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also tend to be longer genes,
which we see also for the classical
[SPEAKER_04]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can take this figure that I
showed you at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_04]: presentation, and we can calculate
essentially a gene function score,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is just the inverse of that
principal component 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a score over here means you look more
like a classical mutant.
[SPEAKER_04]: A score over here means you look more like
the gene models that don't look like
[SPEAKER_04]: classical mutants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the distribution of all the
gene models of the genome has a large peak
[SPEAKER_04]: over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both the classical mutants and the
GPWAS genes exhibit similar distributions
[SPEAKER_04]: shifted towards this end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the beginning of this talk,
I told you that I think we can do a much
[SPEAKER_04]: better job of deciding which gene models
represent hypotheses that likely are
[SPEAKER_04]: valid, that they likely do explain
something about how the genome determines
[SPEAKER_04]: the characteristics of an organism,
and which gene models are much less likely
[SPEAKER_04]: to play a significant role in determining
phenotype as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I have some students who are
working on doing much better jobs of this
[SPEAKER_04]: prediction than what I have right now,
I hope that these students do such a thing
[SPEAKER_04]: as possible, that we really can look at
gene models and do a better job of saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, these probably are interesting
and worthy of a lot more study.
[SPEAKER_04]: These probably we don't want to burn out
Brad's students trying to find a
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I would like to thank my
wonderful lab, my colleagues, both
[SPEAKER_04]: engineering, statistics, and biology,
and all of you for your attention here
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start off with one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a bias for cloning genes they've
already been cloned at price or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: or other species out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means I don't have a perfect
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say because we're using primarily
genes that were identified prior to 2011,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the benefit of being cloned in
rice was much smaller, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: that happened before we had a maize genome
to compare to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a student working on getting the
2011 to 2019 genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would predict we'd see a bigger effect
of already having a characterized function
[SPEAKER_04]: in rice or another grass in that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could essentially just add that in
the model too.
[SPEAKER_03]: When cloned in rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I worked on a project with a PhD where
I found that genes that are highly
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in the Poetius species,
and we compared their analysis across four
[SPEAKER_02]: Poetius species on the genes that are
highly expressed, also tend to be broadly
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed, and the AKSs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this model, we're trying to predict
when gene models are known by some
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to tease apart the effects of
these correlated characters.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go back to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was that you've observed a
lot of correlation already between the
[SPEAKER_04]: average level of expression, the breadth
of expression across many different
[SPEAKER_04]: tissues, the KAKS, which was not in this
particular model because we only had it
[SPEAKER_04]: for synthetically conserved genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we certainly see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the things I like about
being able to visualize the data this way
[SPEAKER_04]: is we do see a lot of these do seem to
show up similarly when we project them
[SPEAKER_04]: into the PCA space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there are some genes,
though, we see that do have very high
[SPEAKER_04]: expression that are not evolutionarily
conserved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being able to pull out some of the
categories that are exceptions to the
[SPEAKER_04]: overall trend and look at those would be
very interesting in terms of figuring out
[SPEAKER_04]: whether the reason a lot of these are
showing up is that they're all correlated,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, with expression, or whether they have
separate predictive power.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be interested to find out the
answer and share it with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the non-parametric regression
models, how sensitive are those methods to
sparse data?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can configure how flexible it's going
to be with individual data points.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I really like about it,
though, is it does tolerate uneven data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we have dense sampling in some parts
and much less dense in other parts,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're still able to fit reasonably good
curves.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the points I didn't talk about a
lot with this is the way that the images
[SPEAKER_04]: are collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually can grow twice as many plants
as it can be photographed in a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only reason we're able to make this
comparison is because we're able to use
[SPEAKER_04]: the non-parametric regression to fill in
the values so that we can look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole population at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the counting leaves of the sort
of plants and simulating the images,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the difference between making up a
computer and corn and then just taking
[SPEAKER_03]: more pictures of the same plants you have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because maybe counting leaves is simple
enough for not overfitting, but I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, why would you just take more
pictures of the same plants you already
[SPEAKER_03]: have to put your training model?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the simulating.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about just taking photos
from more angles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The simulating plant seems odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: It uses a training model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it helps train the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious what that difference
would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a number of data augmentation
approaches you can use with real images.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can mirror the image and do adding
noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we would rapidly hit a point
of emission return in terms of the number
[SPEAKER_04]: of different angles you can photograph the
plant from and still get noticeably
[SPEAKER_04]: different images.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I like about the simulated
approach, and I haven't shown that this is
[SPEAKER_04]: the case, is that in principle we're
sampling a really wide parameter space in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of what a corn plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some ways that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to jump all the way back
to that slide, but one of the issues we
[SPEAKER_04]: had is we don't actually have an
alternating phylotaxi in the simulated
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who made the corn plant model for
video games, I don't think realized that
[SPEAKER_04]: that was what corn plants did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could do more work to converge on a
biologically informed 3D model.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bigger challenge, and it's not such an
issue for leaf counting, is you also need
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you don't just need the photos,
you need the ground truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for a lot of sort of complex
structural traits, it can be very
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging to collect the ground truth
from large numbers of real plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the full 3D model of the corn
plant, you already know all the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just the collecting images,
but collecting the ground truth where you
[SPEAKER_04]: save effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are about 100 genes, and so these
are ones that were identified first by
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype, and then somebody actually
cloned it that way, rather than either
[SPEAKER_04]: just a statistical association between the
gene and phenotype, or reverse genetics of
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody said, hey, this gene looks
interesting, let's knock it out,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then try really hard to find a
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been concentrating a lot on the
morphological phenotypes?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe much of this then pertains to
those, because historically that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: people mapped in those genes that were
cloned first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about when you start looking at
physiological traits and things that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't morphologically observable in this
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that shift the entire gene space
that you're working with?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned, certainly for the
disease resistance genes, those behave so
[SPEAKER_04]: differently from everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the stuff involved in
physiology or biochemistry that isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: reflected in morphology, I'm not sure I
could make a good prediction right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the great thing is we're getting those
data sets more and more every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very soon, I'm confident I would have
an answer on whether they would behave the
[SPEAKER_04]: same as the genes controlling
morphological traits, or if they show very
[SPEAKER_04]: different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm trying to think about the
transcription factors that do such
[SPEAKER_00]: different things in different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, my take home is a lot of what
is regulated and at least the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been interested in are regulated by
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're A, expressed often at very low
levels, and B, very specific kinds in
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues, and C, they affect the kinds of
phenotypes we're interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the same transcription factor does
completely opposite things or different
[SPEAKER_00]: things in different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm just trying to...
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach into the gene space that I'm
interested in, that I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the data sets are out there,
so I need to get you an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like your models that separate
leaves from stalks from chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those results look really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering whether the weights for
those models, as is, generalize well to
[SPEAKER_01]: other grasses that you have similar data
sets for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's one of the things on
Shenyang's to-do list is to run this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have chromolitanase data and see
whether it's translatable or if we need a
[SPEAKER_04]: new training set for each species we work
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do work very well across the 400
sorghum genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least it's not genotype specific,
which is always the problem with a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why don't we wrap it up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your time.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
