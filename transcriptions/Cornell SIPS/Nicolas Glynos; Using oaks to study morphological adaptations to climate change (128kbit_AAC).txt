[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick did his work in Kevin Reeson's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went to his hometown in Kansas City,
Missouri.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick will actually graduate next December.
[SPEAKER_03]: He keeps apologizing for not having all of
his data, but as you'll see, it's a very
[SPEAKER_03]: impressive data set he's already got in
great experimental design.
[SPEAKER_03]: After graduation next December,
he plans to work until about August where
[SPEAKER_03]: he'll start a PhD program which he'll
apply for next fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Nick and this is a project that
I've been working on for about the past
[SPEAKER_00]: year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mike said, I'm going to continue to
work on it over the summer and in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of my honors thesis here and
I've been working on it with Kevin Nixon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mike mentioned, I am still in the
process of continuing on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically just a status update of
where I am and where I plan to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a quick outline, today I'm going to
talk about just an introduction and the
[SPEAKER_00]: goals of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to do and how we plan to
do that and then some of the methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to and that we have been using
over the last year and how those methods
[SPEAKER_00]: are aligning with some of the methods that
have been used in the past and maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: new things as well that haven't been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll also mention some of the results
that we expect to get and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: future work over the summer and the next
semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an introduction, it's important to note
that there has been a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation between leaf shape and climate
for several decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecologists and botanists have noticed that
leaves that are, for example, thin and
[SPEAKER_00]: highly dissected or highly toothed,
have highly toothed margins are more often
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the northern, more temperate
regions of the United States or of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves that are thicker and with entire
margins are often found in wetter,
[SPEAKER_00]: more tropical climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, leaves that are much smaller,
thicker, and maybe are more spiny are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in dry climates and desert habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several hypotheses that can tell
us why leaves are shaped this way and the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations that go along with climate
and the morphological variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the previous work has just
focused on these general characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've looked at leaf shape and maybe
deciduous versus evergreen
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this project, we plan to look at some
characteristics that are going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more specific and maybe tell us
a little bit more about the adaptations
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaves have to climate and maybe
allow us to make some hypotheses about why
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are shaped the way they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inspiration for this project came from
a pretty simple question, and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: are oak leaves shaped so differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any experience with oak
taxonomy or oak morphology, then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that there's a huge variation in
the shape of their leaves, the habitats
[SPEAKER_00]: they occupy, and their lifestyle as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to try to answer that question,
and in doing that, we hope to achieve a
[SPEAKER_00]: few goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first goal is to determine the leaf
characteristics in oak leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: most adapted to certain climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make some really specific and
precise measurements to be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses about why leaves are shaped the
way they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, correlate that to the specific
climates they occupy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also develop methods that can be
used for other morphological studies and
[SPEAKER_00]: other taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a lot of digital
morphological measurements that can
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully be not only used for oaks,
but maybe other taxa in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then can also be applied to things
like niche modeling or taxonomic purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can better understand how
morphology relates to adaptation and
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can also use these correlations
that we find to improve our predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: about paleo climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we know that the flora of
a certain area has leaf characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain type, then we can look at a
fossil flora and make correlations between
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves that we see today and the
climates they inhabit and the paleo
[SPEAKER_00]: climates of the time of those fossil
flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we choose oaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've got a really immense and
diverse morphological, geographical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and habitat preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, they are extremely
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 400 species of oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They range from enormous deciduous trees
to evergreen rhizomatous shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have habitats ranging from northern
temperate climates into the subtropics and
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their leaf morphology is equally as
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at variations in leaf size from
some of the extremes here over to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller leaves here, leaf shape,
there's lobed margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see entire margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see deeper lobed margins with many
spines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variation is really immense that you
see in oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no surprise that they also have
really broad geographical distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see them from southern Canada all
the way into the subtropics and tropics of
[SPEAKER_00]: northern South America and also from coast
to coast in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a testament to the diversity
of habitats that they occupy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find them in temperate,
cooler regions in the north, drier regions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the southwest, and wet, even cloud
forest regions in the subtropics and
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on their diverse morphology,
their wide geographical distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and their really broad habitat ability to
adapt to different habitats, they make an
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal group to study these correlations
between morphology and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we also happen to
have
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest collection of oaks in the
world at the Herbarium here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a collection of over 230 oak
species and over 13,000 data-based
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions of oak specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really makes it for an ideal group to
study to work on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: On to some of the methods and how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I plan to look for these correlations
and measure these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a lot of the work that I've been
talking about with basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using an herbarium specimen, we can take a
look at the label and get collection
[SPEAKER_00]: information on where that specimen was
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pinpoint that on a map with a
latitude and longitude coordinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have latitude and longitude
coordinates for the entire species of our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection, then we can map those map all
of the species onto a map and produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: range map of that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can take the specific coordinate
for the specimen of interest and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the specific climatic conditions
that that specimen was in when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can go back to the original
specimen and take a look at the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and make some really
detailed and precise morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting all these things together,
then we're able to take geography,
[SPEAKER_00]: climate, and morphology and put that into
one framework that we can be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: for comparisons and to be able to make
hypotheses about how these leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: adapting and surviving in these different
habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go into a little bit more detail,
to do the geo-referencing, we're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: software called GeoLocate that was
produced by Tulane University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, like I said, just taking
information right off that herbarium label
[SPEAKER_00]: and typing that right into this software
interface in the GeoLocate software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you can get a pretty accurate
estimation of where that specimen was
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this one says, I don't know
if you can read it, but it's San
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernardino National Forest near Route 38.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point comes really near to that string
that you typed in and it prints out a
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude and longitude coordinate for you
to automatically apply to that specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be some
uncertainty with the collection
[SPEAKER_00]: information on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, sometimes the collector will
write 10 miles west of Sedona.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, you don't have much precision
and you've got to make a pretty broad
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation about where that specimen was
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to our collection in the
herbarium, we can also use GBIF,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an online database of nearly two
million species and I think over 700
[SPEAKER_00]: million individual specimens that have
been geo-referenced and data based in a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar way as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can mine that data and be able to
compare that to the data that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting in the herbarium and also to
field studies that I'll be doing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eliminate the uncertainty with some of
the geo-referencing, the best way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that is to go and make field collections
with precise geographical coordinates and
[SPEAKER_00]: better collection information on the
specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be done this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To access climate data, we're going to be
using World Climb, which is the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest global climate database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains over 40,000 weather stations
across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these red dots on the map
represents a individual weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This database produces an interpolated
continuous grid of climate data such that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can input any latitude, longitude
coordinate and get a unique climate
[SPEAKER_00]: profile for that latitude, longitude
coordinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of climatic variables
that are presented in this database,
[SPEAKER_00]: including variables on precipitation,
temperature and several other different
[SPEAKER_00]: variables as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do morphological measurements,
we're going to be using the online
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium database that we have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of what the page
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is several different specimens of one
specific species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go ahead and choose one species
and embed it right into this into the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium database website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have implemented a system of
morphological measurements so that we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the database, be able to measure
things like petiole length, leaf length,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf width, distance to the widest point,
perimeter of the leaf, surface area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can count the number of primary and
secondary veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure vein angle and you can
count and measure the depth and degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: spining and lobing on all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really going to make the
morphological measurement process
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely efficient and quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, it's going to allow us to
have a digital paper trail of every single
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement that we make such that every
measurement will be instantly updated and
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated to that specimen and locked to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we need to go back and modify
measurements or review the measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: that we made, we can always do that
because this measurement system is
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded in the herbarium database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to have that all connected
and correlated at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big jump or a big change from
the previous ways of just measuring leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: with a ruler or with old instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we collect a lot of the data,
then we'll have a large matrix that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes several different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones I've been working with
recently and they're mostly western oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers beside them indicate the
number of specimens we have data-based and
[SPEAKER_00]: imaged in the herbarium right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I mentioned, we'll have several
different morphological characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll measure as well and a host of
climatic variables that will be correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: to each individual specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can go ahead and attempt to make
correlations and do some analyses between
[SPEAKER_00]: the different species, which we'll look at
some of the different adaptations and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the different characteristics of these
species that are allowing them to adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: and occupy different habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also look at variation within
species that will maybe tell us something
[SPEAKER_00]: about phenotypic plasticity and some of
the variation that we see in individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can take the whole matrix and look
at variation across space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at how these things vary with
geography and over time as well because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a collection that ranges in the
herbarium of over 150 years of collections
[SPEAKER_00]: of specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to do all these will hopefully
lead to some conclusions that will support
[SPEAKER_00]: our hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expected results that we hope to see
here, definitely we want to see some type
[SPEAKER_00]: of correlation between morphology and
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of, like I mentioned,
a lot of correlations in the past that
[SPEAKER_00]: have made between lobing and toothing of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to come up with something that's a
little bit more specific and maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more applicable to oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also hope to improve the
phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phylogeny of oaks is notoriously
unresolved and very difficult to interpret
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a large degree of phenotypic
plasticity and hybridization within the
[SPEAKER_00]: genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to make these precise and
efficient morphological measurements may
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the phylogeny and taxonomy of the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also hope to maybe improve niche
modeling methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niche modeling in the past has basically
just used geographic distributions of
[SPEAKER_00]: species to estimate the ranges of where
those species' habitats are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can implement morphological
characteristics that correlate with
[SPEAKER_00]: climate into those niche models,
we may be able to better understand why
[SPEAKER_00]: and how some species adapt to certain
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, a big portion of this
summer is going to be devoted to a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting trip across the southwestern U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: into California and up into the northwest
to document, collect, and photograph
[SPEAKER_00]: several different oak species to not only
make comparisons to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: geo-referencing and the already collected
specimens that we have, but also to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the data set and add to the
herbarium collection that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing that, I'm going to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prototype plant press that I
hope to help out with the collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling it the plexi press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically two sheets of
plexiglass that you can carry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be light and easy and it'll allow
imaging and it'll be a lot easier to
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be uploaded to the herbarium
website and measurements can be made
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we can also hopefully
improve the morphological measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: interface so that we can make better and
more precise measurements as we go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To wrap up, I've got to have a big thanks
to Kevin Nixon, who is my research
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor, who supported me a lot throughout
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to Anna and Peter in the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been a huge help throughout the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to the plant science committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaina, Chris and Mike for helping out
with presentation and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two undergraduate research grants that are
going to support the summer collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely co-occur in this area,
but they may have ranges that differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find that chestnut oak has a range
that's not the same as a white oak or a
[SPEAKER_00]: red oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can use collections from across that
range and be able to correlate those
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics to different areas and we
can maybe come up with better hypotheses
[SPEAKER_00]: about why they have the shapes they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypic plasticity is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be better to look at phenotypic
plasticity within given species so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the species constraint rather
than the problem of the environment we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about where you have overlapping
ranges but there's a genetic component to
[SPEAKER_02]: different morphology rather than a
physiological adaptation of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I think is possible
with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we're going to have such a
large sample size for each species will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow us to do that within species
comparison and among species comparison.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say yes and especially so with oaks,
even more so with oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look on one oak branch and see
leaves that have really distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the field this summer that's going to
be hopefully avoided by making collections
[SPEAKER_00]: that are standard with methodology that's
standard along each specimen and
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's maybe the ultimate goal is
to get everything automated just so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take a picture of a leaf or take a
picture of a thousand leaves and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: through an automated system to come up
with all these morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and I think that yeah that
would be the ultimate goal but for now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just done by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
