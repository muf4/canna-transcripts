[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much, Neil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about everything I
did in the last 40 years, because it would
[SPEAKER_01]: take about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talked to Neil about possibly doing
this, we thought it might be interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a little more philosophical type
of approach, rather than just showing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of data, and talk about over a career
what some of the lessons are that you
[SPEAKER_01]: learned, that you wish you knew at the
beginning of your career.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the latter part's going to be sort
of miscellaneous observations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but hopefully they might be of some use to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, when you get started on
doing research, one of the questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't sort of ask ourselves implicitly,
but we actually do, is, so how am I going
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of approach should I use for
research?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard a talk from Saki Pretorius
from the Australian Hawaiian Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute, and he showed this example of
different types of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little matrix with research
inspired by fundamental understanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether yes or no, and then research
inspired utility by utility or
[SPEAKER_01]: application, yes or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at these, of course you
got four quadrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called one of them Bohr's, after Neil's
Bohr, the physicist, where it's pursuit of
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental understanding alone without
any immediate application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically basic research,
which is fine, and is something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kitty Corner from that is the Edison's
quadrant, which is pursuit of practical
[SPEAKER_01]: utility, but not necessarily with an
understanding in mind, but a trial and
[SPEAKER_01]: error approach, which has also been very
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he felt, and I agree, that probably
the most useful approach is what he called
[SPEAKER_01]: Pasteur's approach, and that is integrated
approach for fundamental understanding and
[SPEAKER_01]: practical utility together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can do both of those and
integrate them, then I think that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: preferable way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you want to avoid the Joker's
quadrant of no value in either direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from Saki's paper, he basically said
that the Pasteurian research is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: needed towards increasing fundamental
understanding in, I think the important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, in a context responsive to applied
needs at levels of both problem selection
[SPEAKER_01]: and experimental design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for us, I think this fits the
horticulture and the horticultural area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can learn the fundamental
understanding, but if it's in the context
[SPEAKER_01]: of a real problem, I think we gain in both
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, usually if you have that
type of approach, you're going to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the physiological principle
behind things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Emerson had a nice quote that I
think summed it up nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The value of a principle is in the number
of things it will explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another way of looking at it is that
if you have a system where, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental responses of plants,
that if you have a physiological principle
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant here in the middle,
it will interact with different
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the weather A might be a one year,
weather B might be a different year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interaction between the physiological
principle and the environment will give an
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in one year it might be dry and you'll
get a certain outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another year it might be wet and
you'll get a different outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the outcomes will vary along with the
inputs, but the physiological principle
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can understand that,
you're going to be much better at being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to predict what's going to happen or
explain what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, if we do field trials,
in different years we get different
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't always make a lot of
sense unless you understand the principle
[SPEAKER_01]: that is interacting and you're giving a
different manifestation of that final
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I really tried to focus on
understanding what the physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: principles are behind the growth and
development and performance of primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes and apples that I've worked with
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my research goals really has been
to understand the environmental and
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological limitations to both the
basic biological as well as economic
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity of grapes and tree fruits,
especially apples, but also to utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: that information collaboratively with
colleagues like Terrence Robinson and
[SPEAKER_01]: others to use that information to improve
productivity or performance or the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, sustainability of our tree
performance and the cultural practices
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm emphasizing primarily light or
energy, carbon and water relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to integrate those with
information like from Lai Leng Cheng on
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition and other disciplines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the area that I'm focusing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, instead of going through all the
details, I thought I'd give maybe three
[SPEAKER_01]: examples of some work that started out
asking fundamental questions and ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: giving some practical outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is about, I was wondering
about apple trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much dry matter do they produce over
the season?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really controlling that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can New Zealand produce twice the
fruit that we can?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really controlling the productivity
from a carbon standpoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because of that study over the
years, we gradually developed a simulation
[SPEAKER_01]: model that I'll talk about that has
actually become useful for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is in terms of water use by
apples and the need for potential
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to really understand how much
does the apple tree use because it has
[SPEAKER_01]: some unusual characteristics and what
controls it under our type of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that eventually led to an
apple-specific Penman-Monteith equation
[SPEAKER_01]: for water use that is now being used by
growers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, a nagging question with
water relations over the years is how can
[SPEAKER_01]: we try to measure and continuously monitor
the water relations of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perennial plants are particularly dynamic
in their water relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's so dynamic that just taking a
reading once a week isn't going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a very good overall view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked into that and how we can
possibly do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the sensor that Vinay has been
working on is an example of the outcome of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me try to run through these.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the carbon balance area, some of the
more specific questions beyond just how
[SPEAKER_01]: much dry matter does an apple tree produce
in the season, we're interested in what
[SPEAKER_01]: are the dynamic patterns over the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during those different patterns,
because not everything is, the demand of
[SPEAKER_01]: supply doesn't always stay exactly in
balance, are there key periods where there
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a carbon deficit and is there
anything we could do about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we took a lot of field
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down in the lower left corner,
you can see we've used the whole canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: balloon chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, in some cases, had as many as 45
days during a season that we measured
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've done a lot of single leaf and
fruit development measurements,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of spot measurements over the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'd like to try to integrate those
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up developing a simulation
model, which I'll show next, about the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon balance of apples with malisim or
vidisim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vidisim is the great version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found over the years that it was
very important to go iteratively between
[SPEAKER_01]: the measurements and the modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the modeling helps you integrate
the measurements, but then you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: get some wild values if you're not always
checking against real measurements with
[SPEAKER_01]: the modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that modeling and measurement
really fit together well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I was far better off doing
both of them rather than one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't go through all of it,
but this is basically a carbon balance
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to look for the carbon
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that depends on the
sunlight available and what's intercepted
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaf photosynthesis to convert it into
dry matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, many of the things around
the outside are factors that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: influence those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we looked at the total demand of
respiration and growth of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this gives a general carbon
supply demand balance, which we found very
[SPEAKER_01]: useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have components for fruit drop
and partitioning, which we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have time to go into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's as simplified a model as
possible, although it still ends up being
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively complex to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to put it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did, to take a look at what was
going on, we could estimate that the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply in the blue here initially dips
because of reserves being used up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is current supply, current
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then peaks in the middle of season and
then gradually drops off with the shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: days and less radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the demands, these more solid lines,
are the general demand curves for a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: crop of fruit and then a heavier crop
being, so there is some carbon deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: during a good part of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with apples, since you have 10 to 20
times more flowers producing initial fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: than you actually want to take to harvest,
if all those fruit stayed on, the demand
[SPEAKER_01]: curve is this purple one, this initial
crop that just skyrockets and goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a tree might have 2,000 fruit and
you want 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those 2,000 fruit really take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in a couple weeks
after bloom, a week to three weeks after
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom is where you get a really dramatic
carbon deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's right at a time during
natural fruit drop and then also during
[SPEAKER_01]: the response to chemical thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of gave us a hint something,
there was a physiological basis for some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using these types of simulations,
not trying to be too precise but looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at general patterns and see when maybe
supply and demand might be in balance or
[SPEAKER_01]: might be out of balance was very helpful
to focus our research right into that time
[SPEAKER_01]: period where there's normally a tendency
to have equally spaced readings over a
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last probably the last 10 or 15
years, I've almost never taken any
[SPEAKER_01]: readings after a month after bloom because
I know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the action really is occurring early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do follow up with some readings
later, but the action is occurring at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the model helped us really identify
this and so help focus our research to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also turned out at that time,
if you measure a lot of fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: we measured the fruit growth of probably
10 or 12,000 fruits over the years during
[SPEAKER_01]: that post bloom period, what we find is
that the general pattern is that if the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruits are growing at a high rate,
usually something like 60 or 70% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum rate that you would have at that
time under those conditions, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the fruit stopped growing or slow their
growth dramatically, they're going to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be 10, 14 days later before
they actually fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can tell by monitoring the fruit,
usually within three or four days,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're very careful, within three or
four days after say a chemical thinner or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a really shady or low light period,
we can tell which ones are going to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: off maybe 10 days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to be retained, they have to
continue growth, continue at a high growth
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we make it as a fraction of the
fastest growing fruit because if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: colder, everything's going to grow
somewhat slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the absolute rate isn't so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have incorporated this into the
model for a drop of fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what's occurring at that time
when you have a carbon deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working with Terence, we're saying,
well, we have some years that we get a big
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy drop, natural drop, and we get a
strong response to chemical thinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other years, we put the same thinner on,
same time, same stage of development,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get very little drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemical thinning has been very,
very erratic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers know that if you go out and do
exactly the same thing, put on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical, same time, same stage,
same orchard, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: different results every year, which is
sort of like the definition of insanity,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the same thing over and over but
expecting different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought, well, let's try to bring
some sanity to this and see if the model
[SPEAKER_01]: might be able to help us understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started looking to see whether the
model might help us understand natural
[SPEAKER_01]: drop, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was an example from in Uruguay
when I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to be there right about the
time that there was a lot of fruit drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally, apples will drop at a much
smaller size than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were having fruit that were,
some of them were up to 24 millimeters in
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a heavy initial set, and they
just kept growing and growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a huge drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, the industry lost about 30%
of its normal, it was 70% of normal crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it occurred just before all the hand
thinning that was supposed to be done by
[SPEAKER_01]: 50,000 workers there who all of a sudden
were out of a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at the, we ran their
weather data through the carbon balance
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was that this early
initial critical time, the, in blue here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see the circle that we had
abnormally good carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have that, we see that the
fruit don't fall off because they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: able to continue growing, or a much
greater proportion can continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up having a lot of quite large
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they had five really cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't particularly hot or anything,
but they were just very cloudy days that
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't really think much about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was a cloudy week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, it was very cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the carbon deficit just went really
through the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find in this orange band here,
this is roughly sort of our threshold for
[SPEAKER_01]: having a strong effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can bounce around above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it goes below that, you're gonna
probably see a strong reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this occurred right about the time
these were just really having a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have five or six days of
really reduced growth, then you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have a huge drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked like it can help explain
natural drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so then, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was somewhere in the 30 to 40%
of normal radiation, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: abnormal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I mean, we'll see that overcast,
you know, fairly heavy overcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real key was that it was like five
days in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one day doesn't really do much to
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days, you really have a strong
effect and more, even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked like natural drop could
relate to the carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Terence had been doing some
studies where he was putting on chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: thinners exactly the same concentration,
but about every four days on an orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the same trees, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wanted to see what the timing was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would find that one year,
the best thinning occurred maybe the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week after bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one, it would be three weeks after
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one, two weeks after bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really erratic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't specifically guess as to when
it was going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had this data on timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he started looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got many different years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is an example where the zero line
means the carbon is in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything above is excess and below is
deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So found that everything was pretty much
in balance until we got hit about 17 to 20
[SPEAKER_01]: days after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some, it was warm and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had another big dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we found that when we put the
thinner on at that time, we've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's been observed many times by
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know if it's warm and cloudy,
you're going to have a strong thinner
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did seem to correlate with the
carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've tested this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way we're using this,
I didn't really put the R there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but thanks Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any case, the way we're using this model
is we're using it similar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Penman-Monteith equation for
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have a standard reference plant,
like their standard grass, which the
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters are set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you put in the weather for
different years or different periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see what does the weather
do to that standard plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the basis of a lot of the
estimation of evapotranspiration that is
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're basically doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the apple model and having a standard
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can put in weather from
different climates and different years or
[SPEAKER_01]: different treatments, if you put a shade
on, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can see what that would do to,
say, a carbon reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Terence started using this for
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before he went out to speak to the growers
right at the beginning of thinning,
[SPEAKER_01]: he would run the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would look for something like
a very strong deficit here in the circle
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bottom here, where it looked like
it was going to be a significant deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: during that sensitive period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was able to warn some of the
growers that there was a severe deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful about maybe using the same
normal concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps reduce the concentration of
thinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, that turned out that
it was very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the growers had become much more
confident about their thinning using this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people from all over the world are
testing this now and working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the New York growers, we worked
with the Climate Center with Art DiGottano
[SPEAKER_01]: and Keith Eggleston.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put the climate center into a
carbon balance model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We translated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Myers, one of our ex-students,
Justine's postdoc, some of his time was,
[SPEAKER_01]: we purchased to translate the model into
an Excel version and then also into Python
[SPEAKER_01]: for an online version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do now is the grower can go
in, select their weather station from the
[SPEAKER_01]: automated weather stations, and put in
information on when the trees begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow to start the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the output shows it only needs
maximum and minimum temperatures and solar
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation for each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a daily time step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the data there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gives the production and
demand and the carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a four-day running average
because the tree buffers out like one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a buffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Terrence has developed thinning
recommendations based on what type of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon deficit we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is being used currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have growers and consultants that
actually have the model themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: have been running them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the growers was reporting that
he was able to reduce his post-thinning,
[SPEAKER_01]: hand-thinning bill because he normally
wasn't comfortable with the chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he always used a little less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always had too many fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he had to pay for extra
hand-thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had reduced his hand-thinning from
about $100,000 a year down to about
[SPEAKER_01]: $20,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a critical time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an important process to get that
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have collaborators in many
different countries that are working with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to develop this further and
have a website that others from around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world can input their own weather data
directly and then have it run the
[SPEAKER_01]: simulation model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one that we began with the
model in 1988.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an overnight process, as you can
tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gradually, you have to keep plugging
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is about the area of how much
water do apple trees need and use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And factors that control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the observations that sort of
led to the development here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that a long time ago, 1980 or so,
I was working with a colleague in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that the stomates of apples
seemed to have an unusual response to
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the field, in the greenhouse or
growth chamber, it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the field, they don't seem to be
very sensitive to the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really controlled by the
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're highly coupled to the
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this tied together with
Terrence's observations from irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: trials that if he used the normal thing
using that Penma Montith ET reference and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a fraction of that, the crop
coefficient for estimating apple water
[SPEAKER_01]: use, in some years, we were greatly
over-irrigating, even though we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to figure out,
well, why aren't the trees using as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as we expected?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's see if we could put this
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a student, Danilo Dragone, about 10
years ago or so, came, worked with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a microclimatologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really didn't know much about
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure he learned a huge amount
about horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did some really good work for us on
understanding what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he did a lot of measurements,
again, using sap flow gauges in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we calibrated them with the balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it went through the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop coefficient is the fraction of
that reference that's actually used.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we would find is from day to day,
we would see it might be up to 90% or 96%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in other days, it would be down to
like 45%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge variations from day to day that
we're trying to figure out what actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be fairly constant
because the reference is supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust to the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought, well, shockingly,
grass is maybe not a good model of an
[SPEAKER_01]: apple tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought, well, maybe we need to back
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than using a wrong model and
then taking a fraction of a wrong model,
[SPEAKER_01]: we might be better off just taking the
original Penman-Monteith equation of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the physics and then making our own
apple-specific version of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Danilo did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take credit, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this model response curve here turns
out that in very dry conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stomates do close due to a high
evaporative demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But under moderately dry, all the way to
very humid conditions, it doesn't respond
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore to the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we use the Penman-Monteith equation,
we had to put in a very different boundary
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of air because an apple orchard is
very, very, a lot of turbulent flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have that still air like you
do over grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to adjust because the
trees don't always intercept 100% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light, like a grass would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly, or finally,
we had to put in this unusual stomatal
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did, we got a very,
very good model that fit the data very
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from that, then we've, again,
gone back to work with Art and Keith and
[SPEAKER_01]: have an apple ET.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the T model specific, it turns out that
humid conditions are the situation where
[SPEAKER_01]: that traditional system doesn't work very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the growers can choose their own
location, and the data is put in directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the model calculates the
estimated water use and a water balance
[SPEAKER_01]: for the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the output from that chosen for
the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or say, Williamson in this particular
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the growers can put in their spacing
and descriptions of the orchard so it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be adjusted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a young orchard, it'll be smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, again, just studying how stomates
respond to humidity has eventually led to
[SPEAKER_01]: a useful tool which is online for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another final one that I wanna
talk about a bit is that when you work
[SPEAKER_01]: with apple and grapes and tree fruits and
forest trees also, one of the real issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with understanding the water stress in
these types of systems, well, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: really two issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that the roots of these different
types of perennial plants tend to be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: erratic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be very uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is grape roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from South Africa, couple of
pictures here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in a very, very uniform friable
soil, about four feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the roots distribute
rather nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially grape roots, they don't
have any inherent structure just the way
[SPEAKER_01]: the top doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will go wherever the conditions
are best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, if you happen to have
a plow pan like here or a hard plan or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a perch water table and things like
that, those root systems will go wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: the conditions are best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really predict that very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've dug up a lot of grape roots and
you just don't know where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, then trying on a deep
erratic root system, where do you put your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil moisture sensor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you use soil moisture,
you're never sure exactly where to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that even things like neutron
probe that take a big sample only very
[SPEAKER_01]: generally will respond very well to the
soil moisture and say the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: or the water potential of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may be in different parts of the
soil with different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing is that because of the
hydraulic resistance, especially in apple
[SPEAKER_01]: trees or beaches, things like that,
the hydraulic resistance is fairly high in
[SPEAKER_01]: these types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is that the water
potential in the top of the plant depends
[SPEAKER_01]: not only on the soil, but also on the
evaporative demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have two days with the same soil
moisture, if one of them is a sunny,
[SPEAKER_01]: breezy, warm, dry day, the water potential
might go to minus 20 bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, if it's overcast and humid
and cool, it may only go to seven bars,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though you have exactly the same
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, the importance of the
evaporative demand to these perennials,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like to be able to measure it
directly in the plant rather than trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to indirectly measure it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course we use pressure bombs,
pressure chambers, excuse me, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're having on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go in, but obviously it's sort of
like taking your blood pressure once every
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get an instantaneous reading,
and then the rest of the time it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: going crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on whether you just got a grant
or just got refused.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from a grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your blood pressure and the water
status of these plants is very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a dynamic system,
you want to be able to measure it very
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to try to do a continuous
measurement versus, say, a one-time
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement once a week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like to be able to do something
where we can monitor this continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a fairly large drop in the
water potential during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the water status of the
plant makes a big difference in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and the size of fruit, the quality
of fruit, and especially in wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for flavor development
and wine quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, especially with red
grapes, having an intermediate stress is
[SPEAKER_01]: the optimum, not having too little stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want too much stress and
shut the whole plant down so it can't
[SPEAKER_01]: ripen the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to have an intermediate
stress in a very dynamic situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to have a lot of measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like to be able to make more of a
continuous measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the approach that we use, and this is
in collaboration with Abe Struck,
[SPEAKER_01]: who I think we'll be talking next week,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a microfluidic physics engineer in
chem and biomolecular engineering who's
[SPEAKER_01]: been interested in water and plants and
under tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had an idea and worked with Abe and
developed a design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Vinay has been working for the last,
what, 24 years or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic concept is that we have a
normal tensiometer that's been used with
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it's pulled out of this,
the soil pulls water out and you set up a
[SPEAKER_01]: tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that, of course,
these fail with almost a bar is about the
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum range that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to do this inside a plant,
we need to go to 20 or 30 bars type of
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea here is to take the same
concept of the tensiometer, but make a
[SPEAKER_01]: small chip that actually is a micro
version of the tensiometer, but with the
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny, tiny tubes and the tiny volume in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinay, what's the volume in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than a microliter of water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of these extremely tiny volumes
and all the wall effects, you can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: much greater range than you do in a big
macro tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been working, we started in 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, got to be persistent to have
overnight success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've developed, and this is sort of
the latest version of the micro
[SPEAKER_01]: tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea being that we'll embed that
directly into the wood, the trunk of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vine or the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's electronic, so we have an output
that we can electronically monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also, they're made by using,
it's called microelectromechanical systems
[SPEAKER_01]: or MEMS technology, which is sort of like
chips, integrated circuits, but the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, integrated devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's Vinay and his team in the
Cornell NanoFab facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fashionable bunny suits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's working with a lot of very
expensive equipment, which occasionally
[SPEAKER_01]: works, and making very small devices that
can be produced on wafers by robotic chip
[SPEAKER_01]: type manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are factories, this is actually
one in, it's called Infotonics in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canandaigua, that can do that type of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea being that we can not only
have a sensor that is a very large range,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the maximum we've been able to
calibrate up to, or down to about what,
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 bars tension?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: 320 bars tension is the, so we have about
320 times the range that the macros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tenseometer has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a huge, huge increase in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to, we're working on the
packaging, trying to get this sensor into
[SPEAKER_01]: forms that we can get into soils and into
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the, this is where we're going,
and it looks quite promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gotten a lot of interest,
because there's a good possibility of
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially a great improvement in the
ability to monitor the water stress and
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize the irrigation efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope because of that type of
manufacture with robots and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like chip manufacture reduces price quite
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping the prices can be quite
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then agriculture is a huge user of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can make even a 1% change in
the amount of water use, that can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: very big change in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are three of the types of
projects that I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out just trying to understand the
fundamental behavior of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, but within the context of how plants
are working in the field and how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: managing them, I think is good to be able
to get that information into a usable form
[SPEAKER_01]: for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to just go through just a
bunch of sort of miscellaneous thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and things that I think I've learned
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, these things that seem to have either
have, or potentially will have the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: impact, they dealt with a fundamental
understanding, but within the integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of the plants in the natural
environment, because at least apples and
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes, you put them in a growth chamber,
they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, some things are the same,
but a lot of terms of carbon and water,
[SPEAKER_01]: those sorts of, that's more what I think
of as a quantitative physiology depends a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot on the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where there's other things like say
phenological stage, beginning of ripening
[SPEAKER_01]: of grapes, that's something that will
happen in all different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think studying the plant in the
natural environment and how we manage it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think was important as a context for the
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any particular use in mind,
but I was working on the physiology of an
[SPEAKER_01]: important process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how it was going to work,
but I, you know, I was aware of what the
[SPEAKER_01]: process was and what the problem was in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, that gives a context
that's useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing was that none of those
things were well funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, none of them were,
even the micro sensor, which seems
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious, I think it was 12, I can't
remember, it was the 12th grant proposal
[SPEAKER_01]: that I wrote that actually finally got
funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times these things,
if you're studying stone mates,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody else thinks that, you know,
that's going to be very useful,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least not generally in our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to not be,
you know, if you think it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to find some time, you know,
to work on it, even if you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's much more difficult to say
now, but I think it's still true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team research really is critical if you're
going to work on complex issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many different aspects
that you need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not showing pictures of everybody,
but, you know, Terrence has done so much
[SPEAKER_01]: with us for a lot of the Apple work,
Dave Eisenstadt at Penn State,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did a lot of work together with Root
Biology and understanding that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Abe Stroke in chem engineering,
bringing in different expertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only expertise, but then also from
more basic and more fundamental to
[SPEAKER_01]: applied, an extension that's equally
important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's important to find really
good people to work with to carry these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of the technicians that I've
had, Steve Denning and currently Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Piccioni and Rick Dunstead and Fredonia,
and we've had visiting scientists and
[SPEAKER_01]: students over the years that have done a
huge amount of extra work, and just a few
[SPEAKER_01]: of those to represent that important
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, some general observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that we tend to trap,
we fall into is, we come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: hypotheses and they become our babies,
you know, and there's this tendency to
[SPEAKER_01]: really do all you can to prove the
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because you came up with it
and you want to be successful,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think this too often we end up sort
of either designing experiments that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more likely to give supporting
information, where really what we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is we need to be our harshest critics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do our damnedest to refute the
hypothesis, because it's our hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know it best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we should really, really try our
best to disprove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't, you've got something
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't say, well, okay,
well, can we come up with a condition or
[SPEAKER_01]: situation in which that's not going to
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can, then there's probably
something wrong with that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need to either throw it out or
modify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you keep working through by trying
to disprove these things, I think in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, you're going to come up with a much
stronger hypothesis that, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: will be closer to that principle that
Emerson said will be able to explain a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's this tendency,
and again, I think it may be tied in with
[SPEAKER_01]: the need to get grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're writing grant proposal,
we're having to be salesmen to always
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to sell our idea to a granting
agency, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it tends to put us into a positive
support kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But scientifically, we need to do the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we have to be careful not
falling into that trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, Nelson Shalas here that a
few of you may have met this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was our famous viticulturist and really
the father of canopy management in grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was also a very wise man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really was constantly beating on us
about be specific about what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so things like vigor, when he was in
the room, you were not allowed to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: term vigor, because it wasn't clear what
it meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you talk to people, sometimes
the best way to really focus in on
[SPEAKER_01]: something is asking what the units are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say vigor, okay, what's the units?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then it forces you to be more
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, things like crop load.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways of saying
crop load and resistance, tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, you know, quality is not an
attribute of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the interaction of that
product with the expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The expectations of the user, that's
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a lot of cases, we don't measure
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might measure attributes related to
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just try to be more specific and try
not to use so many vague terms,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you use them, at least define them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Aristotle had a nice generalities of
the refuge of weak minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's maybe a little harsh, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I think the main point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we have to continually use all
the tools that we can and use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, again, in our situation,
I think it's very important to use those
[SPEAKER_01]: in the context of understanding the whole
plant in the environment that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually growing, especially if we're
specifically interested in horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so molecular biology is really
important to help elucidate what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked with Susheng on
understanding what low light actually
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really does change the chemistry
and biochemistry of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps really give a much better
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by itself isn't going to be as
valuable as in context with all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the plant physiology, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And engineering technologies, as I've
learned working with Abe, really allow us
[SPEAKER_01]: to measure things that we had never really
thought about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Taron's doing work with CT scanning
to be able to look at things that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: never see before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those are really important to
take those, again, in context with what
[SPEAKER_01]: our problems are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we need to move along here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, these are just some quotes that I
think I've collected that I think are
[SPEAKER_01]: useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intelligent person is not he who has the
answers, but he who knows what questions
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the real voyage of discovery lies not
in seeking new lands, but in seeing with
[SPEAKER_01]: new eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to be able to get the
same information that everyone else sees
[SPEAKER_01]: and see something different in it than
everyone else sees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, in our area, especially
pomology and viticulture, Chalice pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, she said we should look for
unquestioned answers as much as for
[SPEAKER_01]: unanswered questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have a lot of dogma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look behind it, and there's many
times very little scientific basis behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one paper or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a concept called
contradictory results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think basically, I don't think there
are such things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're really reflecting our
inadequate understanding of what the
[SPEAKER_01]: governing principle is of that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you know what the principle is,
then the results may be different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're not contradictory,
as I pointed out earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, enthusiasm is another important
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of really, there's not a
lot of Nobel winners that weren't pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: darn enthusiastic about what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enthusiasm is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought Churchill was talking about
science here, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Success is the ability to go from one
failure to another with no loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's very important for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we don't need to read all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to read all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing is that, as I mentioned
earlier, I think it's quite important to
[SPEAKER_01]: do modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you never actually come out
with a mathematical final output,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the process of trying to say,
well, what is this system?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the components of this system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drawing a modeling diagram,
I think, is a very useful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you begin to see
interrelationships that you hadn't thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's important,
though, to remember, since they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: great simplifications, that all models are
wrong, but some models are useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the important thing is to focus on
usefulness, not on the absolute perfection
[SPEAKER_01]: of a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because models can never be perfect,
or they wouldn't be a model, because you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: have everything described.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Einstein always said,
make it as simple as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no simpler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of like this finding the
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets too complex, you really can't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the modeler learns to not be able to
really understand their model.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many interactions that you just
can't keep track.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too simple, it's just not
realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you try to find those key central
mechanisms that give realistic behavior,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are not so complex that you can't
understand the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, it's important to
remember that models never provide
[SPEAKER_01]: answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only provide quantitative hypotheses,
because they're just estimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the important thing is that they're
quantitative hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can predict that under this
condition, you should get this much dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you something that's really
testable then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think modeling is a very,
very useful tool, even if you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, just the intellectual process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so if you can, take at least a
small part of your time to pursue ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: that nobody else either understands or
would think about or would want you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had proposals sent back saying,
no, you don't get funny, and we don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: want you to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, 10 years later,
the growers came back and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you advise me on how to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you have to have confidence
in your own ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another one about don't ask
what the world needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask what makes you come alive and go do
it, because that's really important rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than doing somebody else's ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, be persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started the modeling 25 years ago,
and it's finally paying off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to be as old as I am to
get a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: But persistence helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this includes not only visiting
scientist student, but the administrative
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even our buildings and property staff
in Geneva helped me so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some ideas as to how to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really takes quite a large team to
really have a good program like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Veterans Day, so let's remember
our veterans too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in patents on an initial design,
which worked, but is difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've modified the design and have a
patent pending on that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all going through CTEK.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, the potential concern for stone
fruits is there's a lot of gumming that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get with injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that may cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples seem to have a relatively neutral
kind of wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't respond too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some sensors in, and that looks
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapes, we hope to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, grapes tend to have
quite small trunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in our area, we replace trunks
because of winter injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may be a little bit small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, in theory, it could go into the
corner of other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although annuals are rapidly growing and
may not be as easy to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems logical to go in with crops
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You made it all sound so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, you had said that it's
persistence and enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any things that you wish you had
time to do with yet another career?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a brief bullet point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, that's why I'm retiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get away from the committees and
the reports, and I can go back to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I always wanted to do that I
never really got around to was in fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, when you have very low rootling
density, like apples and grapes tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: have rootling density in terms of length
of roots and volume of soil, grass roots
[SPEAKER_01]: might be 500 to 1,000 times that of
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got one apple root,
you've got 1,000 grape roots, or grass
[SPEAKER_01]: roots, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of water use, as we showed on
some of those days, the apple trees were
[SPEAKER_01]: using 90% as much as the grass,
as an acre of grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the same water use, but you're sucking
that water through maybe one in 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: grape roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the calculations suggest there should
be localized drying around that root
[SPEAKER_01]: system in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is consistent with some studies
that have been done that in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, even with excess irrigation,
150% of ET, you can still have local
[SPEAKER_01]: drying and a reduction in water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always wondered if I could use a mini
rhizotron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taryn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a mini rhizotron to actually visualize
and see if we could see that localized
[SPEAKER_01]: drying around the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these types of systems, it must be
drying out the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it depends on the soil, hydraulic
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In retirement, I'm going to be mostly
following up on the micro potentiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the models that we've been using,
we need to continue working on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want more time to do those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to your philosophical start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering whether some of what
you were describing to us is a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the Bohr model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your carbon model, you were saying you
didn't really go into that with a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: applied result.
[SPEAKER_02]: You worked on it for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was confident that it was such a central
mechanism that the applications were going
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could say that Bohr was pretty
sure that he understood the applications
[SPEAKER_02]: were going to be a lot of applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess the real, and maybe it's a
false sentence, was that I was saying it
[SPEAKER_01]: not from saying, well, I just want to
study the fundamental behavior of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know why New Zealand could
produce quite so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we understood that, then hopefully
that might give us an advance in being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to maybe improve our production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you described the back and forth
experimental work and the modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I guess I would say the type of
actual work that you do might be exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I go out and measure, say,
the processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Brian Shabbat measured the
processes of a wild strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, an ecological reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to apply a butcher system reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same techniques,
but we were coming from different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in our particular case,
I found it more useful to give that
[SPEAKER_01]: context by starting out with an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practical importance, and then looking
into the fundamental basis of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think you stand a better chance
of being able to come back the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, like we said, it's shifting a
little this way or that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do they produce twice as many
apples in New Zealand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some of ours are older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second,
[SPEAKER_01]: the apple leaves do not seem to
physiologically age.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be seven months old and still
have 58% photosynthesis rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the conditions are good,
they just keep cranking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have an extremely long growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the weather conditions,
the carbon balance of the day is optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: under conditions that are mostly sunny,
but with some clouds that provide some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of radiation around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then high temperatures in the low 70s,
low to mid 70s, and cool down to 50s at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, that's optimum for carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we run the carbon balance model,
can we look to see what's optimum?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a very long growing season,
trees are very good at adapting to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have excess sinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when you have a good condition,
you can add sinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think climate change, with the CO2
going up, I think food crops are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the ones that will have a big positive
response to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at least with apples, the fruit
set, the numbers of fruit depend on the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add more carbon, you'll increase
the numbers of fruit that are set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because you have an unlimited
number of sinks, you maintain the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't down regulate the way you get
in some plants that don't have the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to add sinks when you add extra carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been, unfortunately,
very few studies that have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: give us that type of data over the whole
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a great one that they had
about a 40% increase in total dry matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% increase in yield, and with no change
in ripening qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's quite a few different
factors that I think we can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the apple abort and they drop,
is that the apple itself self-aborting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it lacking enough carbon in the tree to
really make the carbon stress and then
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's basically the carbon supply to
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you, for example, shade a whole
tree, you reduce the light coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you've got gradients of
light within the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fruit that's in the inside that
might already be at 20% of outside light,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they're going to be reducing more,
and then they all fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones near the bottom of the tree,
that's when to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones up near the top that are really
well exposed, you may reduce the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't reduce their growth very
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start out mostly local effects with
carbon moving, but it can move all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can move over in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it starts out fairly local,
and then it can move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a clear answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the individual fruit's response
to carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the flower buds are developing at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're initiating the flower bud just
about at the same time as all this fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, they develop the buds in terms
of all the little tiny structures and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that Martin got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did find, when we looked,
we were looking at the effects of European
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites reducing the photosynthesis
of the foliage in the beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had different levels of injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked to see what did that do to
the whole tree photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then related that to the fruit
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also then looked next year to see
what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, we did it two different
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year, the flower bud initiation must
have occurred before the mites hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we had a pretty good number of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the mites hit, they didn't
develop very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't send any fruit the next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other year, we didn't get the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a low crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we looked at the return cropping,
it corresponded very, very nicely with the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon balance in whole tree
photosynthesis per fruit during that later
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there is a lot of interactions
between those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it does appear that those flower
buds, even though they're tiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't require any significant amount
of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a small demand, but apparently
are weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to imply that everything is
carbon water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many, many other factors that go
in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the things that we found did
correlate, and we're able to model them.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
