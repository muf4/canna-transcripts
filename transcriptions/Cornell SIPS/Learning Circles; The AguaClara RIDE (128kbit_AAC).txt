[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the title is, I guess, already
confusing, Learning Circles and the Hour
[SPEAKER_01]: Clatter Ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an engineer, so it would be very
easy to put me in a box with nice square
[SPEAKER_01]: sides, made up of lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also very tempting to think of
our education as linear, as a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start out as a freshman, you take some
courses, and you build, and eventually you
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate as a senior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I threw the word circles up here to
get you thinking about how maybe it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Hour Clatter Ride,
I should define the abbreviation,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ride is research, invent, design,
and power.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a student give me this at graduation
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite sayings has been
that it's a short walk to the edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: She turned it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering how many of you noticed
that there's an interesting word inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the word knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's funny is, so you're a lot
smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been talking about this phrase for
years and had never made that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when she created this little
graphic and gave it to me, it's clear that
[SPEAKER_01]: those shoes are about to walk off the
edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's a short walk to the edge
of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of my philosophy,
or something that I believe dearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my sense is, if you think it's not a
short walk to the edge, or if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten to the edge, you've not walked very
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in any discipline, you don't have
to go very far before you get to the edge,
[SPEAKER_01]: where there are things that you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think letting our students know that
is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tempting to let our
undergraduates think that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more fun to let them know that we
don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing Agua Clata since 2004,
2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to figure out how to talk
about it is one of the challenges,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like everything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you three slices,
a perspective from Honduras, a global
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, and then a Cornell
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Honduras, the problem that we're
working on is there are water supplies
[SPEAKER_01]: where Honduras is mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountains everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so almost anywhere where there's a
human settlement, there's a mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: that's higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are streams up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rainfall in Honduras in many
places is half decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's often streams that are
running year round, or springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they do is they go up in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find a spring, or a little mountain
stream, or maybe even a river,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on where they're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they take a pipe down to a
distribution tank, and then onto the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get water out of your tap in
your household.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you know about Millennium
Development Goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Millennium Development Goals,
one of them says that we should reduce by
[SPEAKER_01]: half the fraction of people that don't
have access to improved drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just met that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except that the word was improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is improved, because it comes out
of the tap in your house, even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: river water.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and Agua Clata is working on solving
that problem of having dirty river water
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of your tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that's actually not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that's not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though I understand why it is
considered improved, it's not the end
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've done is we've developed
technology that would treat that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 2005, our partner in Honduras
has built these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight plants in seven locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I can't count.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's seven pictures up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what a plant looks like in a CAD
drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my little bragging here is this is the
result of, I don't know, 10,000 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell undergraduate and a few master of
engineering students writing code so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go onto our website and request a
design for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give it the flow rate that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get this CAD drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's generated automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the technology that I don't know of
other places where they're doing that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of automated parametric design where
everything scales the way it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: scale to handle the flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now the real thing, looking inside
one of our plants, a 12 liter per second
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, serving four villages, four poor
rural villages in southern Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants, what we do is we take very dirty
surface water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we turn it into clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do it all without electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems amazingly simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a sense, it is very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of doing this, we've done an
awful lot of research in our labs to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding at a very fundamental
level of what are these processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: what controls, how well they work,
and how do you make them faster and more
[SPEAKER_01]: cost effective and easier to use from the
operator's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that was a slice of what's happening
in Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's go to the global
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we do investigation, innovation,
education, and design, all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Aguaclada R&D here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the process of forming Aguaclada
LLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a business that will provide the
engineering services for the partners who
[SPEAKER_01]: end up building these facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Aguaclada LLC will work globally and
provide services to partners who work in a
[SPEAKER_01]: country or maybe even in a region in a
country at building these facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go down one step further,
there are the organizations that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: operate the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be a community elected water
board that runs the water treatment plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: collects the tariff, and makes sure that
hires the operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the people at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that drink the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes it look like this is all a
hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a little bit troubled by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all interconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's sharing of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get really excited about feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feedback is how you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about, are your kids an
experiment as researchers when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: children?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they an experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And either you acknowledge that they are
or you pretend that they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of course they're an experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a child, do you want to be
experimented on by your parents?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a pitch for yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if your parents don't admit that
they're experimenting on you, it means
[SPEAKER_01]: that they won't learn when they screw up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what feedback does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn based on your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I teach, I often admit to my
students that they're guinea pigs in this
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm experimenting on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying out educational techniques on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm intending to learn from that to
make sure that I can do it better the next
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe being experimented on isn't such
a bad idea, within reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get really excited about feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feedback is one of the reasons that Agua
Clata plants in the real world produce
[SPEAKER_01]: clean drinking water and why many of the
other technologies that have been put
[SPEAKER_01]: forth have not worked nearly as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because we use feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we make them better every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd look at what causes systems to
fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hence, how do you eliminate those
failure modes the next time around?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This arrow could go in either direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's communication that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it connecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that if a plant operator in
Honduras has difficulty running a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are mechanisms by which I will hear
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could turn into a research
project for my students to figure out how
[SPEAKER_01]: to fix that problem so that it's easier to
operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were designing a new layout for our
watershed and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we send a CAD drawing of this new
layout to Honduras to our implementation
[SPEAKER_01]: partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technician at that organization,
not the engineer, but the technician,
[SPEAKER_01]: looks at that drawing and says,
ah, but that's not going to work because
[SPEAKER_01]: he gave me some reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would have been unfortunate for the
operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we never ended up making that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never ended up building that design
because before it was built, we had
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that was two slices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what did we do first?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did the big picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we didn't do this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of these, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell's around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, there's one in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Geneva, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are implementation
partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one partner in Honduras now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're spinning up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another partner in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will eventually happen in other
countries as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will ultimately be many
implementation partners around the planet
[SPEAKER_01]: that are building our cloud of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each of them will be working with
multiple water boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of them will be working with many
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I guess it's a big pyramid scheme,
but hopefully in a benevolent sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so now at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is now getting closer to the nitty
gritty of the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where you can start thinking
about how might you generalize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so there's research, invent,
design, and power.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I want to talk about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so a freshman coming in can take my
introductory course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an intro to engineering course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right off, we mix things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in that class, I call it a design
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: A freshman design class?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they design when they're freshmen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our pedagogy says, you have to wait
until you're seniors to do design work.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in engineering, that's what we
think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I call it design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually design and build a lab
scale water treatment plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: computer controlled and that produces
clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have sensors to verify that it
meets US drinking water standards when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that in small teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that they don't understand
everything that is all the theory behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I give them a taste of the different
theories so they have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough that it makes sense to them by the
time it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is doing things completely out of
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really important because
then later on when they take a theory
[SPEAKER_01]: class, they've already seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know I'm not pulling their leg
about how things work because they've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: how this worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know what was important in making
this system work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the theory makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluid mechanics is one of the hard courses
in engineering curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always said, you should really
take the course twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the second time around,
there are things that are taught at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the course which will now
make sense to you that didn't make sense
[SPEAKER_01]: because you went down a line and the stuff
in the beginning, you just couldn't figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how to wrap your head around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you learned the stuff at the
end, you can come back and it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all of us who've gone through
multiple levels of courses, we've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced that where things that didn't
make sense now begin to make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many credits for that one,
one, two, and one?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a three credit course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a three credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, everything's three credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So freshmen do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juniors or seniors can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a sophomore do this once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she did great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All out of sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, then over here is the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where students are working on
the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing research or design work,
doing research in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_01]: Graduate students, there are project
courses that are for freshmen and
[SPEAKER_01]: sophomores who have not yet taken or
juniors who have not yet taken this
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a senior level course
that is for people who have already taken
[SPEAKER_01]: this theory class.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the same project, but now they
can get design credit for working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas these folks, they don't actually
get any credit that's worth anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, they know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're a master of engineering
students who are taking the course or the
[SPEAKER_01]: project for their design project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do is I wrap a circle around
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And students from those three entry ways
into that course all come to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all meet together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we split them up into teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we split them up into teams very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, and I don't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I delegate this to my team leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They split them up into teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are mixes of student abilities,
mixes of ages of students or location in
[SPEAKER_01]: their degree program all mixed together to
create these small teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, there's also a summer internship at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this great program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no money, no credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come work for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's amazing is that students do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like 20 students come and work
every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's amazing what you can make Cornell
students do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I know that half of you are Cornell
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then there's an engineering and
context course where I take about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: students to Honduras for two weeks during
the January intersession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, there's no credit for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not officially connected with any
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something cool to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see it as an integral part of the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pointed to this time in Honduras as
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've pointed to this stuff as service
just to reverse things for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the service learning model,
you tend to think of what you do on campus
[SPEAKER_01]: as a learning time and what you do at the
project site as service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually think, in this case,
it's more reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the useful things that will
help our folks, our partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the useful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're in Honduras,
they're mostly learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want to ask a question about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell my director.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I trust this many people?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I give two lectures per semester in
this course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not per week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two per semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's team time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to work in projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time for some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's time to go alt tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this is the Wiki for that project
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we divide up into teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to make another
PowerPoint slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's all these topics that are
currently being researched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of those would link to another
Wiki page where they'll describe what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be posting their reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they work during the semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a little blurb about each of
them, which you could read on forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, that's what's happening
in that course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Students have a design challenge,
or a challenge that they're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A research challenge, or a design
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working on that for the
duration of the semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're writing reports every couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're evaluating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who evaluates them?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here's the teams of three to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said some of this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Range from developing new theories,
optimizing performance, developing new
[SPEAKER_01]: fabrication methods, creating design
algorithms.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All under this overarching create safe
drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leadership structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I'm director of the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I describe this as servant leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my job is to provide the resources so
that the team members can be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are undergraduates, graduates,
and faculty who work together to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback to individual teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have undergraduates who actually read
some of the reports and evaluate them and
[SPEAKER_01]: give them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a graduate student who's doing some
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm doing some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share the load between us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have student leaders who organize the
training sessions for the tools that are
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are research tools that we've
created over the years that make it
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to automate the operation of
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the ways that makes it
possible for students who can't spend 40
[SPEAKER_01]: hours a week in the lab to actually do
meaningful research.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can automate their experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have to learn how to use that
automation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my students create the tutorials to
train the new students coming in how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't do any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My students do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a student leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: She creates a syllabus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And says what's happening on each day
during the semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she tells me what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, you're giving your talk on this
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an undergraduate, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been doing it for the last two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the graduate students have a
completely different experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to have about two graduate
students, only two for this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they end up having this experience of
basically being managing a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get to do what faculty normally
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, faculty run a research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: My graduate students effectively run a
research program where they have multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: students working under them in a servant
leadership kind of way, working on
[SPEAKER_01]: different research projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the middle of the semester,
we have this symposium system where we
[SPEAKER_01]: used to do PowerPoint presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all sit there and watch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we realized after a while that that
wasn't the most effective way to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about what each of the teams was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point of this symposium is that you
want an opportunity for all of the teams
[SPEAKER_01]: to figure out what all the other teams are
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sharing of knowledge between
teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're doing very different kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each team is a very different kind of
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they give short presentations right
next to their experimental apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can actually point to it and
explain how it works, demonstrate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do it in relatively small groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we end up spending four class periods,
four 75-minute class periods to rotate all
[SPEAKER_01]: the teams through all the stations so that
everybody gets to tell everyone else
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on and also gets to see all
the other teams that are doing their
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another example of peer-based
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now going to Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some pictures from Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Students getting to see the Albuquerque
had a plan, getting to talk, interview the
[SPEAKER_01]: operator, find out what works,
what doesn't work, what kind of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: they've intended to have, and just fully
engage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where the learning and service
are really closely tied together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a filtration system that
students had developed over the previous
[SPEAKER_01]: semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're attempting to deploy it in
Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of this is it's not going to
be used yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a first deployment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try it and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our partner in Honduras can see what
technologies are that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll get their ideas spinning about,
well, where might this kind of technology
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make sense in their context?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll give feedback to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given that this was the first time we
deployed this filter, it also had
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get feedback about what failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to our lab to fix the
next semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get to look at our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get to see how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is looking at a sedimentation
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're taking it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our students are getting to see how
this really looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had opportunities to see pictures and
to see AutoCAD drawings in previous
[SPEAKER_01]: semesters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all comment that there's nothing
like actually seeing the real thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how it all fits together.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now the world that many of us live
in where there are these three spheres.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marcia made it clear that apparently
I'm doing something that is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't fully realized this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sucked them all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I confuse my director
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's like, is that research or is
that teaching?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's accounting issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are accounting issues that drive
them crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because was that research or teaching?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how would I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was research that's part of a
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Community scale drinking water is what I'm
working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what has been my focus for the last
eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of it fits underneath that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few reflections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hands-on learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mixing up application and theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of our students are incredibly
highly motivated to do something to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can tap into that, you've got a
really powerful connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make them work hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can invite them to work hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide an amazing volunteer
workforce.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So four papers per year published in
decent journals over the last two years
[SPEAKER_01]: that are research results coming out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of students engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 students in the summer, 35 students in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the project courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 55 students in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many inventions were open source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open source is so efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you invent something,
you just throw it on the web and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to talk to C-Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just throw it on the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody else can patent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that labs that are so tied into
making sure that nobody else can use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they end up wasting a lot of time making
sure that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our students write their reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they write their reports every
two weeks, those are immediately posted on
[SPEAKER_01]: the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stuff that they're developing during
the semester is protected from somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to patent it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have many inventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a new theory for flocculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to know about flocculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we have a new theory for that
that will eventually hit the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a little bit of work to
debunk old theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 30,000 people with safe drinking
water in Honduras.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an I work a lot at LLC spinoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have an incredibly cost
effective resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research model in that we can generate
lots of results with a few graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: students and on a tight budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
