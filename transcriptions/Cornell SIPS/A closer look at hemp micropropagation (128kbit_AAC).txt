[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, this is a closer look at hemp
micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Adam Gannon, and my wonderful
partner for this project was Uday Patel.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a little bit of history on hemp
micropropagation, there wasn't really any
[SPEAKER_01]: published research on hemp
micropropagation before the late 1990s due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the illegal status of the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first published work was done by
Ranali and Mendelino in the late 90s that
[SPEAKER_01]: I could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as regulations and legislation
have become more lenient with research
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts on hemp micropropagation,
have increased and gained traction into
[SPEAKER_01]: the late 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first systems for hemp
micropropagation being published in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently all kinds of different
aspects of hemp propagation are studied,
[SPEAKER_01]: including different media types,
photo period, cannabinoid synthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic variation, among others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things and some great work has even
been done by our excellent teachers,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Virgin and Victor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who would like to micropropagate hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: First place I thought of was nurseries and
professional propagators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is becoming more specialized,
I would say, as the hemp industry
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to legalize in different states
and countries, but probably not yet a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of professional hemp propagators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another place would be commercial
cultivators in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So commercial cannabis operations may want
to use micropropagation as a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve clean genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These genetics can be of high value for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so obviously researchers,
places like the USDA, Cornell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and several other universities
micropropagate hemp for various research
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, maybe hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend I met back when I started
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis was trying to micropropagate
hemp, I don't know, four or five years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, just at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still something I've never tried to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was impressed by that always.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you know anyone who has done hemp
micropropagation as a hobby?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would someone micropropagate hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many reasons to micropropagate
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few of these include rapid clonal
propagation, genetic preservation,
[SPEAKER_01]: sanitation of a mother stock, space
preservation, cannabinoid production,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a solution to poor germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of these, genetic preservation and
sanitation of the mother plants are of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing importance in the commercial
cannabis industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first and one of the most important
steps in micropropagation is selection of
[SPEAKER_01]: the source or stock plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: As mentioned in the previous slide,
there can be many reasons to
[SPEAKER_01]: micropropagate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So selecting source material based on the
right reason is the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant or source material has been
selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good sterilization protocols are utilized
and specific selections of the stock plant
[SPEAKER_01]: are selected as explants for further
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we will go over some common supplies
used in the micropropagation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the laminar flow hood,
this workbench uses a continuous stream of
[SPEAKER_00]: air passed through a HEPA filter to
maintain an airborne contaminant-free
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following that, we have a petri dish for
easier propagulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbead sterilizer uses very hot
glass beads to sterilize tools between
[SPEAKER_00]: usages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And arranged into this picture,
we have forceps of varying lengths along
[SPEAKER_00]: with a small razor blade for ease of
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a close-up of a set of forceps
that have tooth tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find this particularly useful when
handling delicate stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, 70% ethanol is a simple and
cost-effective way to sterilize a
[SPEAKER_00]: workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the containers and media, we've had
good success with both test tubes and
[SPEAKER_00]: magenta boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The test tubes are particularly good for
long-term growth since they accommodate
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp's vertical growth habit, while the
magenta box is nice since it offers a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger space to start multiple cuttings in
without all of the extra hassle of setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up individual culturing vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the growth media, Merchig and Skoog
has worked well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up your workspace correctly within
the flow hood is important to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: creating turbulent air currents that might
bring in contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured on the left is a cluttered bench
top, while on the right, adequate space
[SPEAKER_00]: and clearance has been made to allow for
good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand good flow hood technique,
let's take a look at some examples of what
[SPEAKER_00]: not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first image, Adam's body is too far
into the flow hood and is likely causing
[SPEAKER_00]: turbulent air currents over his workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle image, another container is
open under Adam's right arm, and he runs
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of it being contaminated as he
works over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the final image, the culture vessel is
being worked on too close to the edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flow hood, where its effectiveness is
being reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good flow hood technique can be summed up
in this single image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see Adam's body is out of the
flow hood, with the material being worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on deeper within the hood, and Adam's arms
are extended to work on the plants at that
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The container here is closed, so no
accidental contamination can occur before
[SPEAKER_00]: it is ready to be worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micropropagation workflow begins with
removing the X-plant onto a clean work
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we used an autoclave petri
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two forceps were particularly useful
when trying to manipulate tender stems at
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: To subculture our X-plant, we needed a
small fragment of the current plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, a segment with two nodes in the
middle is sufficient, and here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: result of one cutting being prepared for
subculturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to add the prop yield to the culture
vessel, it isn't necessary to insert a
[SPEAKER_00]: node into the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only requirement is enough stem tissue
is inserted to hold the cutting upright as
[SPEAKER_00]: it develops roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A crucial final step in the
micropropagation process is sealing and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling your containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sealing can be done by wrapping plastic
wrap or parafilm at the lid-to-vessel
[SPEAKER_00]: junction point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling can either be done directly on
the container or the tray holding your
[SPEAKER_00]: culture vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp's preferred lighting at this growth
stage is 100 to 300 PPFDs per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting should be kept at the 18 hours
on, 6 hours off mark to ensure the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: remain in a vegetative state and don't
start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmer temps are preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: 76 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit is a good
range, but while the conditions I
[SPEAKER_00]: described are the optimal ones,
hemp in the micropropagation environment
[SPEAKER_00]: will tolerate lower lighting and varying
temperatures to an extent.

Thank you.
