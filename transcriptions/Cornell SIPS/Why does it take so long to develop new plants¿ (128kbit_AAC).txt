[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get asked a lot about how long does
it take to get a variety out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd walk you through what we
did with Archer, my newest strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Archer was a selection I made very
early in my career here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was done very much in the
traditional sense of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see every step was done
through the field on a year by year basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a long time doing it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked on, and I'll talk about how
we've been speeding that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how Archer started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 99, we made some crosses,
made some hybridizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a lot of information to go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't worked on berries for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had the records from the past
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made some crosses, collected the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, that seed got treated and got
planted out into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just grow them in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted them in rows and let them
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have to grow a year, go through
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next spring, we get to see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've cleaned that up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on plastic to help with weed
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the process is generally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in the ground one spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next spring, we get to see fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a little bit of raised beds when
you get a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last year, we had water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so high, it went almost over the
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some years, we get a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some years, you get none.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't know that in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2001, we made the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 2001 selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some notes that day when I selected
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge kingberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, the primary berry that comes off a
strawberry in the industry, they'll call
[SPEAKER_00]: it the kingberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put very large Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I use the term queenberry as well,
rather than secondary, because it's easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not generally used in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote that it was firm, a good
interior color, good flavor, tart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some notes that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked three fruit, a primary berry,
a secondary berry, and a tertiary berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add those up, it's almost 100 grams of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I calculated if you took 100 grams of
fruit, which is only three berries per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, on a per acre basis, that's over
4,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant produces more than three fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see this kind of thing,
we're like, wow, we got yield right away
[SPEAKER_00]: because we got a lot of fruit size that
comes off very quickly and it comes off at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us to have a tertiary berry in the
16-gram size is a very good berry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 will get you about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 grams will be about the size of a plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's larger than what you normally see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll pick berries down to about 8 to
10 grams is acceptable for a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that year, we had one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there is, is one plant from
that one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever runners it produced,
we collected those runners, rooted them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a picture from that first
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the prettiest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there holding them with one hand,
taking a picture with the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it gets it in my head so I can
look back and say, oh, I remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a picture, kind of a record as we
go, you start a plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a year to make the run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you plant them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to wait another year before
they fruit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at it for two or three
years, because we want to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it going to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to have some disease that
wipes it out in the first second year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant going to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to produce runners?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect more runners from the next
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you plant another plot,
and you do it again to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to plant it in
different locations to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't plant it in the best possible
location, and it was great, but in a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to die very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted multiple plots in different
locations so that we can see this over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to evaluate it for
several years to see how it comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, to see how the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they persist in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it have a good yield every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time to go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can really take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that way, most of the
selections get sloughed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found wanting for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're susceptible to some disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce enough runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit quality declines over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're planting the
same plant every time, and that when it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces fruit, the fruit looks like what
we think it's supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each time, each cycle, you're taking
pictures to make sure everything is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we decided these are
looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move it into tissue
culture, because to take it off the
[SPEAKER_00]: station, we need disease-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't collect stuff from the field and
send it out to growers or to a nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it could have any kind of pathogen on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we move it into tissue culture to clean
it up, make sure it doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, make sure it doesn't have
phytophthora, verticillium, various fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can take a few months,
but it can take a year or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties don't tissue culture well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to check them for virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to produce more plants so we can
put them back out in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure tissue culture didn't screw it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you put things in tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you get out of tissue culture doesn't
look like what you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to make sure that we grow
plants, make sure they're true to type,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they look like what you expect
them to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, of course, take more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure it looks like it's
supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure you have the same
product that you, in the end, of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we confirmed trueness of type.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that stage, we're like, OK,
we got virus-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send it to the nursery so they can
propagate it in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, we can get it to some of the
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014, we sent out 16,000-plus plants
to 11 growers across the state so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could grow it in a large scale and give me
some feedback on how it looks for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does it look in a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to that point, we had 25-foot plots at
the biggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they get 1,000 plants or 2,000
plants, and you can see it on an eighth of
[SPEAKER_00]: an acre or a quarter of an acre and
actually see it in a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evaluate it the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evaluate it again the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the growers will grow it in a
perennial setting, and they want to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this takes 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to this point, and we're finally,
OK, it's time to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being released today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being announced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is available to growers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't plant it until next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, we're taking pictures all
along to make sure that it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the growers will do or what the
nursery will charge is a propagation fee
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the cost of propagation is offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not the same price.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not selling the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're offsetting the cost of
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's semantics, but it is not available to
commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was only available to
growers of the New York State Berry
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Association through a cooperative
agreement with Cornell University that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with the association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't send it to just any growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent it to growers who were part of
this organization that we had a contract
[SPEAKER_00]: with for doing the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fruit I got from a commercial
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved forward so that it's now going to
be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will plant the first commercial
crop this coming spring in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we won't see that fruit until
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's time every time you have
to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can really take a long time to get
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
