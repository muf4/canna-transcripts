[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you guys all for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am really excited to share with you what
I've been working on for the last six
[SPEAKER_02]: years in Polaroid virus research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I just realized my mic's not on.
Okay, better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so my research focuses on plant
pathogenic viruses in the genus Polaroid
[SPEAKER_02]: virus and the family Luteoviridae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polaroid viruses have a single strand of
positive sense RNA genome, meaning that
[SPEAKER_02]: the genome itself is protein coding.
[SPEAKER_02]: These viruses move in both aphids and
plants as icosahedral virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike many other plant pathogenic
viruses, Polaroid viruses are transmitted
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusively by aphids in a circulative,
non-propagative manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aphids deposit virions directly into the
phloem, shown here in red, while they're
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The virus then replicates and moves
systemically, but never crosses out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This phloem restriction is believed to be
an adaptation to facilitate acquisition by
[SPEAKER_02]: sap-feeding aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The symptoms caused by Polaroid virus
infection vary by host and species,
[SPEAKER_02]: but often include interveinal chlorosis,
as you can see in this infected hairy
[SPEAKER_02]: nightshade plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polaroid viruses are an emerging problem
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shown here is a summary of the geographic
distribution of new and emerging Polaroid
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses in 2018 alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple stars with pop-out boxes represent
new Polaroid virus species.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same year, Polaroid virus species were
reported for the first time on eight new
[SPEAKER_02]: hosts, shown by blue stars, and in seven
new countries, shown by orange stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like other RNA viruses, Polaroid viruses
mutate and evolve extremely rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, even species that have not been
an issue in an area for many years can
[SPEAKER_02]: experience a resurgence if new strains
emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, the use of insecticides to
control aphid vectors is neither costly
[SPEAKER_02]: nor fast-efficient nor effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time a grower realizes they have a
Polaroid virus in their field,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's often too late to contain the
outbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, insecticide resistance is a
growing issue in aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, we have several well-studied
Polaroid virus species that we can use as
[SPEAKER_02]: models.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potato leaf roll virus, or PLRV,
affects solanaceous plants and causes a
[SPEAKER_02]: net necrosis disease of potato that was
once an enormous problem in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turnip yellows virus, or TUIV,
is a pathogen of brassicas and is
[SPEAKER_02]: currently of economic importance on
canola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decades of research have generated an
excellent toolkit for studying these two
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses, including infectious clones,
which allow us to inoculate plants by
[SPEAKER_02]: agrobacterium infiltration, virion
purification protocols, a wealth of
[SPEAKER_02]: homemade and commercially available
antibodies, which are useful for ELISA,
[SPEAKER_02]: Western Blot, and other applications,
and protocols for rearing aphid vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I've labeled this box a virus
mutant library, but the real resource here
[SPEAKER_02]: is Stuart Gray, who is one of the foremost
Polaroid virus biologists in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're fortunate to have him located
here at Cornell, just across the street
[SPEAKER_02]: from our lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuart has been incredibly generous with
his expertise, his equipment, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, his mutant library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this project would not have been
possible without him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another advantage to working with Polaroid
viruses in general is the small size of
[SPEAKER_02]: their genome, which is about 5.8 kilobases
and encodes only nine known proteins,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'll walk you through briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: P0 functions in suppressing host
silencing, which is the primary plant
[SPEAKER_02]: defense against viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: P1 and P2 encode a polyprotein and a
fusion protein, which are important for
[SPEAKER_02]: replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: P3A and P4 function in movement in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: P3 and P5 are structural proteins,
which form the capsid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about these a little more in the
next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the functions of P6 and P7 remain
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_02]: As mentioned previously, Polaroid viruses
have icosahedral virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The capsid is made primarily of coat
protein, or CP, shown in blue and encoded
[SPEAKER_02]: by ORF3.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, sporadic read-through of an amber
stop codon causes translation through
[SPEAKER_02]: ORF5, producing a C-terminal extension
called the read-through domain,
[SPEAKER_02]: or RTD, shown here in orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resulting read-through protein,
or RTP, is incorporated into the capsid at
[SPEAKER_02]: a low frequency, with the RTD projecting
outward from the capsid surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: The RTD is also found in an unincorporated
form, which has been shown to have its own
[SPEAKER_02]: functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mutational analyses, primarily from
Stuart's lab, have pinpointed regions in
[SPEAKER_02]: the CP and RTD, which are important for
virion assembly, aphid transmission,
[SPEAKER_02]: movement in plants, and restriction to
phloem tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: In spite of the many tools available for
Polaroid virus research, the structural
[SPEAKER_02]: biology of these viruses remains difficult
to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: For starters, Polaroid viruses are
phloem-limited, which means that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: located in tissue that's hard to lice and
hard to separate from other tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also means that the overall virus
titer in the plant is quite low,
[SPEAKER_02]: as most of the plant cells are actually
not infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consequently, it's difficult to obtain a
large quantity of pure virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of these and other challenges,
there is no publicly available crystal
[SPEAKER_02]: structure for any Polaroid virus virion or
structural protein, which limits our
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to infer how mutations impact
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: One technique commonly used for studying
Polaroid virus structural biology is an
[SPEAKER_02]: RNAs protection assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this assay, virions extracted from
plants are subjected to a short treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: with RNAs, which digests any RNA that is
not protected by a capsid.
[SPEAKER_02]: After RNAs treatment, the protected RNA is
extracted and used for cDNA synthesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the presence of the viral genome is
assessed by conventional PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: In virion preparations that have not been
subjected to RNAs treatment, the genome is
[SPEAKER_02]: intact for both the wild-type virus and
this Delta Cp mutant, which is a mutant
[SPEAKER_02]: that does not produce virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the absence of the capsid in the
Delta Cp mutant leaves the genome
[SPEAKER_02]: vulnerable to RNAs, resulting in near
total degradation of viral RNA after RNAs
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This assay can be used to check whether
mutations in the Cp and RTP affect virion
[SPEAKER_02]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an example of one mutant from
Stuart's lab that has been tested in this
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This mutant contains two point mutations,
resulting in a leucine to proline and a
[SPEAKER_02]: histidine to proline substitution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the viral genome is produced,
we can see clearly in an RNAs protection
[SPEAKER_02]: assay that virions are unstable or
incomplete, indicating that this mutation
[SPEAKER_02]: disrupts capsid formation or stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: RNAs protection and other classical
approaches to studying cholera viruses
[SPEAKER_02]: have connected many mutations in the Cp
and RTD to defects in virion assembly,
[SPEAKER_02]: movement in plants, and aphid
transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet we're still missing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that these small changes in
co-protein sequence lead to a change in
[SPEAKER_02]: function?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the missing link here is protein
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: These mutations can result in small or
large perturbations in co-protein
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, which in turn may impact virion
assembly or interactions with plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: aphid proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: These changes are especially important for
cholera viruses, which move systemically
[SPEAKER_02]: in plants and aphids as virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as I mentioned before,
there are no publicly available crystal
[SPEAKER_02]: structures for any cholera virus virion or
structural protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without knowing what these proteins look
like, how can we link these changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: sequence to disruptions in the viral life
cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: To try to approach this problem from
another angle, we applied protein
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction reporter, or PIR, technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: PIR technology utilizes a mass spec
compatible cross-linker developed by our
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborator, Jim Bruce, at the University
of Washington in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a schematic of the PIR
cross-linker.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the bottom are two reactive groups,
which react with solvent-exposed lysines
[SPEAKER_02]: on the surface of proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Applying this cross-linker to a mixture of
protein complexes allows us to freeze
[SPEAKER_02]: protein-protein interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: After cross-linking, we break the proteins
into smaller pieces by digesting with
[SPEAKER_02]: trypsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: A biotin tag on the cross-linker allows us
to enrich for cross-link peptides before
[SPEAKER_02]: we run the samples through the mass spec.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, a mass-coded reporter at the center
of the cross-linker allows us to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-linked peptides in the mass spec,
targeting them for further analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the mass spec cleavable bonds
connecting the reactive groups to the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cross-linker enable isolation and
fragmentation of the peptides in each
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-linked pair.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mass spec cleavable bonds are what
make PIR revolutionary, as they're what
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us to easily determine which
peptides are cross-linked to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Application of the PIR cross-linker to
protein complexes yields several types of
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-links.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, like these ones in pink,
occur between two interacting proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cross-linker can also react with two
nearby reactive sites on the same protein,
[SPEAKER_02]: as shown by the yellow arrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, we see some dead end cross-links,
like these ones in black, between reactive
[SPEAKER_02]: sites and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: These cross-links are actually still
useful because they tell us which regions
[SPEAKER_02]: of the protein are solvent-exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because PIR technology identifies not only
which proteins interact with one another,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also which residues were cross-linked,
it gives us information that we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: for structural modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great because computational
modeling without any other information
[SPEAKER_02]: often results in hundreds or thousands of
possible models, as shown by the myriad of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways we can imagine putting this green
protein and blue protein together.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, finding a cross-link,
for example between the red dots on these
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins, tells us that these red dots
have to be near enough for a cross-linker
[SPEAKER_02]: to connect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the length of the cross-linker arms
as a distance constraint, we can instantly
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminate many of the possible models.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings me to the research portion of
my talk, which I'm going to divide into
[SPEAKER_02]: two sections based on the type of
cross-links that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first section, I'll talk about some
work in structural biology of
[SPEAKER_02]: Polariviruses using PIR-guided modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the second part of the talk,
I'll detail how we used PIR to explore
[SPEAKER_02]: host-virus interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to remind you that my
experiments are going to alternate between
[SPEAKER_02]: the use of our two model Polariviruses,
potato leaf roll virus and turnip yellows
[SPEAKER_02]: virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so let's talk about structural
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the absence of a crystal structure,
we can use PIR to make guided predictions
[SPEAKER_02]: using computational models.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Michelle Heck, Juan Chavez,
and Stacy de Blasio have already used PIR
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-linking data to generate
computational models of the PLRV
[SPEAKER_02]: co-protein trimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal in this first section of my talk
is to extend these techniques to TUI V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the co-protein sequence is
remarkably well conserved across
[SPEAKER_02]: Polariviruses, these virus, PLRV and TUI V
have different hosts and can cause
[SPEAKER_02]: different symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't know whether the interaction
topologies would be conserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: To apply PIR to study Polariviruses,
we first do a protein extraction from
[SPEAKER_02]: infected tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we do a crude virion purification,
which enriches for virions while retaining
[SPEAKER_02]: some host-virus interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Applying the PIR cross-linker to this
sample lends data about interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: between viral proteins, as well as
interactions between viral and host
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Importantly, the ather transmissibility of
every crude virion purification is tested
[SPEAKER_02]: prior to cross-linking to ensure that the
samples contain intact biologically active
[SPEAKER_02]: virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what we found when we applied
this workflow to TUI V.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a schematic of the TUI V
co-protein sequence shown in blue with the
[SPEAKER_02]: optional read-through domain shown as an
orange dotted arrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lysine at position 150 in the coat
protein was found cross-linked to another
[SPEAKER_02]: lysine at position 179.
[SPEAKER_02]: An important limitation of PIR is that we
can't tell whether these cross-linked
[SPEAKER_02]: lysines were on the same coat protein
monomer or on adjacent monomers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which limits our ability to use
cross-links like this one for modeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: although they're still useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remarkably, this exact cross-link was also
found in PLRV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be certain that these cross-links
are truly homologous to one another
[SPEAKER_02]: because not only are the amino acid
positions similar, but also the peptides
[SPEAKER_02]: found cross-linked were nearly identical,
differing by only a few amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found a cross-link between two
identical lysines found at position 179.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we know that this cross-link
had to occur between two adjacent CP
[SPEAKER_02]: monomers because this peptide only occurs
once in each molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call this kind of cross-link an
unambiguous homodimer, and this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most useful kind of cross-link for
modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cross-link was also perfectly
conserved in PLRV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we have some cross-linking
data, how do we use it for modeling?
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I used a tool called ITASR to
predict the structure of a single coat
[SPEAKER_02]: protein monomer by homology modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the structure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It consists of an S or shell domain,
which forms the surface of the capsid,
[SPEAKER_02]: and an R domain, which interacts with RNA
in the inside the capsid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, I model the multimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not computationally feasible to model
the entire virion, so instead we choose a
[SPEAKER_02]: subset.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, the coat protein trimer,
which is the basic unit of the capsid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The classical trimer makes up one face of
the virion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use SimDoc to assemble the monomer into
plausible trimmers in as many different
[SPEAKER_02]: ways as it can, while keeping my
cross-linked residues within a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: linear distance of each other based on the
length of the PIR cross-linking arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the distance constraints,
this analysis produces hundreds of models,
[SPEAKER_02]: but our cross-linking data narrows it down
to only 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I fed these 77 models into a
script, which calculates the shortest
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent accessible distance between the
cross-linked residues.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is important because linear distances
often pass through other parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: protein, which our cross-linker can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can think of this as the difference
between going from here to Australia by
[SPEAKER_02]: tunneling through the planet versus taking
an air plane over the planet's surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all of these calculations,
I ended up with two trimer models that fit
[SPEAKER_02]: our distance constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two models are shown here with
the cross-linking sites used for distance
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints, shown space-filled in
different colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we compare these to the most recent
PLRV trimer model from Stacey de Blasio's
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, we can see that model A is more
similar in shape, but still isn't an exact
[SPEAKER_02]: copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason we obtained two rather
different models for the trimer is that
[SPEAKER_02]: there are many different ways that
monomers contact each other in virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, these pink points are a
three-fold axis of symmetry at the center
[SPEAKER_02]: of the classical trimer, whereas the
yellow and green contacts occur at the
[SPEAKER_02]: vertices of the virion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our model changes depending on where in
the larger 3D structure we think the
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-links occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Model A, as well as Stacey's model,
fit best at the six-fold axis of symmetry,
[SPEAKER_02]: as shown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Model B, on the other hand, places the
cross-links at the three-fold axis of
[SPEAKER_02]: symmetry, making this a true trimer model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might remember earlier,
I mentioned this LH mutant from Stewart's
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that he tested by RNAase
protection and found that it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: stable virions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we highlight these mutated residues
on model A of the TYV trimer, we can make
[SPEAKER_02]: some predictions about why this might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two mutated residues are located
near the three-fold axis of symmetry in
[SPEAKER_02]: this model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is likely a really important area
for assembly and stability of the trimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, the histidine at position
108 has a positively charged side chain
[SPEAKER_02]: and is near a negatively charged aspartate
on the neighboring monomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mutating this histidine to proline,
which is hydrophobic, would greatly
[SPEAKER_02]: disrupt the salt bridge and favorable
interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just one example of how a
structural model can be used to bridge the
[SPEAKER_02]: gap between sequence and function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: The high degree of conservation of
structural cross-links between TYV and
[SPEAKER_02]: PLRV provides grounds for extension of
these data to other Polaroviruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is important because it allows us to
make structural predictions for
[SPEAKER_02]: Polarovirus species that don't yet have
well-developed toolboxes, including newly
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging species.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, of course, would like to be able
to confirm our predictions by solving some
[SPEAKER_02]: structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we're doing this in
collaboration with Josh Chappie,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's an expert in x-ray crystallography
and cryo-EM here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the audience today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I did some early work trying
to solve the structure of the PLRV virion
[SPEAKER_02]: by cryo-EM, but didn't have time to
overcome some of the technical
[SPEAKER_02]: difficulties we had early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh's lab is also trying to solve the
crystal structure of the structural
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl Schiltz, a grad student in Josh's
lab, is actually very close to solving the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of the coat protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is also working with Jenny Wilson,
who's a grad student in our lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: to solve the structure of part of the
read-through domain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results from this project have
been really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to hear more about them,
I would encourage you to look out for
[SPEAKER_02]: their papers or to try to visit one of
their seminars on campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, these PIR data are the
only measurements we have of structural
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins for Polaroviruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we expect these data will continue to
be important even as we get closer to
[SPEAKER_02]: solving the structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This paper is an example of a structure
which was obtained primarily through
[SPEAKER_02]: cryo-EM, but utilized cross-linking data
to resolve an area that was otherwise
[SPEAKER_02]: ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I move on, I want to mention one
more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although all of the virus-virus
interactions I've talked about so far have
[SPEAKER_02]: been between structural proteins encoded
by ORFs 3 and 5, PIR can also detect
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions with any other viral proteins
that are present in our crude virion
[SPEAKER_02]: purifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, my data set included two
cross-links between the TUIV coat protein
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lysine located in the peptidase
domain of the viral P1 polyprotein.
[SPEAKER_02]: This interaction has never been shown
before and is interesting because of a
[SPEAKER_02]: very old mystery in the Polarovirus field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an image of a western blot using
an antibody that recognizes structural
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: The far left lane contains crude protein
extracted from PLRV-infected plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that there's a clear band
visible for the coat protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a faint signal between 50 and
70 kD, which is hard to see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if we take this same plant tissue
and use it for a virion purification,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see a very different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The co-protein band remains as expected,
but the full-length read-through becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult or impossible to detect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, the faint bands we saw earlier
resolve into a handful of clear bands
[SPEAKER_02]: between 50 and 70 kD.
[SPEAKER_02]: These bands are believed to correspond to
truncated forms of the read-through
[SPEAKER_02]: protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many years, researchers weren't
certain whether these truncations were an
[SPEAKER_02]: artifact of the purification protocol or
whether they had some biological function.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this paper published in 2014
showed for the first time that the
[SPEAKER_02]: truncated RTP did have a function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Authors found that both the full-length
and truncated forms of the RTP were
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely required for efficient systemic
movement in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hypothesized that only the truncated
RTP is incorporated into virions,
[SPEAKER_02]: accounting for its enrichment in purified
preparations, but that unincorporated
[SPEAKER_02]: full-length RTP interacts with other host
proteins to facilitate movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the authors were not able to
determine how RTP truncation occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: My finding of a cross-link between the CP
or RTP and a lysine in the peptidase
[SPEAKER_02]: domain of another viral protein suggests
the polariviruses may perform this
[SPEAKER_02]: truncation using their own viral protease.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is supported by an analysis of the
locations of the putative P1 cleavage
[SPEAKER_02]: sites in the RTP of polariviruses,
as well as others in the family
[SPEAKER_02]: Ludioviridae.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the co-protein and N-terminal half of
the read-through domain, there are very
[SPEAKER_02]: few putative P1 cleavage sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we see a massive increase in the
frequency of these sites in the C-terminal
[SPEAKER_02]: half of the RTD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleavage at these sites would result in
truncated RTPs of 50 to 70 kilodaltons,
[SPEAKER_02]: which corresponds exactly with the sizes
that we see on a western.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this portion of the talk,
we found that these structural cross-links
[SPEAKER_02]: are conserved between PLRV and TUIV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a cross-link between a viral
protease domain and the co-protein,
[SPEAKER_02]: which led us to postulate a possible
mechanism for RTP truncation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we expect these data to be useful in
the future as we integrate them with
[SPEAKER_02]: crystal structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, I want to talk a little bit about
host-virus interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned previously, PIR can also be
used to probe host-virus interactions as
[SPEAKER_02]: these are preserved during our crude
virion purification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first joined the HEC lab,
Stacey de Blasio was working on this
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: She found interactions between PLRV
co-protein or read-through protein and 32
[SPEAKER_02]: different plant proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a protein called BIP, which is a heat
shock protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Stacey modeled the interaction
between BIP, which is shown in blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the PLRV co-protein, shown in green,
she found that the co-protein actually
[SPEAKER_02]: fits perfectly into BIP substrate binding
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you can see a web logo analyzing the
conservation of the BIP binding site among
[SPEAKER_02]: the co-proteins of other viruses in this
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: The size of the letter corresponds to the
degree of conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are the amino acids that are
directly involved in binding highly
[SPEAKER_02]: conserved, they're also exactly the same
motif that BIP is known to bind to in host
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins, indicating that this motif has
evolved in viruses to mimic the host
[SPEAKER_02]: substrates of BIP.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is especially interesting because
these residues are a short but highly
[SPEAKER_02]: conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino
acids in what is otherwise a highly
[SPEAKER_02]: charged region of the co-protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing this, we wanted to explore this
protein further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my first projects here was to
take this protein and a selection of
[SPEAKER_02]: others found interacting with PLRV and to
try to determine what the purpose of this
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, there's already a very
well-established system in place for gene
[SPEAKER_02]: silencing in Nicosiana benthamiana,
our plant of choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This system uses another virus,
tobacco rattle virus, or TRV, to silence
[SPEAKER_02]: genes by virus-induced gene silencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: After inserting a fragment of a plant
gene, like BIP, into one of the halves of
[SPEAKER_02]: the TRV genome, young plants are
inoculated by agro-infiltration.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the virus replicates, and moves
systemically, homologous transcripts are
[SPEAKER_02]: silenced in new tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we'd never tried this system before,
we chose a relatively simple approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I inoculated plants with TRV, containing a
silencing construct, and allowed them to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow for several weeks, as shown on the
previous slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I then inoculated several young leaves
with PLRV by agro-infiltration,
[SPEAKER_02]: waited a few days, and sampled the
infiltrated area by taking leaf punches to
[SPEAKER_02]: check titer by ELISA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this assay samples locally
infected tissue, we expect to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: assess changes in virion assembly,
virus replication, and host defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what we found when we used VIGS
to knock down BIP.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a graph of PLRV titer in the
control plants, which are infected with a
[SPEAKER_02]: version of TRV that shouldn't be silencing
anything, and the plants where BIP
[SPEAKER_02]: expression has been knocked down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that there isn't much of an
effect at three days post-infiltration,
[SPEAKER_02]: or DPI, however, just two days later,
PLRV titer has fallen in the control
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but risen in the BIP silenced
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tested 11 different host interactors in
this way, and found that knocking down
[SPEAKER_02]: eight of them affected titer during early
or late stages of local infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: In later PIR experiments, I also found two
cross-links that we had not seen before,
[SPEAKER_02]: between PLRV co-protein or read-through
protein, and a plant argonaut 1,
[SPEAKER_02]: or EGO 1 protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Stacey had previous evidence that
EGO 1 co-immunoprecipitates with PLRV,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was the first evidence we had of a
direct interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I go into the follow-up
experiments, I want to take a minute to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the role of EGO 1 in antiviral
defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants' primary defense against viruses is
RNA silencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: During replication of Polaroid viruses and
most other plant viruses, a
[SPEAKER_02]: double-stranded RNA version of the viral
genome is temporarily produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: This DSRNA can be recognized by plant
dicer proteins, which chop it into pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resulting fragments can be small
primary interfering RNAs, or siRNAs,
[SPEAKER_02]: 22 to 24 nucleotides long.
[SPEAKER_02]: These siRNAs are loaded into argonaut
proteins, including EGO 1, forming the
[SPEAKER_02]: RNA-induced silencing complex,
or RISC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This complex targets homologous
transcripts for silencing by a cleavage or
[SPEAKER_02]: translational inhibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: To combat this defense, most plant viruses
encode a silencing suppressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember from the very beginning of
my talk, the silencing suppressor protein
[SPEAKER_02]: for Polaroid viruses is called P0.
[SPEAKER_02]: P0 is actually believed to function by
preventing assembly of the RISC and
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting degradation of EGO 1 protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: This does not prevent generation of
primary siRNAs by dicer, but it does keep
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO 1 from using these siRNAs to target
other viral transcripts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on this information, we can
hypothesize that knocking down EGO 1 will
[SPEAKER_02]: increase PLRV titer.
[SPEAKER_02]: To test this, I came back to my VIGS
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this time I inoculated young
plants with TRV and PLRV at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: After two to three weeks, when both
viruses had moved systemically,
[SPEAKER_02]: I took leaf punches from young leaves and
assessed titer, again by Eliza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this approach assays systemically
infected tissue, it surveys a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of the virus life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I'm showing the effect of silencing
EGO 1 on PLRV titer at two different time
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each dot represents one leaf punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink dots are from the control plants
infected with TRV that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: silencing anything, whereas blue dots are
from plants infected with TRV targeting
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: While silencing EGO 1 did greatly increase
PLRV titer in some samples, you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was a huge amount of variation,
even between samples taken from the same
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the enormous variability
between samples, there was not a
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant difference
between the treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after seeing these data, I wanted to
see if I could alter my sampling method to
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I re-ran the previous experiment,
but this time I took three punches from
[SPEAKER_02]: the left half of the leaf, which I've
labeled as one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a box and whisker plot to show
variability, and here the control plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are in blue and the EGO 1 silenced plants
are in purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the variability is lower in
some areas of the leaf than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, I excised the midrib of the same
leaf as one sample and took the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: remaining right half of the leaf as
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that the titer in both of
these samples was pretty variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I took the petiole of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: PLRV titer was by far least variable in
these samples, and a clear difference
[SPEAKER_02]: could be seen between the treatments,
even though I'd sampled approximately the
[SPEAKER_02]: same number of plants as before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this in mind, I set out to do this
experiment one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time I took petiole samples,
and I also tripled the number of plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: each treatment because I really was tired
of doing this experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you can see that silencing EGO 1
significantly increased PLRV titer
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to the control plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also see that PLRV titer was
significantly more variable in the EGO 1
[SPEAKER_02]: silenced plants than in the controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember that we saw this in the
very first set of experiments I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also checked TRV titer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that silencing EGO 1 also
clearly increased TRV titer, which makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense given that EGO 1 has a role in
general antiviral defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, unlike PLRV, TRV titer was
similarly variable in the control and EGO
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 silenced plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This suggests to me that there's something
unique about the relationship between PLRV
[SPEAKER_02]: and EGO 1 beyond EGO 1's role in broad
spectrum virus defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I was incredibly happy to see
some low p-values after all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: optimization, I've actually saved what I
think is the most interesting result for
[SPEAKER_02]: last.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit hard to see in this
photo, but infection with TRV EGO 1 alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is without PLRV present, causes some
stunting and morphological defects.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't really surprising because EGO 1
is known to have a role in transcriptional
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation during development.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, these plants are still very
much alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: and will even eventually flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: PLRV infection, on the other hand,
causes very mild symptoms, even when our
[SPEAKER_02]: control version of TRV is present.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you combine TRV EGO 1 and PLRV
infection, the plant withers away and
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: To understand why this might occur,
we need to think about all the factors
[SPEAKER_02]: influencing EGO 1 levels in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO 1 protein is made by translation of
EGO 1 mRNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: When PLRV is present, it produces P0,
which promotes degradation of EGO 1
[SPEAKER_02]: protein to facilitate virus replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: TRV EGO 1 also works to knock down EGO 1,
but it does so at the transcript level.
[SPEAKER_02]: From this information, we can hypothesize
that TRV EGO 1 and PLRV individually knock
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO 1 down, but not out.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when both are combined,
EGO 1 drops to lethal levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is supported by work from other labs
showing that EGO 1 null mutants in
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidot opsis are lethal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this suggests that Polar viruses
must tightly control P0 activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knocking down EGO 1 increases virus titer,
but if you knock down too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: the host dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings me back around to the
cross-link between PLRV coat protein and
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if the purpose of this interaction is
to protect EGO 1 from P0?
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be an elegant way to maintain
EGO 1 homeostasis, as virus titer and
[SPEAKER_02]: likely production of P0 increase,
where CP is also produced to counteract
[SPEAKER_02]: P0's effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This hypothesis has mixed support from
qPCR data.
[SPEAKER_02]: The expression of EGO 1 is almost
identical in control plants, regardless of
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not the plants are co-infected
with PLRV, meaning that PLRV infection
[SPEAKER_02]: alone doesn't significantly disrupt EGO 1
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, PLRV infection has a noticeable
effect in plants infected with TRV
[SPEAKER_02]: targeting EGO 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, PLRV infection in these plants
increases EGO 1 expression, likely in an
[SPEAKER_02]: effort by the plant to compensate for P0's
effect at the protein level, although it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important to note that this increased
expression may not result in increased
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of EGO 1 protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this seems to contradict our
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The presence of the coat protein should
shield EGO 1 from P0, especially because
[SPEAKER_02]: we know from the previous data that the
titer is very high in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we already know that the coat protein
can't be 100% effective at preventing EGO
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 degradation, or there would be no point
to having P0 at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the plants are more sensitive to
even the reduced action of P0 when EGO 1
[SPEAKER_02]: is already knocked down at the transcript
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still working on testing this
hypothesis, but I think there are
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting implications for the data I
already have, regardless of how the next
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments turn out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knocking down EGO 1 affects PLRV titer in
a much more complex way than TRV titer,
[SPEAKER_02]: suggesting that there is something unique
about the EGO 1 polaroid virus
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also supported by the cross-link
we found between coat protein and EGO 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely have evidence that the
strength of P0 is a balancing act between
[SPEAKER_02]: suppressing host defense and killing the
host, and EGO 1 homeostasis is not
[SPEAKER_02]: affected by PLRV infection alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This led us to develop a hypothesis about
the function of the CP-EGO 1 interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this second half of the talk,
we've assessed the effect of knocking down
[SPEAKER_02]: some host interactors during PLRV
infection and developed a method to test
[SPEAKER_02]: these interactions using virus-induced
gene silencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found a direct interaction between
EGO 1 and PLRV co-protein or read-through
[SPEAKER_02]: protein, and we've seen evidence that
polaroid viruses must modulate P0 activity
[SPEAKER_02]: to prevent host death.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I know I just gave you six years'
worth of data in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to wrap things up by reiterating
what I think are the main findings of this
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first part of the talk,
we found that the interaction topologies
[SPEAKER_02]: of polaroid virus co-proteins are
conserved, which sounds relatively trivial
[SPEAKER_02]: but is actually really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the co-protein interactions
don't change between polaroid virus
[SPEAKER_02]: species with different hosts, this means
that these species-specific differences
[SPEAKER_02]: are not encoded in the co-protein
topologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since polaroid viruses move as virions in
plants, we can highlight and hypothesize
[SPEAKER_02]: that host specificity must then be encoded
in the read-through domain by the process
[SPEAKER_02]: of elimination.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also demonstrated for the first time
that PIR successfully identifies direct,
[SPEAKER_02]: functionally relevant interactions between
polaroid viruses and their hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also not trivial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew of very few direct host virus
interactions previously, and finding these
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions was a matter of luck or
screening using yeast-to-hybrid or other
[SPEAKER_02]: high-throughput approaches, which are very
time- and resource-intensive, and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: always identify interactions that are
functionally relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only have we found many new host
interactions to explore, but we've also
[SPEAKER_02]: made a huge technological leap forward in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I didn't show all of the data for
this, but in my big experiments,
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that knocking out most of the host
proteins that we identified as interacting
[SPEAKER_02]: with polaroid viruses by PIR actually
increased polaroid virus titer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a really surprising result
because we were expecting to find at least
[SPEAKER_02]: an equal number of interactions that are
important for virus replication or
[SPEAKER_02]: movement as for defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of ways that we can
explain this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible that plants really just
throw everything that they have at viruses
[SPEAKER_02]: to try to prevent replication,
and so most host virus interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: actually represent the plant's attempts to
defend itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alternatively, we know that the
circulative transmission mode of polaroid
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses requires prolonged aphid feeding
for acquisition and transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: While it's beneficial for viruses with
other transmission modes to sacrifice
[SPEAKER_02]: their hosts in an effort to produce as
many virions as possible, polaroid viruses
[SPEAKER_02]: must keep their hosts alive and attractive
to aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the reason we see an increase in
titer when we knock out most host
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction partners is because the
function of these interactions is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: to limit virus replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: To wrap things up real quick, I want to
talk briefly about some potential future
[SPEAKER_02]: applications and impacts for this
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really interested to see how these
data could be applied to other non-model
[SPEAKER_02]: polaroid virus species, including some of
the newer emerging viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: These types of data could also be useful
for the development of interdiction
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules, which are molecules
specifically designed to interfere with
[SPEAKER_02]: the biological process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela Cruz, a grad student in our lab,
is actually working on the development of
[SPEAKER_02]: interdiction molecules to prevent
transmission of the bacteria that causes
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus screening disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like to learn more about that,
then you can look for her papers and
[SPEAKER_02]: seminars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that this technology has some
potentially interesting applications for
[SPEAKER_02]: gene editing, and particularly in the
development of resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a paper from 2011 detailing the
development of potato cultivars resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: to three strains of potato virus Y,
which is a podi virus that's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important potato pathogens today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like polaroid viruses, PBY has a
single-stranded RNA genome and encodes a
[SPEAKER_02]: viral genome-leaked protein, or VPG,
which binds to the five prime end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: viral genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: VPG then binds to a host elongation
factor, in this case, EIF4E, to recruit a
[SPEAKER_02]: host ribosomal complex to initiate
production of viral proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Previous screens had identified EIF4E
alleles in other plant species,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were fully functional, but contained
small polymorphisms that prevented binding
[SPEAKER_02]: to VPG, conferring resistance to podi
viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this study, the authors used targeted
mutagenesis to transfer those
[SPEAKER_02]: polymorphisms into potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resulting transgenic lines are
numbered here on this graph with the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: type and other control lines on the far
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that all of the transgenic
lines were almost completely resistant to
[SPEAKER_02]: all three tested strains of PBY,
whereas the controls were highly
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that PIR-guided modeling has the
potential to achieve the same end result
[SPEAKER_02]: for polaroid viruses, but in a much
shorter time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have already established that PIR
successfully identifies functionally
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant host virus interactions,
which is the first step in developing a
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance strategy like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also use PIR data to model the
interaction between the host and viral
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins, predicting where the viral
protein binds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this binding site is located in an area
that can be mutated without affecting the
[SPEAKER_02]: host protein's native function,
we can perform gene editing to knock out
[SPEAKER_02]: the interaction without affecting the
protein's native function.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is especially important because many
of the host proteins we found interacting
[SPEAKER_02]: with PLRV and TUIV have important roles in
metabolism and development and can't be
[SPEAKER_02]: knocked down or out without causing
significant and sometimes lethal effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we finally have the ability to
more directly explore structural biology
[SPEAKER_02]: and protein-protein interactions,
we can try to tackle some of the oldest
[SPEAKER_02]: and most important questions in luteovirid
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do polaroid viruses interact with
their hosts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we interrupt virus replication or
movement?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the structure of the polaroid virus
virion and what governs its assembly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we design molecules to prevent
assembly or disrupt host virus
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do polaroid viruses cause symptoms and
yield losses in host plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we use this information to reduce the
impact of these viruses?
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, aphid transmission is largely
a black box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Application of PIR to aphid virus
complexes could greatly help us to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the circulative transmission of
these and other viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, I think these data and this
technology are really exciting and give us
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to leap years ahead in our
understanding of polaroid virus biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I've convinced you of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I take questions, I'd like to take
just like one minute to thank a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who have made all of this
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been fortunate to have many
amazing mentors in my time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My advisor, Michelle Heck, has been a
constant source of support and
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who has met her knows that her
seemingly endless energy and capacity to
[SPEAKER_02]: generate new ideas is truly incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from Cold Spring Harbor to many
government shutdowns, we've been through a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so grateful to have been able to
take this journey with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank my committee,
all of whom are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so honored to have been able to
have their feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Stacey de Blasio laid the foundation
for so much of this work and has been an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible sounding board friend and
teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could not have done any of this
without her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my many other mentors who have
helped me to become a better scientist,
[SPEAKER_02]: a better teacher, and a better
communicator, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everyone says this, but I truly
have the best collaborators in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only Jim Stewart and Josh,
who I mentioned previously, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: Veronique Brault and Veronique
Siegler-Graff, who enabled all of the work
[SPEAKER_02]: with TUIV.
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband, Dave, has been my rock through
even the hardest days in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only has he been unwaveringly
supportive and encouraging, but he has
[SPEAKER_02]: personally contributed to this project
through many late nights helping me
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculate plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also not be here today without my
family, especially my sister Midori and my
[SPEAKER_02]: parents, pictured here in their adorable
Christmas attire, who have been a constant
[SPEAKER_02]: source of strength, inspiration,
and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are the best, and I'm so lucky to
have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I'm so grateful to have met so
many brilliant, kind, and creative people
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I especially want to thank Angela
Cruz, who has had the misfortune of
[SPEAKER_02]: spending so much time with me that we've
started taking on one another's
[SPEAKER_02]: mannerisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's picked me back up so many times
after I've fallen, and I truly don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I would do without her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, all of you, for your support
and for listening today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, I think we have time
for a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start by taking a question from
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like this AGO hypothesis about
the co-protein kind of modulating
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of AGO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you showed in your model, or you
showed your data that says if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: big knockdown plant that's inoculated with
the virus, you see this like dead plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're saying that that could be due
to AGO going below the threshold for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think would happen if you
overexpressed the co-protein or try to
[SPEAKER_00]: play with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Andy was talking about this AGO1 story
and my hypothesis for the co-protein
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction protecting AGO1 from p0,
and was wondering if maybe if we
[SPEAKER_02]: overexpressed the co-protein or did
something else to kind of mess with this
[SPEAKER_02]: system, if we could maybe provide some
support for this hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually is something that I'm
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using something called a silencing
suppression assay, which I just barely
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get done in time for this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically I'm trying to see if I can
overexpressed the co-protein and see a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in how well AGO1 is degraded by
p0.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you showed this sort of proteolysis of
your RTD with the viral protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how that maps to our
structural data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like does it correspond to where we see
structurally, or does it line up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where we have a structure?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have looked at that, and I can't
remember what the results were.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be really interesting to
check to see where those putative cleavage
[SPEAKER_02]: sites are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cleavage sites are in the center of
the RTD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you showed a distribution,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it drops off very strongly at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, we have a structure of the
internal part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that map to where that drops off,
and what we know, what we need for the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it would also be interesting
to see whether the putative cleavage sites
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do see in the NRTD are maybe
protected in the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they could be present,
but aren't being recognized by p1,
[SPEAKER_02]: which could explain why we never see
cleavage there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions from Geneva or
other remote audiences?
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if anyone has any other questions,
feel free to come and grab me afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
