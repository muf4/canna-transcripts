[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm primarily a vegetable grower
and been working with covered crops for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost three decades and so today I'm
going to talk about kind of a pastiche of
[SPEAKER_00]: different techniques that I've used on my
farm for different reasons and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really the idea is is how on a intensively
managed vegetable cropping operation can
[SPEAKER_00]: you fit cover crops into where those
vegetable crops are grown and and for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself personally I didn't start I didn't
grow up on a farm I grew up in suburbia in
[SPEAKER_00]: central Illinois and I didn't go to school
university and that and agriculture or
[SPEAKER_00]: even science for that matter I was English
and Asian lit major and so I really got
[SPEAKER_00]: into agriculture by by reading reading
poetry really and so I thought there'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice to start off with appropriate poem
which talks about cover crops really frost
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding by Wendell Berry and it seems
appropriate now even though this is dated
[SPEAKER_00]: February 2nd 1968 in the dark of the moon
in flying snow in the dead of winter war
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading families dying in the world
danger I walked the rocky hillside sowing
[SPEAKER_00]: clover so Wendell here is frost seeding
clover and probably has a nice heavy clay
[SPEAKER_00]: soil which frost seeding works much better
on than the farm where most of my farming
[SPEAKER_00]: experience came from southern New
Hampshire and that where we had a sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: loam everybody today has been talking
about all the beneficial effects of cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and green manures and just kind of
reiterate some of them is the allopathic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on the weed seed bank interruption
of pests and disease cycles elevated
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial activity in soils positive
effect on soil moisture conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: legume family fix anywhere from 50 to 300
pounds of nitrogen per acre and the
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive capability of cover crops for
beneficial and pollinating insects and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course addition of organic matter to your
soil to promote soil health so I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start with some profiles of
different cover crops on that and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are really very common used in the upper
north northeast winter rye or winter rye
[SPEAKER_00]: in combination with hairy vetch and run
through some photographs where I've farmed
[SPEAKER_00]: in southern New Hampshire up to midcoast
Maine there's ideal windows for getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these cover crops as Thomas was
definitely talking about with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops he was talking about and
winter rye there is a pretty long period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time that you can get your rye on from
late August all the way into about now if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to gamble a little bit but the
window is much shorter for hairy vetch and
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that really mid-august to
mid-september is the ideal time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that vetch in and especially in
combination with your winter rye and these
[SPEAKER_00]: two in combination over winter really well
the kill time or termination time for rye
[SPEAKER_00]: would be very early in the spring if you
can get into the fields and with the
[SPEAKER_00]: tillering stage or allow it to get to full
maturity and add to the pollen stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: then mow it at the pollen stage and with
the vetch component in that and with
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage and there is a lot of tillage with
the vegetable crop rotations and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization they'll come off the rye
and vetch will you know feed most of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crops from mid-summer into into later
in the fall so it's a great great setup
[SPEAKER_00]: crop another use of of winter rye it
catches really nicely with just soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in that and so for fall kind of
widely spaced single row or crops there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a great opportunity to get rye into
your field while you're still growing your
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crop in this case broccoli
transplanted in August and the rye is just
[SPEAKER_00]: spun on in mid-september it's critical
that you're your broccoli planting is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean from weeds and that but you don't
need to press it in or or cultivate it in
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you can just spin it on with the
moisture and that you can get a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good catch on most years broccoli will
continue and the growth slows down in that
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded area where the where the broccoli
is and then much later after broccoli has
[SPEAKER_00]: been cut off and in this case this field
was much too wet to get in there with
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing that have a nice stand of
winter rye to get you through the winter I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned this trick from Thomas from his
website and that and that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes that you have a field where you
didn't get a cover crop in and in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in the winter it's bare it could be
weedy and you schedule something that
[SPEAKER_00]: would go in there say and and in June that
that kind of bare window of time it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great time to put down some cheap seed
like rye and you'll flush some annual
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds through that you'll kind of
stimulate the microbial soil life and that
[SPEAKER_00]: with that rye and and also it will be
scavenging some leftover nitrogen in that
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can use this rye is really like a
starter fertilizer the trick is not to let
[SPEAKER_00]: it get very much growth four to six inches
and then the tillage don't need aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage in that it's used the perfecta to
pass the perfecta the field was ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and then I was able to transplant
summer summer squash and and and winter
[SPEAKER_00]: squash and this little block here but to
basically use it as a bio stimulant and
[SPEAKER_00]: and a weed suppressant for many years I've
worked with the idea of of strips with
[SPEAKER_00]: over wintered rye or over wintered rye and
vetch and and instead of using a crimper
[SPEAKER_00]: nap which will kind of kill your rye and
vetch nap but the ground stays kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool the crimper most of my farm
experience is a little further north in
[SPEAKER_00]: the northeast and that I want that soil to
warm up in that for what I intend to put
[SPEAKER_00]: into these strips and that so I I would
with a spader early in the spring cut
[SPEAKER_00]: strips in my field of over wintered rye
and vetch and then is able to direct seed
[SPEAKER_00]: winter squash or pumpkins in the
alternating strips but strips are wide
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that that soil gets warm before I
put the seed in and I let the rye vetch
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow so I'm getting a fair
amount of biomass and straw mulch from
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then then at that termination
time which is the the winter rye in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen stage and vetch beginning to flower
this case is probably a little up far
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced and that mow it down and you have
a nice straw between your between your
[SPEAKER_00]: beds of winter squash or pumpkins and
still able to cultivate the pumpkins the
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds warm there and then and then kind
of refine in this technique if I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a fall cover crop in a field that's
very hard to get a cover crop in when at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time with the squash and pumpkins
would come off in mid late September in
[SPEAKER_00]: that using the kind of establishing living
mulch strips of medium red clover and so
[SPEAKER_00]: just at the stage of where the tendrils
start to move out on the pumpkin plants
[SPEAKER_00]: here and that movement is very quick I'll
do a shallow tillage and then drop clover
[SPEAKER_00]: seed in it's very important that there's
moisture the soil to get good germination
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Colipacker press that seed in it'll
germinate different fields same thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the broad leaves from the pumpkins or
winter squash and that shade that clover
[SPEAKER_00]: so the shape the clover doesn't really
interfere with the growth of the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: squash in that and then as the squash and
pumpkins comes out of the field in that
[SPEAKER_00]: very important to get it out of the field
as quickly as you can mow off that that
[SPEAKER_00]: crop residue and that so the the clover
strips can get light and then here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall I'm you know I get my my fall cover
crop established but it was seeded back in
[SPEAKER_00]: July and with the liberation of light to
the clover in that then it'll fill in this
[SPEAKER_00]: fill in the field and that different field
here is butternut same thing the
[SPEAKER_00]: butternuts come out strips are there and
here we are in November and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: clover has filled in the field and then
next spring yet you know really nice clean
[SPEAKER_00]: stand of clover on getting the nitrogen
that's coming off that clover and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flip families and that so I'm using
it establish them with the curcumin family
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll cut strips in that field of red
clover and I'm transplanting tomatoes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hard to see the tomato plants are
very small in this slide and and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of changing plant families
and I use the clover as a straw mulch for
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomatoes Johnny's you know they were a
little hesitant to see some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques brought on to their farm so
you're just kind of like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: refinement this technique this is last
spring in that on field there a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop residue we've got the plastic out and
and basically Harold the field marked
[SPEAKER_00]: marked all my beds and then any bed that I
was going to have in plastic plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: whoops plastic mulch I seeded seeded all
in any strips to oats and in medium medium
[SPEAKER_00]: red clover the oats is a nurse crop for
the clover use the cauliflower pack it in
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I continue with the spot
transplanting in the areas that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to that are in the plastic mulch in
that as those crops are available and then
[SPEAKER_00]: manage the by mowing it and also you're
flushing a lot of the annual weed seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: for the clover so it's a technique you're
managing your weed seed bank with the
[SPEAKER_00]: clover and again there's no bare soil here
there's no bare soil cultivation that but
[SPEAKER_00]: the clover is not interfering with you
know your cash crop in this place in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case eggplant and then here we are early
October taking the plastic out not easy
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's really not an easy way to
get that plastic out in this case I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using biotel what and other fields are
using kind of non biotel kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional plastic mulch but getting
that plastic out and then with with the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and that migrates in and so there's
no fault tillage and you have a good stand
[SPEAKER_00]: of clover in that in that field and then
modification of this in tomatoes this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny's and that same thing basically
start off with a bare soil seed your your
[SPEAKER_00]: oats and medium red clover and then here
we're using straw mulch instead of plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is straw mulch that we had bailed
at our farm and first the clover notes are
[SPEAKER_00]: established and then we transplant the
tomatoes and the bare soil important for
[SPEAKER_00]: that bare soil to be warm so the soil can
warm up where we are and then then bring
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the mulch into the tomato plants
here you can see the straw mulch with the
[SPEAKER_00]: with the clover strips and then management
again with mowing in that so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing our annual weeds through there
but what I liked about this with the straw
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch instead of the plastic with the
plastic we'd have a little weed kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: weed strip right on that edge and that and
created a kind of a challenge for managing
[SPEAKER_00]: those weeds on that strip but with the
with the straw mulch and that I I could
[SPEAKER_00]: dry my tractor tire onto that onto that
straw and and I you know the management of
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds and that and that field with the
straw instead of the plastic and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenally faster just run that more
through there it can run it right up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the straw and have a nice airflow good
harvest aisles for the tomatoes and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so they would you know have a
well-established field and then and then
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall take out the stakes and the
string tomatoes mow it and and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have kind of straw and I found that the I
didn't get the the migration of the clover
[SPEAKER_00]: into the straw it really seemed to impede
a little bit I think if we use less straw
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably get better migration of it
but point is is that a nice cover going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the winter and good stands of clover
and then this this year we planted our
[SPEAKER_00]: winter squash and pumpkin nursery into
those clover strips without any additional
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer and that and had a you know on
a hundred day crop and that had very good
[SPEAKER_00]: crops of pumpkins and and winter squash
from the clover that was established the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous year but you know the key is that
there is almost no tillage for two years
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost no bare soil for two years once
you do the initial setup of the field in
[SPEAKER_00]: that also works well on you know crops
like some flowers cut flowers again we're
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing annual weeds through the clover
just wider spacing and after a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: mowings the in that case the amaranth is
gone I found this technique works really
[SPEAKER_00]: well for a gallon soga I've read that the
gallon soga seed has a very short-term
[SPEAKER_00]: viability about a year and a half and so
if you have fields that are infested with
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon soga if you can shut off all kind
of cultivation and tillage for two seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really blow a hole in your weed
seed bank of viable gallon soga seed so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use this technique with the clover
in that the gallon soga will just it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: head out just above the clover and so you
just mow it you just clip off those heads
[SPEAKER_00]: do it four or five times and then there
you know then you can you know there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: no gallon soga in that field plus all the
weeds I mean the the clover seed and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry the the gallon soga seed that's in
the soil and that is breaking down in that
[SPEAKER_00]: so it this is a great technique to
eliminate gallon soga on a vegetable farm
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a problem in a lot of vegetable
farms induced by all that cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: bare soil another way just to think about
cover crops is how to fit them in and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually turn cover crops into cash a
cash crop a valuable cash crop so for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years I've utilized field peas as a as a
summer fallow nurse with oats just spin it
[SPEAKER_00]: on three to one kind of three three parts
of field peas to one part oats I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: trials of about 15 varieties of field peas
and I'm looking for a tender and juicy and
[SPEAKER_00]: and non powdery mildew deceptible variety
of field peas and that and and maximum at
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny's is one variety I find that works
very well and many varieties that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work so well and and after about four
weeks of growth with the field peas when
[SPEAKER_00]: they first come out the shoots are tough
so they need to have enough growth and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that that with your finger you can snap
them when they snap and that then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: tender and it's a great stir-fry green
it's very popular in Asian cuisine also a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of new American chefs you used to
sell to 35 restaurants and so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting nine ten dollars a pound for the
pea shoots for the restaurant trade but it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the only thing I sold straight
wholesale market terminal Chelsea market
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal to a broker the market terminal I
was getting 450 a pound for my broker
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I was selling you know from 40
to 80 cases a week through the market
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal and so I would stagger my
seedings of field peas and oats to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: extend my my supply of the field peas and
oats for that cash crop value as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all the benefits of having this
foul feel of you know tillage weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression you'd get off that build up of
organic matter and also the nitrogen that
[SPEAKER_00]: come off the field peas and that as the
maximum right there are a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of field peas and that you know
that the the flowers are different colors
[SPEAKER_00]: and that I found the chefs really like the
purple flower you got off the maximum and
[SPEAKER_00]: also just use that little little point
where the flower is in that and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: add that in my salad mix he was a great
bulking agent for the salad mix and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pea flower has a beautiful pea flavor and
I was getting in a clam shell 50 count pea
[SPEAKER_00]: blossoms for $20 a clam shell and selling
many hundreds of pounds I mean how many
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of dollars of value off those pea
blossoms also as white flowers some
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that's kind of the that's the
length of the pea shoot and then if I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to extend that season you could use
it for just get one flower flush and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have cash crops come on the backside of
field peas and oats or you could double up
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and designate the whole field for
a whole season and that and so a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the acreage that's what I would do I would
let the oats and the field peas mature but
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't have to be combined mature
just just start to have a bit of a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: coat to it and then I would mow it I use
the spader one pass of the spader which is
[SPEAKER_00]: a less aggressive tillage tool but you
know it is it still is a tillage tool for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain so that's one pass of the spader
get that residue into the ground you need
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to sprout it so you do it with
rain whoops or with irrigation and then
[SPEAKER_00]: here's your second flush later in August
and then you have another another round
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the fall of your pea shoots and
that as well as all that biomass very dry
[SPEAKER_00]: last year two years of Johnny's so
definitely had to irrigate it in midsummer
[SPEAKER_00]: there it is a Johnny's really nice flush
back in August and then then that will
[SPEAKER_00]: winter kill if we have mild you know if
you have a mild fall in that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want the oats and that second flush to set
mature seed in that so you might mow it
[SPEAKER_00]: down as that oat seed if it's a little
juicy you want to mow it down before it
[SPEAKER_00]: hardens up and that so you don't have a
problem with that as a volunteer the next
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and then I found that I used a much
less aggressive tillage after the field
[SPEAKER_00]: pea and oak residue and that kind of got
wet and and soft and that through the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and that very easy to work for
early spring crops and that with no
[SPEAKER_00]: additional fertilization other than you
know adjusting for pH and that and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my direct seeded crops my following spring
would come off of the field pea and oak
[SPEAKER_00]: fell Sudan grass just a great builder of
organic matter and a weed suppressant I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see the thick I'm broadcasted but
you can just see drill what I found is
[SPEAKER_00]: that if I let the Sudan grass get the full
maturity in that it's so stocky and
[SPEAKER_00]: lignite it's hard to break it down through
the winter the next year and that so I
[SPEAKER_00]: would mow it three times not let it get
any higher than waist-high and also it
[SPEAKER_00]: would I find that it would the root mass
and that would get thicker from that
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing in that you'd have you know no
weeds in that understory of the Sudan
[SPEAKER_00]: grass and then sometimes I wanted to with
this this summer foul and that get a
[SPEAKER_00]: clover established in the backside and so
just before my third mowing I would drop
[SPEAKER_00]: medium red clover seed into the Sudan
grass and then mow it so that the residue
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a mulch and then here's just my
first year I get it and that you know part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field I just did a straight Sudan
grass let it winter kill and other part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field I did this technique and now
I've used I've used it up in Johnnys it
[SPEAKER_00]: works really well on if you have kind of
dry sandy soils in that that mulch in that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a nice kind of nurse material for that
clover underneath it and that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have a nice stand of clover they'll
take you into the next next spring
[SPEAKER_00]: buckwheat Thomas talked about that it's
just it's a great great interruption
[SPEAKER_00]: summer cover crop great smother crop it's
also really good for harboring beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects bees and otherwise and so I would
always in fields of this case Brussels
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouts but in Nebraska fields that every
20th bed in that I would put a bed of of
[SPEAKER_00]: buckwheat stagger those beds and they
would be insectiaries and had to bring my
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials in I found that there is a
predator wasp that likes to crackle in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of imported cabbage worm in that and
so if you have these little stands of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering buckwheat in that it's a great
attractant for bringing in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: these wasps in that that really can knock
out your cabbage worms in that also
[SPEAKER_00]: they're great great crop for honeybees Kim
Stoner and the Connecticut Experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: Station that has done a lot of work on
evaluating different cover crops and what
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects they bring in and this
is kind of a hard slide to read in that
[SPEAKER_00]: but the point of it is is that she was
looking at honeybees and in bumblebees
[SPEAKER_00]: bumblebees build their nests in the ground
so ground tillage and that disturbance and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to take that native bee out
of your off your farm and that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: honeybees of course you know they were
managing honeybees with your beehives and
[SPEAKER_00]: that but not all flowering cover crops are
going to attract the the same same insect
[SPEAKER_00]: in that so for medium red clover in that
it's attractive to bumblebees but not
[SPEAKER_00]: honeybees and as opposed to say buckwheat
is is attractive to honeybees but not
[SPEAKER_00]: bumblebees and there are few of these
flowering cover crops like white clover
[SPEAKER_00]: that attracted to both honeybees and
bumblebees so it's kind of like know your
[SPEAKER_00]: bees and know your cover crop and you can
use them to bring in something into your
[SPEAKER_00]: into your fields and buckwheat is great
it's really easy to knock down I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like buckwheat is a setup for fall carrots
and that to really clean your soil up for
[SPEAKER_00]: direct seeded carrots and that it's just a
great setup crop for that and and again I
[SPEAKER_00]: found that if I'm not going to put a fall
crop in the backside of a buckwheat in
[SPEAKER_00]: that just before you mow that flowering
buckwheat down if you can drop medium red
[SPEAKER_00]: clover down then mow it then run a coli
packer over it you get a nice stand of
[SPEAKER_00]: clover taking into the into the fall
equipment in that for cover crops it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good that you know you want to match up
the widths of your implements to your bed
[SPEAKER_00]: widths and that so you can work with these
strips and that it's also important that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to set aside cropland to
cover crops and that you know it they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not you know run by automatic piling that
you need to manage them irrigation is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to be able to kind of mitigate
drop stress on cover crops and so you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about that and you know and so
that there's a commitment to getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops in not as an afterthought so
all my equipment will kind of match up for
[SPEAKER_00]: my purposes of using cover crops in that
and the bed widths of my tractors I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: an implement that I brought into Johnny's
that was a discovery for me it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: stony soil for a lot of the fields we have
there so like a spader would not work well
[SPEAKER_00]: there for cutting strips and so this is
kind of like a hybrid perfected in that
[SPEAKER_00]: but instead of having those s-tying sweeps
and that it has two gangs of discs then
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the the rakes and the roller bar
in the back but it's great for cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: strips if you get in there early and makes
a nice level seed bed and also it's a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: nice bed to also be laying plastic on all
kinds of implements for seeding and that
[SPEAKER_00]: from you know fertilizers spreaders to
seed drills we do a lot of receding just
[SPEAKER_00]: by by hand seeders nothing wrong with that
it's a nice field that was seeded with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drill but when I'm using the seed
drill and spin on you know almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'm putting cover crops on because I
really want to get a good catch in that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a Colipacker on the back side I
need that Colipacker in the back side just
[SPEAKER_00]: a good guarantee that you get good seed to
soil contact and and you want to seed with
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture either either moisture is coming
or there's good moisture in the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a good stand you do not want to seed
in kind of desert dry conditions that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe for a disaster with with cover
crops and just pictures of cover you can
[SPEAKER_00]: buy Colipackers without without seed seed
