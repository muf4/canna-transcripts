[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to be examining the
physical properties of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we mentioned before, most of soils
are made up of three particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, which is the largest size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt, which is a very small size of sand,
if you can think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clay, which is the very smallest size
particle, which is wafered and cannot see
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way those particles come together,
sand, silt and clay, gives us a texture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture is actually the percentage of
sand, silt and clay in any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why this is important is that the way the
particles come together give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: porosity, the amount of pore space that
allow water to move in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this demonstration is aimed at
showing you how water moves in different
[SPEAKER_00]: textures, if you like, of soil using
sponges as proxies for soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, this kitchen sponge,
it's got pore space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got air, which is a good proxy for
soil, which is about 50% solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% water and 25% air in an idealized
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use these sponges with different
pore sizes to tell us how water moves in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do here first is take
this kitchen sponge and put it underwater
[SPEAKER_00]: and squeeze all the air out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll let it open underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll bring it up into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point where there's no more air in
the sponge but just water is called
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturation is when all the pores are
filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, as soon as I bring it out
of the water, it starts to drain,
[SPEAKER_00]: drained by a gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity is pulling the water from the
sponge down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got plenty of water in the
sponge, but even though gravity is still
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's not being able to pull more
water from the sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, if we could assume that
these drips are stopped, we call that
[SPEAKER_00]: field capacity, which is the amount of
water a soil can hold against gravity,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically hold within its pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have basically this is field
capacity now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, most of the water is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free water is gone by gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean free water is the water in the
big pores, which are called macropores,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are free to move by gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water in the small pores, called
micropores, are being holding onto that
[SPEAKER_00]: water so that they're not able to be taken
away by gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I say let's just say this is field
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amount of water this sponge or
this soil can hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to say, well, now it's able for
the roots to get that water from the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pretend I'm a root,
but I'm just going to squeeze the sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a root getting the water from the
sponge, which would be by osmosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're just pretending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just squeezing the sponge until I
can't really squeeze any more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still plenty of water in this
sponge, as you could all imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's held so tightly by the pores that
roots are not able to get that water by
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, we call this the
permanent wilting point, where the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: has water in it, but it's held so tightly
that roots cannot get the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between field capacity, which is after
gravity drains water, turns the free water
[SPEAKER_00]: away, and where I squeeze the water and
you cannot get any more water off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge, we call that the available water
holding capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount of water any particular
soil, and it varies from soil to soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: can hold against gravity and was holding
so tightly in the pores that roots can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different soils have different
available water holding capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take this other sponge
here, which is a yellow big, really big
[SPEAKER_00]: pore sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this sponge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more open than the orange
sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to open it under water again as
I did with the orange sponge, squeeze all
[SPEAKER_00]: the air out, let the water fill the pores,
and I'm going to see what the so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: water is coming out by gravity than the
orange sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's lots of big pores which
allow gravity to pull that water down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small pores hold the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big pores allow the water to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I were to squeeze this sponge,
there's not very much water that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually left in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the available water holding
capacity of this sponge would be much less
[SPEAKER_00]: than this sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is there still water left in the
sponge after I squeeze it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of the forces of adhesion
and cohesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohesion is the attractiveness of water to
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water tends to bead up when it's on a
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adhesion is the attractiveness of a
solid surface to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is critical when you have small
pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of forces of adhesion holding
the water in the pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get further and further from a
solid surface, like in a big pore,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is then able to move via
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the forces of adhesion are being
overwhelmed by the fact that the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: further away from the solid surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to look at some different
types of sponges to see what kind of water
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity we can actually measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three sponges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a kitchen sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a kitchen sponge like the orange
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the yellow one like the very
big pore one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a white sponge which has very,
very small pores in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of tried to cut them so they're
equal volume because that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: More volume, more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do the same thing we did
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to squeeze the sponge
underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with the kitchen sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it come out underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the amount of water that's being
drained via gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big pores are basically just letting
their water go through the sponge until we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to a point where water is being held
so tightly in the sponge that gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot pull it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again, if you recall, this is
field capacity where free water is drained
[SPEAKER_00]: away by gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the water in the big pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's left is water in the smaller
pores which is being held by adhesion,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the adhesive forces against gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's measure what, let's see,
let's get this out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure what was held in that sponge until
I can't squeeze it anymore against
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's called the available
water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make it slightly pink so
you can see it in the graduated cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see we have 90 milliliters of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's look at the other sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can predict if that orange sponge has
really big pores that most of the water
[SPEAKER_00]: will be moved by gravity and we wouldn't
have as much held by adhesion after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll see because this is science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to squeeze the orange sponge
underwater, let it fill all the pores with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then we're going to let it
drain by gravity until we have no more
[SPEAKER_00]: water draining by gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the water in the sponge is
held by the adhesive forces of a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: surface to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to squeeze this sponge which
has the biggest pores into this tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to color it so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take this other graduated cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pour the water into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see that the available water
holding capacity is much less because the
[SPEAKER_00]: big pores are allowing water to move by
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have about 60 milliliters of
water here versus we had 90 in the medium
[SPEAKER_00]: size, the sponge with more pores,
more smaller pores I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the third sponge is this very tight,
very small, poured sponge which I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to squeeze underwater and let all the air
out, let the pores fill with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to, so very little
actually is pulled by gravity because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pores are very small holding the water
to their solid surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how much water this sponge
holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would predict that this would be
the one that has the most water holding
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity because all those small pores are
holding water very tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're at 120 milliliters of water
for the sponge with the very small pores
[SPEAKER_00]: or the soil with very small pores which is
a clay or silty soil where you can say
[SPEAKER_00]: that the green sponge would be more like a
sandy loam, had more sand in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pores and the orange sponge would
have mostly like a sand, have very little
[SPEAKER_00]: water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is doing is telling us how these
soils act in regards to water,
[SPEAKER_00]: water movement and water retention in
terms of what the plant's going to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: available water holding capacity.
