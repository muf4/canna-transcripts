[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody, this is Solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out at my winter pea trial plot and
I'm going to do some spring ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the group of ratings that we've
timed for spring green up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is spring green up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you go, oh my gosh, the world is
green again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that happened here about 10 days ago,
but I waited because we got a couple 20
[SPEAKER_00]: degree nights last week and I wanted to
make sure that we didn't see any further
[SPEAKER_00]: damage after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard from some of you,
especially in the upper Midwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had no survival for the winter
peas in your trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also pretty common when we have open
winters or winters that are very cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with little to no snow cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still important to record those no
survival ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps us establish a baseline for
survival of commercial cultivars and the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of places where your trials are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a bummer not to see anything in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here with my handy dandy rubric to
help me with my ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with winter survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a one for winter survival and zero to
20% survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did have total winter kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the rating you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five is the best rating.
That's 80 to 100% survival.
The downfall with this type of rating is
that you have to remember what your stand
looked like in the fall.
So maybe you have some photos to remind
you what those plots looked like.
So age as best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What percent of the plot that was there in
the fall still remains in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my plots, I had really nice winter
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely winter damage, which we'll talk
about in a moment, but you'll see that my
[SPEAKER_00]: plots look pretty full of nice green pea
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to give these all five.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely all survived at 80 to
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter damage for me was the hardest one
to rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our scale goes from one, which is
damage to the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no survival, that's the one
you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: To five, which is no damage or just the
borders of the leaves looking like crispy
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm seeing a lot of plants like this
where there is damage to the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to the leaves, which puts these
plants between a two and a three on our
[SPEAKER_00]: rubric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a two would be major stem damage in the
range of 75% of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A three would be minor stem damage,
more like 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like these individual plants,
I would give a two, but there is a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plot of other plants that have different
levels of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the challenge of making a
rating on a plot basis rather than a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just do your best to choose a
rating that is reflective of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same plot, there are stems like
this, which are barely damaged,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit of leaf damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be more like a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of average that out
and say this plot gets a three for winter
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, because we have some that's fairly
damaged at all, some that is really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for spring vigor, we're looking at not
necessarily the absolute plant size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how fast, how vigorously is it putting
on new growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an awesome example of high
spring vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting on a lot of new, tender growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the plant's really awake and
alive and photosynthesizing and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out lots of new leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're rating a plot, not just a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other part of this plot is not
looking quite as hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give this a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's strong growth as kind of an
average of the really awesome looking part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plot and the less awesome looking
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part I'm going to give a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's acceptable growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly putting on new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see at the end of this pretty
damaged stem, it's putting on this really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice new leaf tissue, but it really hasn't
gotten cranking to the degree that that
[SPEAKER_00]: other plot had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now for arguably the most fun trait,
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to try the new
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like this that you can tell
is new and tender and it's easy to pinch
[SPEAKER_00]: off just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to say something like this,
like this is not going to be good eats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be more woody and not very
tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make you watch me chew
things, but I found some of these really
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice mix of sweetness and that rich pea
flavor that I think is really yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please sample if you like, only if you
like and rate flavor and texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I want to eat this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would seek it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is yuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you rate flavor, you may have rated
that in the fall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you choose flavor from the pull
down menu, your original ratings will come
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click the little arrow next to
your star rating and you'll get a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to enter a new rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if especially if your ratings changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can enter your new rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, you can enter a comment
like in the spring, this was very sweet or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be able to distinguish using
the time of the data entry what you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about fall flavor versus spring
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Thank you.
