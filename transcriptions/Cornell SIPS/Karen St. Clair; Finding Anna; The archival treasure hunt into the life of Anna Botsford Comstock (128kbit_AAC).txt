[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, everyone, welcome to my
presentation on Anna Bodsford Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Don mentioned, I was first introduced
to Anna through the nature study work that
[SPEAKER_00]: I did while working on my MPS at Smith
Woods with Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I discovered Anna, there was no
turning back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to find out more about her and
learn more about her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to continue on with my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in researching her, it just sort of
led me to my thesis, dissertation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I'm here to share with
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a scientist, and I know I'm
speaking to many scientists, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: points that I wanted to make clear before
I began talking about Anna is that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: and I understand that the foundations of
science are based on fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I am wanting to convey here to
all of you is that history, as it emerges
[SPEAKER_00]: from the authority of fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Bodsford Comstock, in my abstract,
Anna, oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna, this presentation is going to be
photographic rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are going to be repeats of
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: My abstract for my work with Anna Bodsford
Comstock has been that she contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly to fostering the imagination
in nature study education in the 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wanted to do in researching the
manuscript of the Comstocks of Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this book right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to do in researching the
manuscript of the Comstock of Cornell is I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to research this book for
historical accuracy and completeness,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to profess Comstock's
genuine voice, not only for her written
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy, but also for both scientific and
history within Cornell University itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here is a photograph from the
archives of both the Comstock's
[SPEAKER_00]: workspaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, who were the Comstocks of Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some of you who do not know
the Comstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're just familiar with the
name, but you're not too sure what is
[SPEAKER_00]: their legacy here at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Comstocks were both professors and
educators here at Cornell in the late 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: and early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock Hall is named for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a portrait of the Comstocks in
Comstock Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a display that's also within
Comstock Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first home was actually built right
here on the property where Baker's
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry building, the chemistry lab,
building is down campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this first home was torn down and then
made way for the buildings on campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereupon they built this new,
their new home, and what became known as
[SPEAKER_00]: the ledge, and then the chalet,
which became their publishing house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another place that the Comstock's name is
familiar is the Comstock Knoll that is now
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Cornell Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of the Comstock
Knoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a rhododendron collection up
there on the Knoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is interesting, they originally,
a little bit of the history of the Knoll
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they originally bought that piece
of property to build another house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where the herb garden is, down at the
Cornell Botanic Gardens, Mrs. Comstock
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to keep some cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when she wanted to publish her book,
handbook of nature study, they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have the money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sold this property to the
university so that they could fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: publishing of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna's and Professor Comstock's are also
seen in other parts of the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their desks are in the third floor of Mann
Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Anna's roll-top desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the professor's smaller
desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an image of him from the archives
sitting at his desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's that same image of their
workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here also in Mann is a portrait of Anna
Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three images here just to show
how this image was, this painting was made
[SPEAKER_00]: from this photographic image of Anna that
she posed for at about her 65th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's just a black and white
photo that she sent out, gifted to
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the painting itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is Anna's bachelor's degree from
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: She received a degree in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is an etching of the clock tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of the nature study
summer school of 1899 that Anna and her
[SPEAKER_00]: husband were a part of at that time with
the nature study education.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this image, it might be a little bit
difficult for you to see, but in this
[SPEAKER_00]: image we have a young Liberty Hyde Bailey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have John Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is John Walton, or excuse me,
John Walton Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Anna Comstock is up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many notable educators from the
nature study movement at Cornell in this
[SPEAKER_00]: photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this image, I just wanted to point
out this is a bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Goldman Smith bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this bench was put onto Cornell campus
about two years before Anna was a student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she used to sit on this bench all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I have sat on this bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bench is inscribed with above all
nations is humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of her favorite places to go
and to sit in between classes and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also found in the archives and as part of
the legacy of the Comstocks here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell is this photograph taken at
approximately 1922.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question mark isn't just me being
vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm copying it from this up here where
it's noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photograph of the Juguete Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today the Juguete is the entomological
club here on Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this photo we have Mrs. Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this guy here who's named
Mann.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of a library name for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have Glenn Herrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this here is Professor Needham.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all famous entomologists at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a little bit more of
Professor Comstock's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mrs. Comstock had a very strong hand
in with the entomological society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Comstock is also seen in Ithaca at
the Unitarian Church downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was her church.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here is of when she first
joined the church back June 11th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1911.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her husband did not join with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she would give sermons here at the
church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at her death, her adopted son and his
wife, George and Ada Russell, they donated
[SPEAKER_00]: this window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go downtown and take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their names are not on the window
because they wanted the focus not to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: them and the gift, but to be on her and
the work that she did in nature study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful window.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Comstock and her writing legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Comstock was steeped with the nature
study movement on several fronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nature study movement began here at
Cornell, actually, and I'll be discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: this a little bit further on, in the late
19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Anna, she wrote many modules that were
printed in publication for, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: pardon me, for Boys and Girls magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something that she worked on with
John Spencer and Martha Van Rensselaer
[SPEAKER_00]: when she first came to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had, they worked with Liberty
Hyde Bailey in the nature, and together,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a compilation of the nature study
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a compilation of the nature
study work that was done here at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be talking more about these later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, Anna also has her
handbook of nature study that I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was her Magnus Oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opus Magnum, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a real tour de force in the
nature study movement then, as it still is
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The significance of this is, well,
what Anna wanted, and for us today,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that Anna wanted the children with
their families to be involved with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted them to observe nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted them to be a part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted them to participate in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these images here, these are all of my
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a very nature-rich family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Devil's Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my grandson with the cheese
chipmunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminded me of this image down here
that Anna had, that she had drawn in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of her modules, Furry the Squirrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my parents picking apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, you can see me with the plants and my
husband with the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, please remember this image here,
this memorial image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that my daughter had
done on her university.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that, this is what Anna
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted us, all of us, and our children
to be involved with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Cornell today, we see this on our
campus through permaculture, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: art of horticulture, through Nina and
Peter, through the art class on Urban
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden, through the work in the Cornell
Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is Smith Woods and for me,
for my masters, exploring Smith Woods,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forested systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's me with Titus Arum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also with extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extension work is actually in Utah at
Thanksgiving Point Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this is also up at Cornell,
up in the gardens where Bill works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here from public garden management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classroom, this is when my, the class,
when I took the class that we went toward
[SPEAKER_00]: Chanticleer and Longwood Gardens among
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this history of nature study is
still very rich and prominent here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, but it's taken the guise of other
facets that are a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: than when Anna first came here on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who was Anna's Comstock?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about her
youth, her language, her artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Comstock, the base of her beliefs and
of her fundamental being was her Quaker
[SPEAKER_00]: upbringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the Quaker belief was that
they promoted equal rights of women,
[SPEAKER_00]: peace, promotion of education,
abolition of slavery, and the humane
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of incarcerated persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna and everyone that she spoke with or
interacted with, everyone that Anna wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: about, was that she embodied this
truthfulness, simplicity, and nonviolence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of God is in every person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was, Anna was considered a,
when at her death, she was described as a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her life was a poem.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was described as even keeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: She never got ruffled.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was never angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She always spoke politely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some images of Anna from her
youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were from the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the farm that she grew up on
in Otto, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are her Quaker parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a school, this is where her
college prep school, Chamberlain
[SPEAKER_00]: University, her mother's scrapbook,
another image of her mother, and an image
[SPEAKER_00]: of a younger Anna Comstock, approximately
the time when she came to Cornell as a
[SPEAKER_00]: student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna's language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna was very well read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a couple books here if you're
interested later to take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have books that was of interest to Anna,
and I have books that she wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The books that she read, she mentally hung
onto for her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her language was absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These words right here are taken from
Confessions to a Heathen Idol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this book, it was a book based on
her diaries, and in this book,
[SPEAKER_00]: she talked about such different themes as
being worn down by responsibilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to work a room at a party,
how professors can write books,
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness, and the definition of a kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: She carried with her Wordsworth's Prelude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this particular book, but this is a
copy of the book that she carried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Comstock used to carry with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a six volume set of The Count of
Monte Cristo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in French, and he used to take one or
two issues of those books with him when he
[SPEAKER_00]: would travel on the train, and Anna would
carry this book with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book talks about Wordsworth's life as
he grows from a child into a young man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of what he learns and what means the
most to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of nature references in
here, and this was the book that Anna
[SPEAKER_00]: carried with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of some of her
language, again, some images from the
[SPEAKER_00]: archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites is I Will Tell You a
Secret, which I discovered some time
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the heart's experiences are
auricular and some ventricular,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is only once in a lifetime that the
whole heart is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna is known, maybe more known for her
wood carving, which I'll get into in just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her first love and her initial work was
actually in watercolor and acrylic
[SPEAKER_00]: painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she first was married to John
Comstock, she was already practicing
[SPEAKER_00]: painting the insects and the insect body,
the bodies and the anatomy, with
[SPEAKER_00]: watercolor and pen and ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was John who wanted her to learn wood
carving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here down in the archives are her wood
engraving tools that she used to create
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful images.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't just do insects, she also did
animals and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a found piece within the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened up a book there that is Her Ways
of the Six-Footed, and inside this book
[SPEAKER_00]: was gifted to a young man, and she had put
in one of her etchings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was quite surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: To open up the book and find such a rare
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture here is called Moonlight
Sonata, and Anna carved this for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicago World's Fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some more images of Anna's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used to make these images,
like here up in the corner, these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners, these were gifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one down here was gifted to Martha
Van Rensselaer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one up here for Glenn Herrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some other images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a little bit about John Comstock,
because we are going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstocks of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know John Comstock is not
horticulturally based, but just bear with
[SPEAKER_00]: me a moment because I want to include
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Comstock was the founder of the
Department of Entomology here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some images of John through his
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here, which we will see again,
is I believe the last photo of him taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had suffered his first stroke in 1926,
and this was shortly thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Entomology Department, the
Comstock's original collection is there
[SPEAKER_00]: within their stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock, he and Anna worked together to
collect thousands of insects, and here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture from the Entomological Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They collected thousands of insects,
and made slides together, and this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: they formed the basis of the department
that it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today the department has over 70 million
specimens, and it is known not only as one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the top entomological departments in
the United States, but is also known
[SPEAKER_00]: globally for its work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some photos again of Professor
Comstock's office there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: entomological building, and here's the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insectary was built was unusual when
it was built at its day in 1888,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is where Comstock kind of ran his
buggy experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a photo inside the insectary
of Professor Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together the Comstocks worked on the
manual of the study of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They considered it their book together,
and within the archives I found the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: manuscript is there of this book in the
archives, and they were particularly proud
[SPEAKER_00]: of this image right here, because it was
one of the first colored images that they
[SPEAKER_00]: could have within the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in my book, I have a copy of the book
here if you would like to take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and in my book copy it is signed by
both Professor and Mrs. Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor and Mrs. Comstock, the two of
them met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a photograph from the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two of them met when she was a
student, and he was a professor here at
[SPEAKER_00]: entomology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is their marriage certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is something that she made for him at
Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made with deer hide, and she did
some drawing on the leather, and then she
[SPEAKER_00]: put their photos inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a little leatherette case that I
found that had both of their pictures in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is on the back, and her name is
not, and I think that it may be hers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of my friends down in the archives
said, well, how do you know it's hers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I know I've got pictures of my
family and kids in my wallet, and I put
[SPEAKER_00]: their names on the back, but if I'm in the
picture, I don't put my name on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who I am, so that's why I don't
think that this was hers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is an image of the Comstocks
later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the painting that hangs now in
Comstock Hall, and again, these are some
[SPEAKER_00]: more images of the Comstocks through their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are traveling in Italy and in
Egypt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is Anna Comstock at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see by this image, this will talk
about some of the quality of the artifacts
[SPEAKER_00]: in the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just we'll keep a little mental note
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this was something that they put
together for their friends and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would put together a little booklet
called Greetings and Best Wishes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would give this as a Christmas
present, and this was Anna's copy because
[SPEAKER_00]: she labeled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this book is, is it's like a walk
through their grounds of their house,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really a wonderful document,
just a photographic document of their
[SPEAKER_00]: home, their grounds, and just a little
peek into their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sundial is still standing there in
their house where they used to live,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was a favorite of Anna's,
and she often painted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the house on the Hermitage in
Kugle Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invited by the family of Professor
Rice to come and visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now owned by the Rice family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Trumanburg, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where Anna wrote Handbook of
Nature Study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my husband and I, we were invited
to come to the family home and to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come here for picnics, and there's
like 42 of them that discuss the ins and
[SPEAKER_00]: outs of what happens here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to find, I looked up on,
oh, pardon me, I looked up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bookshelf, and I found a copy of
Confessions to a Heathen Idol that was
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated to Mrs. Rice from Anna Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yep, so this is the view from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the top looking down towards
Kugle Lake, and this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedrooms, and there was a very large orb
spider that had made its home,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought, oh, how apropos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a look of the view of the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have the microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was added later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Comstocks, as they are getting older,
in their retirement, they traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a rare photo that I found in a
different finding in the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the last trip that they took before
Professor Comstock suffered his first
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke, and Anna alludes to it in this
photo here and on the back where she said
[SPEAKER_00]: the last snapshot before he was taken
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this photo, this is after he,
was taken ill, and you can see he's
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning on the banister, and they have put
a blanket here for him to lean on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just more for interest as I
talk about the Comstocks and their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, there's no more photos at this
point of Professor Comstock because he was
[SPEAKER_00]: bedridden and an invalid by the time,
in 1928, shortly before he died in 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 1928, he could not speak,
and he could not speak, and he was an
[SPEAKER_00]: invalid in his bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here comes Craig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image, one of the things with
archival research as well is not only am I
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating somebody who's interesting
in the nature study movement, but I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating their lives, and I'm
learning about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show a little bit of
forensic detection because sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a look at these images of
Anna's ankles and feet, she was very,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very swollen, and in her,
she had a heart, she was actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: frail for most of her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had gotten, I believe it was typhoid,
and it is something that affected her
[SPEAKER_00]: heart for the rest, when she got the
typhoid as a young woman in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it affected her health for the rest of
her life, and especially her heart health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had this swelling of her feet and
ankles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these last images, she also had lung
cancer, but she did not know she had lung
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That information was kept from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was only, her doctor was told about
it and a close friend who was taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Comstocks at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this here is the last image of
Anna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to me to see in these
how thin she is, and this is when she's 75
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a year before she died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet how thin and frail she is,
yet how swollen her feet and ankles are.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, and she, again, here's a birthday
photo by her favorite sundial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit, I've mentioned archival
investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to touch upon this a little bit
because this is where their legacy has
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is in the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here, when I would, when I go into
the archives, I don't always know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in these packages,
I found the entire manuscript for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Handbook of Insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found the set up pages for the book
in these packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The archives are located down campus at
Olin and Kroc Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's where you can find me most days
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not out in a garden somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some current display that they
have going on right now is a punk history.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to the archives, what I'm doing
is I'm first, I generate my, a slip on the
[SPEAKER_00]: finding aid of what I would like to take a
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then go back into the vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pull out what I need, and then that's
where we start looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular example, we have the
registrar book for the Comstocks when they
[SPEAKER_00]: took their class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, here's, so this is kind
of in progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book, we're looking at the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the page, we found the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is Anna's name on page 307,
or excuse me, listing 307.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is Anna's, this is her registrar
of classes that she took.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, and over here is the registrar
of classes that John took.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, often when you're doing archival
research, it is going down a rabbit hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to be careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some interesting things to discover in the
archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something to discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found these copper plates from their
butterfly, from Comstock's butterfly book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Professor Burr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we've got, signatures are always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual, again, more photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorites over here is Ezra
Cornell's wedding socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went to outer space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mother made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to take them to outer space,
and he wanted to take, the astronaut
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to take a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The archives said nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gave him Ezra Cornell's socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we, now, in talking about with the,
through the archives, I became acquainted
[SPEAKER_00]: with Stacey, and she, after reading her
book, Vera, and then I also read clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: Opatra, and I've got her other book,
Witches, for my summer read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stacey told me, when I was talking
about what I was finding, that was an
[SPEAKER_00]: error in the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I'm kind of jumping around a
little bit, because I've been doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: for five years, so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we were talking about is how
history is preserved and how history is
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Stacey said is how we constitute
and reconstitute history is through our
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considered an iconic photo of
Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1905 on a picnic
[SPEAKER_00]: with some students.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photo may look familiar to many of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is the real photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this photo, Liberty Hyde Bailey,
we'll show you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberty Hyde Bailey looks like he's having
a sandwich here with students.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's actually doing is he's talking
with Anna Botsford Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, I said that Anna and Bailey
worked together and collaborated on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflets in the Cornell Nature Study
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite interesting that here,
that someone so prominent in the
[SPEAKER_00]: department is actually is cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the original source was not,
if we did not have it, we would not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cut and paste is a little bit
later on is of the Comstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original photo here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look here, there are two empty
chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Comstocks are sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early Photoshopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early Photoshopping, isn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, the first photo I found was
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at it, and I thought,
what the heck is wrong with her?
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks so odd to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was after that I found farther
in the file this photo here with the empty
[SPEAKER_00]: chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Comstocks at this time,
this was after Professor Comstock had his
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke, and they were both pretty frail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did for the entomology
department is they took the picture with
[SPEAKER_00]: the two chairs told as spacers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for him, I believe they took his image
from this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was taken by John P. Troy in 1926
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hers, I haven't found which photo
it is from her yet, but it had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: been probably around the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to the Comstocks of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the book that started it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my copy of the Comstocks of
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well-loved, and there's a lot of
stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Comstocks of Cornell, she began
writing this memoir about 1914 when John
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock was retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first opened this book,
The Comstocks of Cornell, what I found was
[SPEAKER_00]: this photo of John Henry, and I thought,
where the heck is Anna?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's on page 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started writing this book in 1914.
[SPEAKER_00]: She finished it a few months before her
death in 1930.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, if this is their
book, why the heck is she so far in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where it began my dissertation
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a photograph of the
manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here is a copy of the manuscript in
these folders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 19 folders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my work at the archives with the
manuscript and side by side with the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be a little bit difficult to
see, but I have penciled into the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're welcome to look later if you
want at my notations of where things were
[SPEAKER_00]: omitted out of the book from the
manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is really sobering about this
manuscript, and I guess this is what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, what I was referring to in
the very beginning when I said that
[SPEAKER_00]: history emerges from the authority of
fact, the point that I would like to make
[SPEAKER_00]: is that documents such as this manuscript,
when they are censored, then the facts and
[SPEAKER_00]: by association, the history is skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book, keeping in mind that this is
part of a foundation of natural study
[SPEAKER_00]: science, the history of natural study
science has been skewed because of these
[SPEAKER_00]: omissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see that these
omissions are one-sided.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this here is a page written
about Anna Comstock's life versus a page
[SPEAKER_00]: about John Comstock's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some other pages from the
manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with a china marker,
with a black or purple china marker,
[SPEAKER_00]: and out is written across the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I showed in the other slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show a close-up, this is a
close-up of the edits on the page of
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show quickly, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now Professor Comstock's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, the difference between
the two of how she was heavily censored
[SPEAKER_00]: out and speaking of out, what I also found
is that there were huge sections of the
[SPEAKER_00]: manuscript that were crossed off like this
and with the word out written across the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also another flag in my mind,
what is going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what I started to do is I started
to research who were the handlers of this
[SPEAKER_00]: manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that there were at least six
people who handled the manuscript from the
[SPEAKER_00]: time that the Comstocks died to the time
that it was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: These included Ruby Greensmith,
who was a Cornell professor here in home
[SPEAKER_00]: economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, she received her PhD with
Professor Comstock in entomology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Glenn Herrick, also a professor
of entomology here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also, he was the Comstock's cousin,
and he was bequeathed their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: objects upon their death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a minor, lesser-known
person, Francis Wormuth, who was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a Cornell alum, but who went on to
practice constitutional law and as a law
[SPEAKER_00]: professor at the University of Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three, the first two are
considered the editors of the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he is just mentioned in the
introduction as a by-the-way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I later found in who handled the
Comstock Cornell were these three,
[SPEAKER_00]: two particular close friends of the
Comstocks, the Gage, Simon Henry Gage,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was also a professor in entomology,
and he was a close personal friend to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstocks, both he and his first wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lived next to each other,
and their children, they were known as,
[SPEAKER_00]: called Anna, and her husband, Aunt Anna,
and Uncle John.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was George Burr.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Burr was a Cornell professor of
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also the personal secretary to
Andrew D.
[SPEAKER_00]: White.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is responsible for a great amount of
the A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitech Library collection down in
Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not been there, go take a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very protective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both very protective of the
Comstocks, I would say particularly Burr,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burr lived with the Comstocks for a great
part of his life on and off, and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when his wife and child died in
childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back to live with the Comstocks,
and they took him in.
[SPEAKER_00]: New to the list, and which was unknown at
first to me, was Woodford Patterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was secretary to Cornell University
from 1917 to 1940.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew of the Comstocks, and he was also
the university publisher for about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there were early publications,
other than the Comstocks of Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: that talked about the life of Anna and
John, and I want to mention them briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an article that Anna wrote for
the Cornell Daily Sun called Pioneers
[SPEAKER_00]: Among Women.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually chapter five in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also an article written by Ruby
Greensmith years after the Comstocks died
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1930 and 31 called the Cornell's
Educational Pioneers, the Comstocks of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time we see the term
Comstocks of Cornell in print,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a year later, James Needham,
also an entomologist, he wrote The
[SPEAKER_00]: Lengthened Shadow of a Man and His Wife,
and that is predominantly about John
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock's contribution to the entomology
lab, but it also, because of Anna's close
[SPEAKER_00]: association with his work, she's also
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is a timeline that I want,
that I'm going to be showing again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I want, there are a couple things
I want to piece off here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Comstocks died in 1930.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Comstock died in 1930.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months later, her husband died,
and after he died, the university became
[SPEAKER_00]: owners of the Comstock Publishing Company,
so that is one piece of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: After, not only the university became
owner of the Comstock Publishing Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also Glenn Herrick became owners of
their personal property, and it was from
[SPEAKER_00]: this time up until about 1936,
1937, Glenn Herrick, who I remember I said
[SPEAKER_00]: was a cousin to Comstock, he had that
manuscript, and he was hell-bent six ways
[SPEAKER_00]: on wanting to get it published.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1937 and in 1938, there was a lot of
letters and correspondence going back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth between Burr and Gage and Herrick
and Gage for about the printing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biography of the Comstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Gage finally put the letter to,
he said, he said let us send this to
[SPEAKER_00]: Patterson, Woodford Patterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woodford Patterson wrote him back in July
of that year, and this letter was a huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a huge turning point for the fate
of the manuscript, and I'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the letters, what I wanted to be clear
about these letters and why I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about why there was such a back and
forth with the letters is that right from
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning, Herrick was very clear in
that he felt that the manuscript was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make an interesting book that it would
have a wide audience outside of their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and that it would have wide and
remunerative sale, that since that both is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the work of both Comstocks,
that he felt that the title should be Our
[SPEAKER_00]: Years Together as Teachers, Scientists and
Writers, and Autobiography of John Henry
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock and Anna Comstock, and this is an
important point that I wanted to make on
[SPEAKER_00]: this because later on, after the Woodford
Patterson letter, when the turn of events
[SPEAKER_00]: changed for the manuscript, this is where
Gage, Burr, or Herrick tried to solicit
[SPEAKER_00]: advice from Gage or Burr about the
manuscript, and so there was a proposal to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the manuscript, and Herrick
proposed this to Herrick, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrick proposed this to Burr,
and Burr's response back to him was that
[SPEAKER_00]: he was so adverse to the changing of the
manuscript, especially since the,
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody no longer was around to be
consulted, he said that he could not bring
[SPEAKER_00]: himself to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Woodford Patterson letter that was the
turn of the change of events that came
[SPEAKER_00]: back and it said with the manuscript that
he felt that the publication of the
[SPEAKER_00]: manuscript would be a blunder,
that it was a desultory recital loosely
[SPEAKER_00]: related on the occupations and diversions
of Mrs. Comstock's travels and occupations
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that the style of the book was
repulsive and that it was diffuse and
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said that it was a trickle of
miscellaneous reminences which goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: without any order except that of a
chronological succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon Gage was convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point when he received this letter
back from Patterson, he set about to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince Herrick to not publish the
manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, and a couple of notes that I
found in his papers, he said that he wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: these notes for himself in talking with
Herrick, he said that he felt that
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Comstock was the real original
character altogether subordinated by Mrs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock who was a forceful character but
only with secondhand material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words he's saying that her
nature study work was the secondhand
[SPEAKER_00]: material whereas Professor Comstock was
the first hand and was the creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said that perhaps a biography
could be created of the Comstocks and with
[SPEAKER_00]: a large emphasis on, put on Professor
Comstock and the work of Mrs. Comstock but
[SPEAKER_00]: not on the dinner parties and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I know is that this manuscript was
heavily edited and out the chapters of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Comstock's life but that the events
of John's life were intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only self-deprecating statements about
him or talking about him in depression or
[SPEAKER_00]: blue moods, that was all removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I infer is that Herrick presented his
version of the book Comstocks of Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Cornell community both in the
entomological and nature study fields in
[SPEAKER_00]: general as a foundation text.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it served as a foundation text for
both the biography of both Professor and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not, Herrick did not attempt to
correct the edited manuscript to its
[SPEAKER_00]: original 1937 format when he had the
chance to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He removed pages from the manuscript as
well as a complete chapter and he
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially destroyed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then there have been scores of
articles and books since 1953 which have
[SPEAKER_00]: used this book Comstocks of Cornell which
they quote directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I was talking about when I
said that he used this as a foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: text and he did not attempt to correct the
1937 format.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that the Comstocks of Cornell
was published in 1953, and this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicate of the timeline of what was
going on, but by the time the book was
[SPEAKER_00]: published in 1953 all these key people
that had a hand in the book were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Herrick was free to do as he desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was omitted from the book are 320
pages of the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Woodford Patterson received the
manuscript he said he received 20 chapters
[SPEAKER_00]: and 760 pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now and from the book there are 320
pages missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also omitted from the book are
Cornell personalities, life tasks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opinion of Anna Comstock, religious
references, other educators that were
[SPEAKER_00]: active in the nature study movement at
Cornell and were pillars in the active
[SPEAKER_00]: nature study movement at Cornell at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chapter 14 of the manuscript is
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have found that Herrick had in his
own personal papers where papers were
[SPEAKER_00]: burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was burning papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was preserved are most of the
highlights of Comstocks professional life,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially John Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say dominant Cornell
personalities I mean like President White.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were some of the nature study
pioneers at Cornell University that are
[SPEAKER_00]: omitted from the Comstock of Cornell book
but are in the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Comstock gave credit where credit was
due.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the folks that are not,
like I said, that were not in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Rogers Miller, she was appointed the
nature study lecturer, appointed lecturer
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature study from 1897 to 1903.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only one reference of her in the
Comstocks of Cornell and that is in a
[SPEAKER_00]: footnote about her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote about her husband, asterisk
down below, oh by the way there was Mary
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogers Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Rogers Miller also wrote,
authored the book The Brook Book and its
[SPEAKER_00]: first acquaintance with the Brook.
[SPEAKER_00]: She dedicated this to John Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked with Comstock on her bachelor's
thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also omitted from the book is Mary Rogers
Miller's sister Julia Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julia Rogers was a valedictorian not only
of her high school class but a
[SPEAKER_00]: valedictorian of her pre-college work at
the Iowa State University before she came
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came here to Cornell, valedictorian of
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: She received her master's degree in
horticulture and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did her thesis work with Comstock and
she was from 1902 to 1912, she was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: editorial staff of the Country Life
Magazine in America and from 1902 to 1916
[SPEAKER_00]: she was the writer of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: These books right here for a double day.
[SPEAKER_00]: She moved to Long Beach, California in her
later life and was very active with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community there and she was on the board
of, for example, the fatherless children.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on the park board at Long Beach
Board of Education and the NRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She published two books, the Tree Book,
the Shell Book and she was in Who's Who of
[SPEAKER_00]: America in 1902.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Walton Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Walton Spencer, he was, I put this
letter that he received.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cherry farmer from Cataraugus
County with no formal education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a pioneer in the Junior Naturalist
Club that reached tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: children all over New York and across the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: He personally answered the letters to all
of the children who wrote in for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature Study, the Junior Naturalist Club,
but he stopped writing the letters to
[SPEAKER_00]: himself personally when his number reached
30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked for membership for these children
that they send a letter a month as to what
[SPEAKER_00]: their club was doing and gardening around
their communities or school and he also
[SPEAKER_00]: asked for their birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one time there were 80,000 birthdays
that were recorded within the offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alice McCluskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alice McCluskey is only referred in the
book, one reference to the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Anna Comstock's assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a, she was the Nature Study,
she was not only an assistant in Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: Study but she was also a lecturer in
Nature Study and Associate of Rural
[SPEAKER_00]: Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked hand-in-hand with Liberty Hyde
Bailey before Anna Comstock did and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this Cornell study leaflets of the 30
children's leaflets in this book she wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 of them and she is only, as I said,
she is only mentioned in this book once.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is wiped from a lot of history and
other, in current literature that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: found and to the point that I cannot find
a photograph of her as of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have a picture of her gravestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, Clara, I wanted to mention Clara
Trump because she worked with John Spencer
[SPEAKER_00]: because of his education that he could not
spell or punctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wrote his letters for him but she was
also, after his death, she became
[SPEAKER_00]: Comstock's secretary and Comstock had her
learn to imitate her handwriting and sign
[SPEAKER_00]: her letters and sign Comstock's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a book that is signed by
Anna Botsford Comstock, it might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: signed by Anna Botsford Comstock,
it could be signed by Clara Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, Clara herself said that she did
such a good job herself that she has two
[SPEAKER_00]: books, one is her signature, one is Anna's
and she can't tell herself which book was
[SPEAKER_00]: her, which.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the chapter that is missing
from the manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Herrick wrote in his shaky
handwriting that he could not account for
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 14 is in this book, however it is
not in the manuscript and it is this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular chapter that talks about the
history of the nature study movement here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that Herrick had synchrophatic
tendencies for publishing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning for his own gain, despite the
objections of Burr, Gage, and Patterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continued to press forth with the
publication of this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is suspect for burning the papers and
