[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I am the last speaker of the
session and I'll introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know me, I am Elena
Vatamanyuk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am faculty of the soils and crop
sciences section in plant biology section
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to talk today about is
about using synchrotron x-ray fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll refer to it as XRF, as an imaging and
high precision phenotyping tool for
[SPEAKER_00]: studies of mineral nutrient homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk today mainly about iron,
micronutrient iron and micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: copper because that's what we study in a
lab and also because of the relevance of
[SPEAKER_00]: these elements for the future of food
security and human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just briefly what I'll do today,
after a really short introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: providing the rationale for studies of
iron and copper homeostasis in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll briefly introduce the basics of
synchrotron x-ray fluorescent microscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the relevance of this technology for
studies of mineral nutrient homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the last part I'll show you
some examples from my lab which
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate how XRF was useful for us to
understand the function of the oligopetite
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter OPT3 in iron homeostasis and
the whole pathway, regulatory pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: SPL7-C1 regulatory pathway in copper
homeostasis and relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: copper and plant fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again the studies are done mainly in
aerobidopsis but I'll continue with some
[SPEAKER_00]: crop species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as many of you appreciate providing
enough food for the growing well
[SPEAKER_00]: population is one of the top challenges of
the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even today up to a billion people go
in a well, go to bed hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consume less than 2,000 calories per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are people mainly in the
developing countries that you can see from
[SPEAKER_00]: this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these countries people mainly
because of their resource poor,
[SPEAKER_00]: they mainly confined to plant-based foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these plant-based food,
the staple crops which are grown and used
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country is mainly rice,
corn and in some cases wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inherently lower the concentration of
nutrients and minerals such as iron and
[SPEAKER_00]: copper and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in addition to consuming fewer than
2,000 calories per day, people in these
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, they suffer from so-called
hidden hunger which was the term coined by
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross Welch here at Cornell at USDA to
reflect the nutrient deficiency associated
[SPEAKER_00]: health disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, many of you know and many of
you probably know that iron deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: anemia is one of the most prevailing
nutritional disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it affects more than 30% of the
world's population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it is responsible for up to
well a million deaths annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again if you look in this map,
these are people which are living in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again people in these countries are
confined mainly to plant-based foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the ways how to combat this
malnutrition is to bi-fortify crops with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and with minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is images as one of the
sustainable approaches how to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so copper deficiency in humans is
not as widespread as iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, copper deficiency in soils can
really dramatically decrease crop
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity while it significantly
affects plant fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wheat anecdotally suffers apparently
the most from copper deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those deficiency like iron deficiency
in the soil and copper deficiency in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and then it's actually zinc
deficiency occurs mainly in alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the map you can see it colored as
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this alkaline and also natural soils
they occupy more than 30% of the arable
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and so if we really wanna sort
of meet the challenge of providing more
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing food production by 70% in the
next 40 years and also if you wanna make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we are able to bi-fortify edible
parts of plants with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to know how crops deal with their
environment, the soil environment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitation of micronutrients in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it comes down to knowledge of the
transport systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know how transporters,
which transporters and which regulators of
[SPEAKER_00]: those transporters are responsible for
moving elements under deficiency condition
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil into the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: How these animals, how these elements are
distributed in the plant body loaded into
[SPEAKER_00]: the edible tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they reabsorb for example from leaves
and moved to sinks such as seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that regard X-ray fluorescent
microscopy, it's images like really
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful tool which allows us to identify
novel genes and characterize genes which
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved in mineral nutrient
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the reason why X-RF is so
useful and can be useful because normally
[SPEAKER_00]: in many cases disruption of genes encoding
transporters or regulators of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters will lead to changes in the
distribution of the spatial distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of elements in the plant, in a tissue or
actually and subcellularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one can use, just use X-RF to
compare wild type tissue versus the mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and see whether the changes of the
spatial distribution occur or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here this is almost a classical
example from Marilu Gorilno lab showing
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis wild type seed and iron
distribution in wild type seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a mutant for the vacuola or
iron transporter and it gets as a mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and you can see that the pattern of
iron distribution significantly changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course combining other functional
genomic approaches one can infer what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how X-RF help, what's X-RF first of
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So X-RF is imaging technique which allows
you to visualize the spatial distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of elements in a sample at the different
resolution scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really in a nutshell very
simplistically X-RF is based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: detection of secondary arrays or we call
it fluorescence which are emitted by atoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sample when the sample itself is
rusted through with X-Rays, really high
[SPEAKER_00]: energy X-Rays that are generated at a
synchrotron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really cool feature about this
technique is that each element emit has
[SPEAKER_00]: its very specific energy fingerprint and
what it allows you, it allows you to map
[SPEAKER_00]: the distribution of, you basically can
follow the distribution of particular
[SPEAKER_00]: element in a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is exemplified by the
distribution analysis of different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements as you can see calcium,
copper, zinc and iron in the leaf and this
[SPEAKER_00]: has been done simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the advantages of using X-RF
over other imaging technique, well first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all it's incredibly sensitive,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can visualize micronutrients such as
copper which is present in plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: really, I mean it basically is single
digits PPMs and in mutants even below PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can still do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the excellent feature to us of this
technique and to many is that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really need to prepare
samples, well depending on the resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just take what we do in a lab,
just take a leaf, go to the synchrotron
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at the elements which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very high spatial resolution and we
can analyze pretty much all elements of
[SPEAKER_00]: the periodic table and for us important
elements are copper, iron and we are also
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning more towards zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this technique helped us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were wondering, we were working on a
transporter called oligopeptide
[SPEAKER_00]: transporter which was initially identified
in the Gary Stacey lab and it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: known that OPT3, I'll refer to it as OPT3,
oligopeptide transporter is somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in iron homestead stasis but the
substrate of the transporter was unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: and the OPT3 itself, the mutant has very
intriguing properties of which I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to highlight one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves of the OPT3 mutant accumulated
significantly like huge amount of iron
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the wild type but yet the
seeds of the mutant contain significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: less iron than the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unusual because typically seeds get
their minerals from leaves and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be expecting that if leaf have so much
iron then seeds would have so much iron
[SPEAKER_00]: but yet it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to understand like what's going on
with iron in the leaves, we decided to use
[SPEAKER_00]: XRF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see what maybe iron is
distributed differently in the leaf of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant versus the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we collaborated with Mary Lugo-Renaud
and what we found, we found that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: iron is trapped in the vasculature of the
leaf of the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking here is the iron
distribution in the wild type and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly, it's evenly distributed but with
main localization in vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you look at the leaf of OPT3
mutant, you can see that iron is just
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighted in the minor ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's trapped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it already led us to the idea,
well, iron just cannot be remobilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's so high in leaves and
it's so low in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we moved on to see,
well, vasculature consists of xylem and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fluem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem, that's the vasculature tissue which
delivers minerals from the roots and into
[SPEAKER_00]: the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then fluem is the tissue which is
responsible for remobilizing minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering minerals from the sources such
as the leaf to sinks such as seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we analyzed the iron concentration in
xylem and the fluem sap and we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the xylem sap hyperaccumulates
iron while the fluem in the mutant has
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly less iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we are looking here is
iron in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so next question was, okay,
well, that's the mutant for OPT3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what OPT3 is doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next step was, well,
we have to know where the OPT3 localizes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the xylem, is it in the fluem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that can tell us what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moving iron from the xylem and then
the mutant hyperaccumulates it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem or it somehow moves iron from the
xylem into the fluem and so it cannot load
[SPEAKER_00]: the iron into the fluem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just simplify the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically we found that OPT3 is localized
to the fluem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fluem transporter and mutation of
which leads to the decreased concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of iron in the fluem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final sort of cherry of the
cake was actually finding that OPT3 is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually an iron transporter and we
collaborated with Miguel Pinaros from USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: here and we showed together that OPT3,
well, what you're looking here is oocytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: xenopus oocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some uptake studies in xenopus
oocytes and so OPT3 is actually localized
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plasma membrane and it can,
in xenopus oocytes and in Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: protoplus, and it can move iron into the
oocyte cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing here over time,
OPT3 is black bar and you can see that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has OPT3 expressing oocyte cell contain
more iron than control non-expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this helped us to understand,
so basically XRF was sort of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: step forward to understand what happening
to the OPT3 mutant and why the mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: why it hyperaccumulates so much iron in
the leaf, it cannot move it into the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically it's because the iron is
trapped in the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you have to combine XRF's
other techniques, what we've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: to fully characterize the gene function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we sort of hope for,
we hope that OPT3 and its homologs from
[SPEAKER_00]: crop species can be used for
biofortification because OPT3 is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for loading of iron into the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I sort of switch gears to copper
and again, just to reiterate the point
[SPEAKER_00]: that while copper is not as, copper
deficiency is not as widespread for
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, for the plants it can be
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, while I teach mineral
nutrition and I teach in a class that
[SPEAKER_00]: while copper is needed for fertility and
we know that's in a field, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in a wheat, wheat grown
under really low copper is infertile and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we never knew why copper is
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But however copper is toxic, together as
iron is toxic when it accumulates in
[SPEAKER_00]: excess, so plants have to really slightly
regulate copper homeostasis to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has enough to prevent deficiency
but also avoid toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this regulation in the plants is
achieved by the transcription factor which
[SPEAKER_00]: belongs to the family of SPL or SBP
binding domain transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: SPL7.
[SPEAKER_00]: SPL7 what it does, like really simple
model of the SPL7 based regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: copper homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under copper deficiency, SPL7 upregulates
expression of copper uptake and the
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters and also genes encoding
transporters which are responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal copper movement in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second role is that SPL7
upregulates the so called copper
[SPEAKER_00]: reutilization system or we call it copper
economy system when plants try to feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own reserves and just metabolize,
just get rid of very abundant but
[SPEAKER_00]: unessential copper protein and so deliver
copper to much more essential copper
[SPEAKER_00]: requiring functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is not surprise that SPL7 mutant
of course it's sensitive to low copper in
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point here that SPL7 was the only
transcription factor which was known to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate copper homeostasis in vascular
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were very excited when a PhD
student in a lab, Jope Young, she
[SPEAKER_00]: identified a novel copper responsive
transcription factor which we designated
[SPEAKER_00]: set one, copper deficiency induced
transcription factor one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the bread and butter work,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to see whether it's upregulated,
it's copper regulated but whether it has
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do with regulating copper
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have to go down to the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jope isolated the mutant and she
grew the mutant in the presence of low
[SPEAKER_00]: copper and what she found that under
control condition, the mutant was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much as a wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see this is the mutant
expressing the set one genomic fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a complimentary line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then under copper deficiency,
the mutant was growing really poorly and
[SPEAKER_00]: also developed this chlorotic spots on
mature leaves which are indicative of
[SPEAKER_00]: copper deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the genomic fragment can fully
complement the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that this, you know,
copper's increased sensitivity to copper
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency as associated with the
decreased ability of the mutant to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and move iron in a plant body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here you can see that in a
root, the set one mutant has significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: less copper than the wild type and it's
pretty much true for each tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we analyzed flowers because
remember I mentioned that copper was
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with, somehow it was always
mentioned that copper is needed for
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we also analyzed copper
accumulation in flowers of the mutant and
[SPEAKER_00]: had less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what is noticeable here that
actually there was some, there was less
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in a sleek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next we decided to see,
well, is there a relationship between this
[SPEAKER_00]: newly identified transcription factors set
one and the previously known transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors PL7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our rationale was that,
well, if these two transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: they work in the same pathway,
then in a double mutant, which would see
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a PL7 like phenotype,
which are the smaller growth under,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, under limited copper condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that actually not what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, well, we actually, it was
difficult for us to find the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really literally took us a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, we had to have a
modifying loop and we found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but the problem was that the mutant
eventually died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phenotype was seedling and seedling
lethality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, it took us so much time to
understand that actually that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which meant that the pathway is much
more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was we previously thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we were able to rescue this
seeding lethality of the mutant with high
[SPEAKER_00]: copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what you see here, different
plant lines, wild types at one SPL7,
[SPEAKER_00]: single mutants and the double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mutant, the double mutant now
grows, well, grows up to the reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's smaller, but it actually has
the same amount of copper as wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was already for us interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's smaller, but has the same
amount of copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what we noticed that although the
mutant, the seedling lethality is rescued
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mutant grows, the double mutant
grows to the reproductive stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the double mutant is fully infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's 90% infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here again, and this is at
50 micromolar copper, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high non-toxic, we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you can see other genotypes
are doing quite well, but the double
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant, it's infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just elongated carpals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really to cut real long story short,
we were able to detect that that's due to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen defects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the double mutant produces like 90%
less pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of the pollen produced,
more than 20% of the pollen produced is
[SPEAKER_00]: unviable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very strong pollen fertility
defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this double mutant has the same
amount of copper as other lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was for us very puzzling,
like what's happening there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we were thinking,
well, maybe there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hypotheses may be these two
transcription factors, they correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: copper delivery to the specific flower
structures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our favorite hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we could not exclude the
possibility that these are transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, they can relate so many other
things in a plant, and maybe it has
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do with copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we favored the first
hypothesis, and so how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we turned again to XRF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we have to really look where
copper localizes within the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to emphasize that it was not
known before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we knew before, it was just copper is
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where copper is, is it petals,
is it sepals, is it anthers, is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, no one knew before it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that time, we already took
advantage from the fact that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: synchrotron facility here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Cornell High Energy Synchrotron
Source here, Wilson Lab, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Bradfield Hall, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very convenient, it just depending how you
go, different routes, but regardless,
[SPEAKER_00]: five minutes at most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the postdoc in the lab, they
collaborated with Rong, Huang,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Arthur Waller-Chess, and together what
we were able to find is that actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of copper, if you look at the
flower, and this is the wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you see here is the distribution,
the copper density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of copper is really peaks at
anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also localizes at carcals, but the
majority is still in anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at the different
mutant lines, we can see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, set one is, well, it's somewhat
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: SpL7 is more affected, but then the double
mutant has barely detectable copper,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also looked for other elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked for iron, and I mean,
it's a long story why we looked for iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was very important to us to show
that it's not just, so it's actually just
[SPEAKER_00]: copper, it's not iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you see here, that iron is
almost no, I mean, it's not statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what it allows us to show
that copper, well, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: copper is localized in anthers and also in
carcals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can pinpoint that this pollen
infertility defect of the double mutant is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually associated with the inability of
the mutant to move copper into the
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and just to conclude,
this part, so basically it was known for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while that well, flower development and
flower fertility is controlled by many
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, which include photoperiod and
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using XRF, we were first of all able to
identify which floral organs contain
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals, and also XRF allowed us to put
transition metals, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: copper, as very significant contributing
factor to plant fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we are very interested now to
translate this knowledge we gain in model
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis to crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are collaborating with Mark
Sorrells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using mapping population,
wheat mapping population generated in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark's lab with the hope to identify QTLs,
which will sort of be associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: copper delivery to anthers fertility and
improved yield of wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already started doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here, you're seeing
florets of two parental line, and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: they are offsprings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing that two parental
line, they have different, they differ in
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of copper in anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I don't know, incidentally,
these two parental lines also differ in
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Mark can correct me if I'm wrong,
but they, and so it seems that the W7984
[SPEAKER_00]: is low yielding variety, and it yet
accumulate less copper in anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what we are seeing that there is
a segregation for copper accumulation in
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers and actually in all reproductive
organs, because this is carpals in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really hope that this will lead us
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also collaborating with Susan
McCooch, and we are trying to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt this technology also to rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, we call it semi-high
throughput, so these are 14 lines in six
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about high throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are seeds, seeds of rice,
and what it allows us to see, the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of elements in seed tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the importance of this is such that I
mentioned before that rice is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the majority of cereal crop,
they have very low concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals in grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rice is the worst, and especially
white rice is the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is that the majority of
minerals, especially such as iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: they accumulate in a hull in aileron
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the breeding should be,
and all of them, the goal would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually to identify varieties that will
have iron not, and maybe zinc and other
[SPEAKER_00]: elements, not the aileron layer and in the
hull, but actually moving iron into the
[SPEAKER_00]: endosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is like the first step or just
as 14 after I think 2,000 lines that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been generated in Susan's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to conclude overall this talk,
I hope I can sort of convince you that XRF
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really powerful tool, one of the
tools that can help us to infer the
[SPEAKER_00]: function of genes in mineral nutrient
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope, and we all hope for you
this tool, that it will help us to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for better crops, for safer and more
nutrient-dense crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to acknowledge
my lab members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ji Pei, she was working on SPL-7-71
project, Ju Chen-Chi, and Hui-Cin Zhen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are two people in the lab who are
really pushing forward this XRF studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank our
collaborators, Arthur Ward and Rong Huan
[SPEAKER_00]: from CHESS, Miguel from Roberts-Holley
Center, here at Cornell, Mark Sorrell,
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan Makuch, Mary Lou Gorinot,
and Leon Kochen, and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have one question, or we can take
it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for the attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
