[SPEAKER_09]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_09]: This talk is kind of an overview of what I
thought about planets and it's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: specific research that has been finished
or I've written some conclusions to the
[SPEAKER_06]: research.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly my experiment going out with
what I think about planets and trying some
[SPEAKER_06]: way to communicate with the broader plant
biology community and find some help or
[SPEAKER_06]: some collaborative future interaction for
the research I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this particular presentation,
I have to start from the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get too excited, I may sleep for
another 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why from the end?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is not my effort really.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an effort of many people that are
spread all over six continents and
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking 20 or more languages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are really the ones that made
this possible by putting out my questions
[SPEAKER_06]: and my annoyance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being pretty much annoying and trying to
force them to help me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, this is an effort of everybody
involved with this taxpayer.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, then you're not contributing to
this paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to also pay my respect to the
19th century capitalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this metal foundation started my
research in this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, since I started from the end,
I'm going to give the title to the talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we look at the background like
this and then we go to the field,
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody sees something different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people see volcanoes, some people see
snow, meaning about skiing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I go there, I see plants,
mostly big trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even more, I see the specific part of
the plant, the conductive tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I look at it, I always ask the
question, what makes plants a plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes the plant to be a single
organism that has hundreds or sometimes
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of the crystal organs placed on
the branches and millions of rootlets in
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how they function all together as a
unit?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they function?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to have a neural network.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to have a brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, from our animal perspective,
we think everybody should have somehow
[SPEAKER_06]: trusted the signals of the environment to
make it respond to the environment in a
[SPEAKER_06]: coordinated manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have the plant that doesn't
have that kind of ability to anticipate or
[SPEAKER_06]: perceive the environmental cues,
shift them to one place, digest them,
[SPEAKER_06]: make this information decision,
and then spread them back to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, we need to do this or that in this
particular region of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I think about it, what makes
plants a plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: The most amazing part of this is that
whatever we go to field right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially around the corner, we go to the
forest and you see not plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: you just see the tubes that conduct water,
covered by bark.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tubes that conduct sugar under the
bark during the summer, right now they're
[SPEAKER_06]: not doing much, but they just stand there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see basically big conductive tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the huge microfluidic device.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to give you the kind of a feeling what
is this scale of this microfluidic device,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can look at these numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four million kilometers of tubes are in
the single eucalyptus tree, which is 10
[SPEAKER_06]: times the distance to the moon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where the trees put all the tubes from
a tree, we reach the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's eight minutes of light travel,
which is a huge amount of microfluidic
[SPEAKER_06]: system, way more than humans have in the
form of their vessels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this zygote tissue is also matched by
the, that would be shorter, by flying
[SPEAKER_06]: transported, transported sugars from the.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is, it means that those transport
tissue, they have to somehow, in my
[SPEAKER_06]: opinion, at least interact and create a
system response.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is this part that we call right now,
this new word, emergent properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: This system of the tree has this emergent
properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: This transfer system has emergent
properties of coordination among those
[SPEAKER_06]: distal parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the observation that I have over the
last 10 years of working with plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: that almost all the biological responses
that I've studied have always byproduct in
[SPEAKER_06]: forms of the hydraulic properties
adjustment or changes in hydraulic
[SPEAKER_06]: properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it's heat, roots, xylem tissue,
blood, there's always, no matter what kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of element we study, whether it's
nitrates, sugar transport, whatever we
[SPEAKER_06]: study, there's always a component of
hydraulics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I try to convey the message that this
hydraulic component may be the most
[SPEAKER_06]: dynamic part of the microbe of this macro
fluidic system that can allow for
[SPEAKER_06]: well-increased well-being of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, we can make the plant function
in more efficient way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the puzzle that we have is we have this
whole, that the difficulty of studying
[SPEAKER_06]: this kind of question or this kind of
paradigm is that we have to study,
[SPEAKER_06]: there is some kind of stick to show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, we have this puzzle at
different scales, from molecular scale,
[SPEAKER_06]: subcellular scale, to true to medium
scales of several centimeters when we have
[SPEAKER_06]: tissues interact, to whole, let's say,
in my case, I like three, so to whole
[SPEAKER_06]: three.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how we can combine all those elements
together is a big question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Challenge, technical challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, I will try to explain or not
say, just put you in it through the way
[SPEAKER_06]: how I thought about it, why I came up with
this idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: This microbe system has to be a part of
the informational system, literally by
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at three different unique parts of
the three different unique responses of
[SPEAKER_06]: plants to particular environmental
triggers, and how they translate to water,
[SPEAKER_06]: hydraulics of plants, and how they can
eventually meet this premise of emergent
[SPEAKER_06]: properties of the whole plant's scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go through three examples,
root nitrate update, sugar transport,
[SPEAKER_06]: and concentration of CO3.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the first.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about root update and nitrate update
by roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the observations that I made
recently was that when we apply nitrate to
[SPEAKER_06]: previously a little bit starved nitrate
starved plants, of course, nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: presence will trigger nitrate
transporters, and nitrate will be taken
[SPEAKER_06]: out by root.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, we notice that plant
increase extremely, I mean extremely,
[SPEAKER_06]: but within very few seconds, within 30
seconds, changes its hydraulic properties
[SPEAKER_06]: of roots by allowing more water to flow
through the membranes of parent muscles
[SPEAKER_06]: and roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this two slides show tomato and
cucumber, and the A and B shows tomato and
cucumber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cucumber responds to nitrate addition to
the solid solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the blue line shows the increase
versus the green line, shows the increase
[SPEAKER_06]: of flux through the root, completely
unrelated to any changes of driving force.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was not caused by changing driving
force, any pressure gradient or responding
[SPEAKER_06]: gradient across the root.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just changed by the cellular
adjustment of cell, cell properties,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the lower graph, shows the test
of the half-time water flow through cell
[SPEAKER_06]: membrane in the parent muscles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bars show the application of nitrate
to roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: We require, require cost to drop in the
resistance of membrane to water flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have this nitrate application
resulting in the change in the properties
[SPEAKER_06]: of, hydraulic properties of flux.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what causes at the molecular level
this change?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are talking about, of course,
aquaporates, but we were trying to find
[SPEAKER_06]: out what, how this signal of nitrate
transdehyde, what creates a change in
[SPEAKER_06]: micro, in membrane component, what part of
this nitrate transfer flux creates a
[SPEAKER_06]: change.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, we used the tank state
thread, tank state applications to decide
[SPEAKER_06]: whether we're trying to block the nitrate
assimilation path with tank state,
[SPEAKER_06]: hoping that maybe some byproduct of
nitrate from nitrate assimilation path
[SPEAKER_06]: will let us decide which part of the
pathway is responsible for adjusting what
[SPEAKER_06]: the component of the water wrapping may
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we successfully stopped the response
of nitrate on cucumber, but not on tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: with tank state.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we checked in both cases the nitrate,
active nitrate, the nitrate assimilation
[SPEAKER_06]: path was blocked in both cases,
but in case of the cucumber, we also
[SPEAKER_06]: noticed that we blocked the uptake nitrate
transfer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did a very nice, simple experiment
to see which part of the pathway is
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible for the, for changes in
aquaporate activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because tank state in tomato, the upper
one, shows the nitrate in tomato,
[SPEAKER_06]: tank state in tomato blocked the nitrate
assimilation path, but did not do anything
[SPEAKER_06]: to, to block the aquaporate activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we changed, when in cucumber,
when in cucumber we blocked nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: transporters, at the same time we blocked
the activity of aquaporates at the same
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did not block that, they did not
respond to the presence of nitrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was obvious that nitrate inside the
cell is responsible for increasing the
[SPEAKER_06]: contact transfer.
[SPEAKER_06]: of the membrane.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we injected nitrate through the back
wall of the cells and we get back the,
[SPEAKER_06]: we activate aquaporates and increase the
water flow to the cell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this gave us a kind of a short insight
of the cell, but at that point I,
[SPEAKER_06]: as I am a whole plant biologist,
I kind of let this go to the people in my
[SPEAKER_06]: lab to try to study what molecular level
responses are involved in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is an overview of the concept
that we had, is that when there is no
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrate present, plant basically takes up
water and nitrates that they are
[SPEAKER_06]: developing in the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: However,
[SPEAKER_06]: when, suddenly one place nitrate,
which is a mobile nutrient in the soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: shows up due to the rain event or some
activity of microbes around one part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the root system.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant would like to take it up,
but it triggers up the nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: transporters, upregulates nitrate
transporters, might lead to nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: presence in the surface of the root.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be beneficial for plants to
bring more nitrate toward the root by
[SPEAKER_06]: increasing the flux rate of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the plant can change the flux rate
toward the root, then it would be
[SPEAKER_06]: automatically increasing availability of
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a feed forward effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when, over time, plant nitrates in
this mobile nutrient will shift from one
[SPEAKER_06]: spot to another, plant can turn off one
resistance, I mean turn off the uptake of
[SPEAKER_06]: water in one part of the root system,
move it to another part when the nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: is present.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, benefit from having the flow
rate toward the root.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was the concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we then tested it on hydroponics when
we built a new system, two roots,
[SPEAKER_06]: speed root system, two balances,
and then we provide one part of the root
[SPEAKER_06]: with the nitrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see on those graphs that there
was immediately met by increased water
[SPEAKER_06]: uptake from this part of the root,
but the other part dropped down the uptake
[SPEAKER_06]: of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plant is collecting water from
where the nitrate is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we rotated the roots,
they immediately switched back and nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: began to plant with nitrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: The root with nitrate presence was able to
take up more water with nitrate when the
[SPEAKER_06]: other one was shut down, which gives us
the feeling that this is an interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: example of seemingly unrelated processes,
nitrate uptake and water uptake,
[SPEAKER_06]: when one is really increasing the
potential of the other, turning on the
[SPEAKER_06]: water up from nitrate gave the plant a
chance to benefit from taking up more
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrate when the nitrate is available.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also it gives us this static
distribution of roots in the soil with
[SPEAKER_06]: mobile nutrient that can shift from place
to place or can be triggered by
[SPEAKER_06]: micro-galactics in different places.
[SPEAKER_06]: This can allow the plant, despite being
immobile, to chase nutrients by adaptation
[SPEAKER_06]: of physiological activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is one of the examples of how the
plant can adjust hydraulics to seemingly
[SPEAKER_06]: unrelated physiological activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can put together two pieces of
puzzle at two different levels,
[SPEAKER_06]: from molecular or cellular level to whole
root or part of the root system level.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other example that comes from my study
is the interaction between sugar transport
[SPEAKER_06]: and enzyme transport.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very simplified view of what
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when sugar is transported,
there is expectation that there is some
[SPEAKER_06]: ions being recycled over time to maintain
the sugar flow from the sugar to the root.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interestingly, when this happens,
those ions go from Ploem to xylem tubes
[SPEAKER_06]: and flow up back to the cells at the top
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is interesting because the
[SPEAKER_06]: presence of ions in xylem can change the
resistance of xylem itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those tubes that are deployed in xylem,
they conduct water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for a long time, they were assumed
that they are permanent features,
[SPEAKER_06]: that they act like pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But 10 years ago, we found out that they
do not act like pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are also dynamic.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can adapt their resistance to water
flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can adapt resistance to presence of
ions in xylem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 10 come from xylem interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the graphs that shows
increasing flow rate of, in xylem,
[SPEAKER_06]: different concentration of potassium in
the cell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And percent of relative flow rate due to
the xylem tubes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was later on we showed that this
is really related to border pit membrane
[SPEAKER_06]: properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are border pits that link with our
links between two adjacent vessels in the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, one of them here, one of those
border pits.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the border pits here is open and
you can see through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this water flows to one side,
to the other side of the vessel,
[SPEAKER_06]: to another vessel element through those
border pits that are composed of,
[SPEAKER_06]: they are hybrid materials composed of many
fibers, gels, and potentially some pores.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we look closer at those pores,
they are, this is a recent AFM analysis of
[SPEAKER_06]: the border pit itself, when those two
fuzzy images shows two different moments,
[SPEAKER_06]: two different properties of border pit
membranes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one on the left shows that membrane is
produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, I think this is,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is the elevation image of the AFM
atomic force microscopy when we probe the
[SPEAKER_06]: surface of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that this is kind of a
flat surface, very difficult to
[SPEAKER_06]: distinguish anything underneath this fiber
structure of the border pit membrane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hidden under the gel kind of
material.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we expose it to feed the
micromolar concentration of KCO,
[SPEAKER_06]: this gel in those border pits,
it collapses, making it much more strict
[SPEAKER_06]: and much harder in the surface and much
more features on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have potential to see the more that it
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fibers, these are black lines here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, and also you can see, you can see
kind of long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick clarification, you said 50
micromolar, but it's not 50.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meaty molar, meaty molar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meaty molar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, in this case it's 50 meaty molar,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we wanted to get it very strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually in plants it goes from few,
from two meaty molar to seven meaty molar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it's, we wanted to see the big change
and we did see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this change collapsed the gel to make
the surface much stiffer, but at the same
[SPEAKER_06]: time much more permeable to water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is at the micro scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those images were showing this LF,
this interaction of ions being recycled
[SPEAKER_06]: from flow and that micro scale level
change at the structure of border pit
[SPEAKER_06]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we look at the whole plant level,
we can try to understand why plant bother
[SPEAKER_06]: to change this micro fluidic, properties
of this micro fluidic systems for,
[SPEAKER_06]: is there any physiological meaning for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or biological meaning for well being of
the whole plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: To do it, we did a long time ago,
Peter Meltzer here, we did this study of
[SPEAKER_06]: when we cook the plant, this was a tobacco
plant, we took parts of this item,
[SPEAKER_06]: attached them to tubes, and then we flow,
in one case, DI water in other way,
[SPEAKER_06]: DI water and then we substituted DI water
with artificial sap composed of true,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever we can read in the book,
with artificial sap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the moment we substituted with
the artificial sap, the part with the
[SPEAKER_06]: substitution was increased dramatically
the flux rate of water from the particular
[SPEAKER_06]: part of the plant, allowing to say that
the composition of sap can really change
[SPEAKER_06]: the rate of utilization of water through
this particular part of the site.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we go back to the water, the
resistance, the resistance increased and
[SPEAKER_06]: the water update decreased from this
particular zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a really complicated system.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was everything so far was done kind
of outside the plant or in case of with
[SPEAKER_06]: artificial sap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here I wanted to decide, is it true that
by dealing with or changing the property
[SPEAKER_06]: of transporting flow, I can induce changes
in xyland rate of water delivery to
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a setup where plant was
tortured in extreme ways by the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: it was pressurized in the roots,
it was on the balance, then we changed the
[SPEAKER_06]: light condition, humidity to help to,
and to affect the flux.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was also, the flux was girdled
to change the way that the plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: to induce the flux, to force plants to
stop transporting xyland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eventually we are able to measure
between two transducers, T1 and T2,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are able to measure resistance of the
xyland and also determine from the rate of
[SPEAKER_06]: water flow in the plant, which allowed us
to find out that indeed the moment when
[SPEAKER_06]: xyland was disturbed, the resistance of
xyland increased dramatically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is completely related one to the
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the plant can recycle ions,
[SPEAKER_06]: it can maintain preferable xyland flux
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it cannot transport ions, I mean to
recycle ions from xyland to xyland,
[SPEAKER_06]: the resistance of xyland to water flow
dramatically increases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how does this play a role in the small
plant environment interaction?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an example that I can think about,
but I would like to later on to study in
[SPEAKER_06]: detail.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in shape conditions, with all those
aspects of low photosynthetic activity,
[SPEAKER_06]: low export rate, low ionic circulation,
this result in high resistance to water
[SPEAKER_06]: flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those parts of plants that are in
shape, they will not get water.
[SPEAKER_06]: In opposite situation, when one part of
the plant is exposed to sun, this entire
[SPEAKER_06]: activity transport and recycle ions
increases the capability or capacity of
[SPEAKER_06]: xyland for water transport and can enhance
water delivery to most productive plant
[SPEAKER_06]: parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is again a system where those
meaningful changes or unrelated part of
[SPEAKER_06]: plant biology like plant transport and
recycling of ions can force or can induce
[SPEAKER_06]: the increased productivity of plant in
areas when plant really needs this
[SPEAKER_06]: particular sun situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can envision that over time when
sun is going in the forest, different
[SPEAKER_06]: parts of the tree crown will be exposed to
sun at different times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the those that are getting most
light, they will be most supplied with
[SPEAKER_06]: water and ions from the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another part that we can put
together again in cellular level or
[SPEAKER_06]: subcellular level information with tissue
level adjustments that can improve plant
[SPEAKER_06]: performance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next example is coming from leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I am studying
currently so I don't have a nice
[SPEAKER_06]: description of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when leaves are composed of a lot
of cells, mesophilic cells and conductive
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue cells, and when we look at them,
the interesting aspect that we are finding
[SPEAKER_06]: out right now is that presence of CO2
inside cells changes the aquaporin
[SPEAKER_06]: activity in the cells too.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is again a byproduct of aquaporin
activity that allows or stops water being
[SPEAKER_06]: delivered to amygdala cells or changes
resistance of water being delivered from
[SPEAKER_06]: xyla to amygdala cells of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the interesting part is that the more
CO2 there is in the leaf, the more
[SPEAKER_06]: resistant is the pathway between xyla and
stomata.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the more resistant is this pathway,
it means that stomata has harder time to
[SPEAKER_06]: get water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is any loss of water,
they will shot faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how this would play the whole
well-being of the leaf, it might be that
[SPEAKER_06]: when, it might be that leaves that are in
the shade, i.e.
[SPEAKER_06]: they are not productive, they have
increased the level of CO2 because there
[SPEAKER_06]: is no much photosynthesis in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if those leaves can reduce the loss of
water, then they will automatically
[SPEAKER_06]: preserve this water for most productive
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they reduce the water loss,
then they will be able to utilize this
[SPEAKER_06]: water in other parts of the plant,
similar to adjustment of resistance in
[SPEAKER_06]: xyla.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the third puzzle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, two puzzles together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you have cellular component,
CO2 uptake, but at the same time you're
[SPEAKER_06]: translating CO2 to aquaporin activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And uptake is the ability of the leaves to
photosynthesize and loss of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this case, we have the legal
elements, smaller research components,
[SPEAKER_06]: getting us to another step, emerging
properties of an entire system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how those legal parts can create a
plant that is responsive to environmental
[SPEAKER_06]: cues and trigger some higher level,
organismal level adjustments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: How to understand the vascular network
that is composed of millions of kilometers
[SPEAKER_06]: of vessels and millions of cells that
provide capacitors for water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are those resistances between
cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just a bigger picture,
but this is just a small part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: equation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to start it, we have this problem that
all this research has to be done on
[SPEAKER_06]: vessels that conduct water under tension.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any disturbance to it makes it a fact
that it just stops the transport,
[SPEAKER_06]: or they're done in the flow, which is
under positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But any disturbance to it also stops the
flow at least temporarily.
[SPEAKER_06]: And interestingly, anything that I try to
do is met by this fact that this is from
[SPEAKER_06]: the methodological challenges.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very well confirmed by all the
reviewers that I have to meet in my way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is no additional chart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just send you letters that are longer
than your paper saying why something's
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong with the methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they never say what I
should be proved.
[SPEAKER_06]: They often criticize me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fighting with it, I have to why this is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because scale is about preservation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to observe something in
micro-scale and somehow translate it into
[SPEAKER_06]: tens of meters of deep tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as I mentioned before,
everything in the plant that we transport
[SPEAKER_06]: is intracellular.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is really no extracellular
transport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Xylem vessels are cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And black stuff is inside, not outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Black stuff is inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is small.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are under tension.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're under high pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we can do, I tried.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a long-term project.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it started many years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that Abe Strode will recognize
this legal device.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his first attempt to measure for
this created tension in the bio-medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: device when we're trying to measure load
of generation, transpiration in microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: device and measure tension for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was not silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was this PDMS.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the moment we did this,
the first thing we always get was embolism
[SPEAKER_06]: at the time when we connected to the tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an embolism and no more.
[SPEAKER_06]: This didn't function well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next step I did with Xavier Noblan
was to develop an artificial leaf where we
[SPEAKER_06]: were trying to generate fluxes not through
the leaf reality, but through the
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those examples of what I tried to
do, they ended up with some kind of a more
[SPEAKER_06]: or less published material, except that
they did not yet contribute to answering
[SPEAKER_06]: major questions about how it functioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one, this vapor, this evaporative
device allowed us to create a better
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding of vein spacing in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what drives the white hole leaf at
eight millimeters of vein?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight millimeters of veins per square
millimeter of leaf tissue versus,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's say, in cobalt that had one
millimeter of vein per millimeter of
[SPEAKER_06]: surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: This device allowed us to design or better
understand the scaling of the nation
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other part, so this is kind of an
overview of method that I tried to develop
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is biomechanical device that we
tried to understand the flow and flow in
[SPEAKER_06]: using the first microfluidic device when
we were able to separate two micro-tunnels
[SPEAKER_06]: with a semi-permeable membrane and analyze
the rate of flow versus concentration of
[SPEAKER_06]: sugars in size of the flow tubes,
which gave us the ability to predict why
[SPEAKER_06]: certain plants have the tubes that are
like, why cucumber has a 50-micro diameter
[SPEAKER_06]: flow tube when the eucalyptus tree has,
in the trunk, has about 15-micrometer
[SPEAKER_06]: diameter tube, or why tomato has
25-micrometer tube, despite the different
[SPEAKER_06]: sizes, different distances that this part
is transported at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a scaling law that we
developed when we can predict the leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: size, i.e., the loading zone for
photosynthesized to the plant is related
[SPEAKER_06]: to, I mean, times one-third of the power
of the stem length gives us the predicted
[SPEAKER_06]: radius of the plant tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an interesting finding that
it spans across a lot of different sizes
[SPEAKER_06]: of plants from arachnopsis to the
eucalyptus tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the biomechanical parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I try to develop methods that will
allow me to look inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of the methods that I call
the remote access methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is remote access to flow and flow,
where I load the dye into the leaves and
[SPEAKER_06]: am able to follow up due to the bleaching
of dye, the rate of movement of dye in
[SPEAKER_06]: flow, and allow determining the rate of
flow, and hopefully also to decide later
[SPEAKER_06]: on, not right now yet, but later on to
create the, to expose those plants to
[SPEAKER_06]: environmental triggers to see how flow
rate directly affects other particular
[SPEAKER_06]: hydraulic properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another part I try to loop into
the leaves when I try to measure the rate
[SPEAKER_06]: of flow of water into the leaf to
determine if I trigger a particular part,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I change the availability of CO2 in it,
how this water flows in particular parts
[SPEAKER_06]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the leaf, this is the stem.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the work that we did on trying to
look inside the stem of the plant using
[SPEAKER_06]: MRI.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this movie shows, it's kind of very
short, you can see this black,
[SPEAKER_06]: this little black speck going through the
plant right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an embolism formation in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this plant was under stress,
this plant was in MRI, and at one point we
[SPEAKER_06]: got disturbance from us to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a particular event that showed
that there was embolism that later on
[SPEAKER_06]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: So MRI proved to be very hard to loop into
the well being and water distribution in
[SPEAKER_06]: the stem, which gave us the ability to
look at what happens to water.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, blue is not water,
but blue is air.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens to air inside the plant
during the embolism events?
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it distributed in three-dimensional
scale all the time and how it disappears?
[SPEAKER_06]: It proves, first of all, that embolism can
be revealed, but also shows us that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: loop macroscale and microscale events that
happens in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another, now we're going below
ground, this is another part of this leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is root access where
[SPEAKER_06]: we make an on-time observation of water
update by root.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that water disappears from
root and shows, we can calculate how much
[SPEAKER_06]: water at what time is being taken up by
one particular plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the two pictures here.
[SPEAKER_06]: After two hours, the color, brighter
color, the red, more water was being taken
[SPEAKER_06]: up at that particular time from particular
zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see that two hours in this
particular system, we have to shift the
[SPEAKER_06]: water update from the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this technique is developed to
hope to make it possible to put together
[SPEAKER_06]: some additional other nitrates to this
system and see how this nitrate really
[SPEAKER_06]: influence water update on the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem, okay, so there's another
part, so there's more of a, there's
[SPEAKER_06]: insider insight, I call it, because then
we try to look inside the plant and do a
[SPEAKER_06]: microscale.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have different small levels to see
droplets in vessels or how the leaf look
[SPEAKER_06]: like inside during the active draft.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the SEM pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they not really show the active or the
real life elements, but I think they gave
[SPEAKER_06]: us the feeling how the environment looks
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can try to model it later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get the true dimensions from the
system and learn how they interact with
[SPEAKER_06]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the root access.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two plants, this is a micro probe that we
poked into the zygote.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pressure drop here shows that I
was poking, going in the zygote pressure
[SPEAKER_06]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eventually I force it to generate some
tension and most likely embolizes a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit because it's a deep probe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then over time, interestingly,
the pressure probe reached a higher and
[SPEAKER_06]: higher pressure of almost two bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end, I was not in the room at
that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one was in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It suddenly hit what I call the repeating
moment, go down to negative pressures and
[SPEAKER_06]: embolize again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an example of direct practice
design and observation of embolism
[SPEAKER_06]: repeating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And last, the moment, this is the last
kind of slide here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to overlay all those physical
measurements of the system on whole
[SPEAKER_06]: transcriptome analysis, check what genes
are being triggered at particular physical
[SPEAKER_06]: events during the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we force particulars,
force embolism, this is a slide about
[SPEAKER_06]: embolism repair, if we force plants to
emboli and then wait for repeating,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can check what pathways and what
particular processes are being upregulated
[SPEAKER_06]: due to this response.
[SPEAKER_06]: So each of those techniques that I use
requires some kind of a miracle to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each one is extremely complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I call every research a miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we have 10 different aspects,
to measure simultaneously, it's a huge
[SPEAKER_06]: miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we have to measure 50 or 60 different
elements simultaneously at a big macro
[SPEAKER_06]: scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's extremely interesting from the
perspective of how to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how to do it here this
way, going around asking people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And put together the picture of how this
plant is capable of responding to a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: stimuli.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how this lot of stimuli spread across
the hydraulic system and how they interact
[SPEAKER_06]: with all the kind of stimuli in the
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: How they create this, I call it
hydroinformatics.
[SPEAKER_06]: How they do this hydroinformatics that
allow the plant to interact with the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment and create the shape of a tree
that is well adjusted to the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how those changes influence the fluxes
inside the plant and make the plant work
[SPEAKER_06]: all together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can go to the beginning,
which is the micro-masters of
[SPEAKER_06]: micro-poetics, and say, how does hydraulic
integration block a lot of plant
[SPEAKER_06]: responses?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or make plant vascular system to be the
dynamic coordinator of everything that
[SPEAKER_06]: happens in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very narrow, very short, very dense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I've got too long, hopefully,
for the five minutes.
There is no questions.
I will not be able to answer.
Any questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this
is basically the next step.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am learning MATLAB, but it will take me
a few years, probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just looking rather for people that
think of performing or for themselves,
[SPEAKER_06]: but just using some application that
provides.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, this is, as I said,
this is a very difficult problem from the
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective of combining all those
measurements into one big system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time we try to measure
something, it's one miracle.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have 50 sensors on a plant,
I have 50 miracles to happen
[SPEAKER_06]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting really difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So modeling is going to be a big part of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use models to even model the bio.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need devices where we know everything
about the system, and we still have model
[SPEAKER_06]: parts of it to understand what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in these, it's been more difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, the internal structure of
leaves makes it more difficult to model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do
[SPEAKER_06]: you have an hypothesis about how CO2
affects chlorine?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, as I said, this is how we started
to do it recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have the hypothesis of how
the, I don't have it clear view,
[SPEAKER_06]: how those events of the nitrate uptake,
how they direct the uptake of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would require probably one or two
graduate students to direct analysis of
[SPEAKER_06]: expressions of genes or activity of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't even have to start thinking
about the signaling molecules.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to be responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can probably predict whether
concentration of sugars are important or
[SPEAKER_06]: whether pH in the cell walls due to CO2
concentration might be important,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a possibility because pH was
shown to affect aquaporin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So increased CO2 level changes pH of water
in the apoplasts might influence
[SPEAKER_06]: aquaporin.
[SPEAKER_06]: But which part of it is responsible for
this effect, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CO2 might also affect pH in the
scientifically?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can affect, yeah, I mean, on the way
to, or protocapsules.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there is a lot of things that CO2
can affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a very general question, but the
experiments that you do are almost seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be directed toward trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably because, but in any case,
do you do similar experiments on
[SPEAKER_01]: herbaceous plants, really small plants in
these quality differences?
[SPEAKER_06]: I show trees because I like them,
but unfortunately, most of them my work
[SPEAKER_06]: was done on herbaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I do for semi-term, but we work
with cucumber, tomato, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_06]: soybean, apoplar, and many other trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have kind of a question really,
not specific plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I have a question, and I go upstairs
to the greenhouse on the roof,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I find a plant, it's good for me,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Learn the name later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really don't mind what I've studied
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be any plant that is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And often we have, I just go there and
just take the first plant that I can,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, this looks nice, this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I ask the people what they think.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are different, I'm not a plant
specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like trees, since I work with Arnold
and Roberto, I like trees, so I always
[SPEAKER_06]: show the trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems to me one of the problems with
modeling is you latch on to some idea,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you model everything around that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, you may have owned
something else that might be more
[SPEAKER_07]: important.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the instance that struck me is when
you had shade versus sun leave,
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves in the shade versus in the sun,
most of the water was going to the leaf in
[SPEAKER_07]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: You suggested that this was because the
leaf was photosynthesizing, altered the
[SPEAKER_07]: level of CO2, the CO2 altered the water
flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the most important thing with regards
to the level of transpiration is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And your shade leaf is not going to be at
such a high temperature as the sun leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you not explain this entire movement
on the basis of temperature influence on
[SPEAKER_07]: transpiration, rather than, again,
worrying about the small changes you're
[SPEAKER_07]: likely to get in CO2?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to explain the level of
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to explain the resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the sun temperature,
there will be more transpiration in the
[SPEAKER_06]: sun leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have a constant resistance,
let's say one, the drop of pressure with
[SPEAKER_06]: particular level of flow, you would have,
I don't know, another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say one megapascal drop across the
pathway.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you can drop this resistance
half, then for the same transpiration
[SPEAKER_06]: rate, your dropping pressure would be on
the half.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your plant would be able to keep the
matter open to sustain this transpiration
[SPEAKER_06]: without dropping the pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm trying to say is not how does
this influence the transpiration rate,
[SPEAKER_06]: but how a plant can redistribute limited
resources between parts of plants to most
[SPEAKER_06]: productive ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I wanted the transpiring as much,
but I wanted to do the low pressure drop
[SPEAKER_06]: so they don't need to drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you increase resistance, the load is
suddenly, suddenly there will be not
[SPEAKER_06]: enough water capacity, transport capacity
to reside in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's no matter how it's shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Transpiration will be the same,
but there will be no production because
[SPEAKER_06]: there is no CO2 out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not about how much water goes to
particular parts, but how a plant can
[SPEAKER_06]: manipulate and redistribute water between
the parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the beginning, you were talking
about thousands of buds and repeated parts
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was immediately thinking of e-tis,
and that was sort of, to some degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a high organism, all these
different individually capable parts,
[SPEAKER_02]: but somehow achieving coordination.
[SPEAKER_02]: To what extent do you think that as you're
modeling the resistances, your examples
[SPEAKER_02]: tended to focus on sort of the proximal
functional aspects of what was happening
[SPEAKER_02]: locally in the chamber of resistance,
but what extent do you see that as sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: a long distance communication pattern,
sort of like the V-dance, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns of resistance and the resulting
hydraulic properties, patterns of water
[SPEAKER_02]: potential, are actually sort of a
communications network that allows the
[SPEAKER_02]: different parts of the plant to
coordinate?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I said, this is a developing
project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do think that there were a lot of
capacitors on this schematic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, if you have this system
with some capacitor cells and certain
[SPEAKER_06]: capacitors, the spread of hydraulic signal
or changes in the distribution of tension
[SPEAKER_06]: in the tree or changes in distribution of
pressure in the soil will not be
[SPEAKER_06]: instantaneous across the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will happen in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then depending on the disturbance
level, they can disappear at certain
[SPEAKER_06]: distance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, the degree of the response or the
way the plant is constructed or the
[SPEAKER_06]: capacitors of the system, they will
influence the spread of hydraulic
[SPEAKER_06]: adjustment of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyway, this is, I think that this
hydraulic insert is kind of a fast dynamic
[SPEAKER_06]: first level response.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be later much by all kind of
chemical responses that are required by
[SPEAKER_06]: physical delivery of something from one
part of the plant to another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is probably another level of
response that I am not studying,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it will be very interesting to see how
it changes in distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fast response much later is much later
on by the hormone distribution and other
[SPEAKER_06]: signal in molecule distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that it's not on the short
distance local change, but it's spreading.
[SPEAKER_06]: If one part of the root changes the water
potential inside the root, this signal,
[SPEAKER_06]: or I would call it a signal, but the
change in one part, because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: interconnected, will influence
distribution of potentials or tension in
[SPEAKER_06]: entire systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I want to thank you for
really a thought provoking type of a
[SPEAKER_05]: seminar and really a cider all the way to
the kind of 20 to more than four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: bases.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the very first section that you had
with the root uptake and the nitrite,
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe I just missed some of the
details, but what was the concentration
[SPEAKER_05]: where you're seeing these influx or the
changes in the flux ring?
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending on the plant, we were trying
to use plants that are having less nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: than in the crop plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically between one and below one
millimolar of nitrate in the field
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we change it to about one
millimolar, they were already responding
[SPEAKER_06]: to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later on we used basically 0.5 millimolar
and 5 millimolar as a megabit faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we tried to use a bit more
nitrite-fiber in the concentration of
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrate than in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: How rapid on the response to the internal
resistance in the leaf with the sun versus
[SPEAKER_00]: shade, how quickly would that respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we have, for example,
clouds go over or the sun moves and leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: go in and out of shade, how quickly did
that response occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was it equally reversible at the same
rate?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean the aquaporins in the leaf in
shade?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have right now the dynamics of it,
how fast it happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we are at the level of
enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can measure the response within several
minutes right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can take it faster, but I cannot
get higher time resolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we see the first evidence of it within
several minutes in aquaporin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you keep apart the effect of the
nitrate on the root water uptake and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the effect of the nitrate on the nitrate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did, I cut the roots, applied the
nitrate at the same concentration,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I cut the effect of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 10% or less versus the fluxes that
were manipulated by nitrate to undamaged
[SPEAKER_06]: roots that are 40 or 60%, which I
suggested it was mostly resulted from the
[SPEAKER_06]: root.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the resistance of the,
radial resistance of the root in this
[SPEAKER_06]: particular case is about 50 times higher
than the resistance of internal zygons.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 10% can zygons translate to less than
100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just means comparing to what the
plant was doing in response to nitrate and
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have a second question to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about the root catheter right in
the sphere zone where there's a gel there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that responding to ions and affecting
water absorption at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have you had a chance to throw like
different salts onto the system to see if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was trying to analyze where water is
being taken up by root.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing was being taken up at the zone
of, at least in the roots that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: studying, in the zone of root catheter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everything was behind, very close to
superized zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 80 to 90% of water was flowing close
to superized zone when the tip of root,
[SPEAKER_06]: the growing part of the root, was
responsible for less than 5% of water
[SPEAKER_06]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even big changes in the cath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: the budget will be here through tomorrow
if you would like to.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
