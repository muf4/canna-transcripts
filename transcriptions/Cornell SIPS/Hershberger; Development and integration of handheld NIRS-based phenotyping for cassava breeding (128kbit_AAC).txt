[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today I'm going to be talking about a
project that I've been working on for
[SPEAKER_03]: about the past year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just in the middle of it still,
so don't have any end conclusions,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I hope you enjoy listening to my
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first I'll start off by talking about
the project that I'm working under.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the FinoApps project is a group of
computer programmers and plant scientists
[SPEAKER_03]: who are working together directly with
breeders to develop apps, smartphone apps,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the phenotyping of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: These apps will then be deployed through
breeder networks, especially in developing
[SPEAKER_03]: countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the crops that the FinoApps
project is especially interested in is
[SPEAKER_03]: cassava.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talk a lot about cassava in this
department, but I thought I'd go over it
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cassava is both an industrial and a food
crop, and it's a staple for over 800
[SPEAKER_03]: million people, especially in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primary breeding targets of cassava are
pest and disease resistance, yield and
[SPEAKER_03]: field performance, and dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I'm going to be focusing mostly on
dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cassava root dry matter content is the
proportion or the percent of the root that
[SPEAKER_03]: is not water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after the water leaves the root,
it's the percent that's left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's typically around 20 to 45 percent,
and up to 90 percent of that can be
[SPEAKER_03]: starch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It directly affects the dry yield of the
cassava roots and also the food quality or
[SPEAKER_03]: the mouth feel, which then affects the
consumer acceptance and the variety
[SPEAKER_03]: adoption rate of cassava.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in talking to breeders, I found over
and over that this trait is notoriously
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult, time-consuming, laborious to
measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two methods that are typically used
are specific gravity and the oven method.
[SPEAKER_03]: The specific gravity method here on the
left involves weighing the roots in air
[SPEAKER_03]: and in water, and then plugging those
values into an equation to get the dry
[SPEAKER_03]: matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: The oven method requires transport from
the field to a laboratory setting where
[SPEAKER_03]: the samples are dried in an oven after
shredding, and this requires consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity, which might not always be
present in a given location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because of the challenges,
the time put in and the labor put in,
[SPEAKER_03]: different breeding programs have been
looking at a new technique to phenotype
[SPEAKER_03]: dry matter content a little quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is near-infrared spectroscopy,
or NIRS.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been shown to be highly predictive
of dry matter in cassava roots,
[SPEAKER_03]: and because of this, it's being routinely
used at SEAT in Columbia for the
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotyping of dry matter content in
cassava.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the validated spectrometers that have
been looked at so far are prohibitively
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive for most small breeding programs
to afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of this, we're looking into the
use of a portable handheld spectrometer
[SPEAKER_03]: called the SIO, which at $300 is a 150 to
200 times price reduction from the 50,000
[SPEAKER_03]: plus that these other spectrometers cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does measure a restricted amount of
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the near-infrared spectrum,
area of the electromagnetic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I'll talk about, we've found this
to also be highly predictive of dry matter
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the spectrometer connects with
Bluetooth to a smartphone app that can
[SPEAKER_03]: then be used by readers and technicians in
the field to collect data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm gonna take a little step back
and talk about what near-infrared
[SPEAKER_03]: spectroscopy is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a method that allows for a
quick and non-destructive analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been used in lots of different
fields, including you can tell medications
[SPEAKER_03]: apart, like counterfeit or
non-counterfeit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in agriculture specifically,
it's been used for cultivar identification
[SPEAKER_03]: for measuring bricks and other traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it is is the spectrometer
measures the reflectance of light in the
[SPEAKER_03]: near-infrared region of the
electromagnetic spectrum, which goes from
[SPEAKER_03]: about 700 to 2,500 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reflectance in this region
represents a complex signal from the
[SPEAKER_03]: physical and chemical properties of
whatever is being scanned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because the signal is complex,
it requires multivariate statistical
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques to be able to decipher what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it also requires the development
of calibration models for use in each and
[SPEAKER_03]: every application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this cultivar identification in beans
will require different model from
[SPEAKER_03]: measuring bricks and apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in my case, this looks like three
main steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, the calibration data is collected,
and then that data is fed as training data
[SPEAKER_03]: into a prediction model development
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once those models are developed,
they can be used for routine analysis in
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this requires protocol optimization to
decide what different steps need to be put
[SPEAKER_03]: into the data collection protocol and also
into the model development pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once the models are developed,
they will also require consistent updating
[SPEAKER_03]: as the phenotype change, as environments
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to zoom in and talk about my
work in steps one, two, and the protocol
[SPEAKER_03]: optimization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have two different breeding programs
that I'm working with, IATA in Nigeria and
[SPEAKER_03]: MACRI in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each with two different years of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, I just have this first year
collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: My analyses for the rest of the
presentation will focus on these trials in
[SPEAKER_03]: Nigeria, which include 129 genotypes total
with two reps each.
[SPEAKER_03]: These data were collected with six roots
per plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roots were sliced in half crossways
and then scanned cross sectionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are more slices than were actually
taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just cut in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: But scan like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those same roots were put in
through the standard operating protocol
[SPEAKER_03]: for the oven method to determine dry
matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was done for each individual
root.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for each root, I have a pairing of
scans and a dry matter content value from
[SPEAKER_03]: the oven method.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were then fed into pre-processing
techniques and then into my model
[SPEAKER_03]: development pipeline, which consisted of
50 iterations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of random split of 70% training and 30%
validation to get a better idea of what
[SPEAKER_03]: different training sets will, what the
effect of different training sets will
[SPEAKER_03]: have on the predictability of the models.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then I looked specifically at the
different pre-processing techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: their effect on the models themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I looked at 12 different techniques
including scattered correction and
[SPEAKER_03]: derivatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And compared them with the raw data
values.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this graph shows from left to right
on the X axis, different pre-processing
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques with raw data on the far left.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top is predictability of the model
with R squared prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bottom is root mean squared error
of prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, there's no
statistically significant difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between the different pre-processing
methods and the raw data itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will use this to inform you on my
model development pipeline moving forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'll keep checking it with different
data sets as the data itself might require
[SPEAKER_03]: different pre-processing methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one other thing that I looked at in the
protocol optimization is the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: roots that I included for plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you remember, I had the dry matter
content for each individual root and I
[SPEAKER_03]: used that in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from left to right, we have one through
six roots per root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the R squared prediction
again and the root mean squared error of
[SPEAKER_03]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are clear advantages to adding
more roots, but there seem to be
[SPEAKER_03]: diminishing returns after about three
roots per plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this again will be used to inform
the future calibration data collection and
[SPEAKER_03]: the SOPs that we develop for breeding
programs to use in their routine
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotyping of dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with this, our final goal is that
routine use of this method in breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, but to get there, we have
additional protocol optimization that I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: like to perform and then the additional
data from the other breeding program in
[SPEAKER_03]: Uganda as well as from 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'd like to evaluate prediction
models across environments and breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally integrate this data type
and the models that I create into Cassava
[SPEAKER_03]: base so that breeders can access them
directly and use them in their breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I'd like to thank my lab and my
great collaborators from the NextGen
[SPEAKER_03]: Cassava project, the pheno apps team and
my committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions for Jenna?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenna, how repeatable are these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try measuring the same roots two
or three or four times?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I scanned each root six times and so
far have been averaging the scans across a
[SPEAKER_03]: root, but I do want to look at the number
of scans per sample to see if that's
[SPEAKER_03]: affecting the results that I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at one scan per root and
comparing it with another scan for the
[SPEAKER_03]: root or averaging two or three to see how
many we should be adding in our protocol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not something I've looked at yet,
but I do plan to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just mentioned six scans per root,
but when you were showing the slices,
[SPEAKER_04]: you said you were really just doing one
slice per root.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just comment on how the size of
the root and where exactly you scan it in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the diameter versus the
longitudinal position?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do those things influence dry matter
and scan?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is whether or where
exactly on the root the scans are taking
[SPEAKER_03]: place and how that affects the results
that I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're taking the root and cutting it in
half crossways in the middle and then
[SPEAKER_03]: taking three scans on each half,
both on the cut surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have not so far looked at different
regions of the roots, so we do know that
[SPEAKER_03]: dry matter can vary from the proximal to
distal end of the root, and that is
[SPEAKER_03]: something else that we want to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have a collaborator at EMBRAFA in
Brazil who's looking at this right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've been talking to him about getting
that data and looking at it, but so far
[SPEAKER_03]: the roots have all been the same age,
roughly the same size, and so that also is
[SPEAKER_03]: not something I've looked at yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the relationship between dry
matter and consumer acceptance?
[SPEAKER_03]: So all that I know about that is
secondhand from breeders and from people
[SPEAKER_03]: who eat cassava, a few of them,
but they all say that the higher dry
[SPEAKER_03]: matter is better, it just feels better in
your mouth, it cooks better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that consumers can tell
whether a root is high or low dry matter
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're eating it, and then it might
mean that they don't buy cassava from that
[SPEAKER_03]: person who sold the low dry matter cassava
to them or something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I haven't done any direct consumer
studies or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's give Jenna another round
of applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
