[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we're a little bit late,
but welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad that you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just to make sure that,
just for the sake of being able to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: each other, that when you're not speaking
or we're not entertaining questions or
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing from growers at your location,
please hit the mute button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilitators, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is our second annual sort of
video conference focusing on transitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PowerPoint that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming that the PowerPoint that
you guys can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot see it, please let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move to just basically a quick overview
again of what our effort has focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been focusing for the last several
years on really trying to help growers
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the use of reduced tillage in
their vegetable operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper northeast, in cooler areas of
the northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been focusing our research and
education efforts with growers on
[SPEAKER_00]: overcoming basic challenges that we know
exist and we're trying to overcome them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at weed management issues,
dealing with soil quality, soil
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensuring that we can actually get timely
harvest of the crops that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dealing with pests and looking at harvest
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been issues with processing crops
that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had conversations around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other area of work that we have and
that we hope to do is to develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: identify equipment or strategies that are
appropriate for all scale requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of, there's a lot of equipment out
there that's available for larger
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that can handle the four row or
six row and higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dealing with the small scale
operations two row type set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been really interested in trying to
work with growers in developing units that
[SPEAKER_00]: are appropriate for that scaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally we want to, we continue
to work to do demonstrations on farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: on station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got basically a really exciting
collaboration now that goes across the
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really test and make, make some of
these demonstrations available to growers
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can actually look and see how our
crops are forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I wanted to do is to
highlight really quickly some of the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got funded recently by Northeast
SARE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus is to look at deep zone
tillage, which we're going to talk a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to actually address a particularly
difficult pest phytophthorcapsacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our reason for taking this on and
looking at this is that we believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil management and soil quality
improvements in doing deep zone tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: will actually reduce the speed of the
development of the disease in fields that
[SPEAKER_00]: are infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have trials that are going on on
farms that have a history of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking for more collaborators
for this coming year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to do is to be able to
look both, we have on station trials at
[SPEAKER_00]: research farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, we do have research
farms that have phytophthorcapsy and in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact have cultivated in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also then doing trials on farm over
three years where we set up fields that
[SPEAKER_00]: are paired with deep zone tillage and then
their traditional conventional tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on those fields, we want to actually
look at soil moisture, soil water
[SPEAKER_00]: management changes in the amount of
saturation that we see in fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, with a susceptible
crop, see if we actually do delay the
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of PCAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that people can harvest for a
longer period in those years, we might
[SPEAKER_00]: have conducive sort of moisture conditions
for the development of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested, and I've put
this out there now, so as we go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the day and we have these conversations
around equipment and management and other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are interested in collaborating
with us, we would welcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking for growers that have
fields with a history of phytophthorcapsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have to, we'd like to have two
fields on any farm so that we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different rotations that people
are using at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to be able to set up fields
where we do zone tillage in part and
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional in the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal is that over the next few
years that you're working with us that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do grow a susceptible crop in these fields
at least once so that we can actually look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the disease onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ourselves, the team will
actually be at your firm and doing soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health tests, looking at soil health,
soil quality, water infiltration,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil moisture retention, and other aspects
of how this system affects soils in those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, we want to be able to
get a sense from all of you who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: these trials as to are you seeing other
benefits of doing zone till around labor
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, practices, management, overall
impressions with the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, particularly in New York,
we have funding to help offset some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to set up a trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have this equipment,
but you want to try zone tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some funding from both New York
Farm Viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were reinstated with our funding with
that group for one year, and at least for
[SPEAKER_00]: one more year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure what the status is of the
New York Farm Viability Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do hope that they continue to
receive funding to help growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between Farm Viability and the,
the New York State Specialty Crop Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, we have cost share funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these funds can be used to sort of
supplement and help lower the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: renting equipment, depending on the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly if you're four row or if you
can handle four row equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would look at renting from a dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a, a network of dealers around
the state that are willing to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can help pay for some of the
transportation costs, the rental costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the per acre costs that they
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have smaller system,
we at, at Cornell have several different
[SPEAKER_00]: units that are two row that we have
available for use on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on Long Island and in Western,
in Eastern New York, there are also two
[SPEAKER_00]: row units that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make that aware,
make you aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in working with us
and doing a trial or setting up a trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely contact your local extension
educator because they would be the ones to
[SPEAKER_00]: help facilitate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could get sort of talk with
you about how to set up one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: trials on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a picture of one of the
units of Jim Kaepern, who's in Western New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, helped us build this unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objective of this trial unit is to
allow you to do some deep placement of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen or if you're using conventional
dry fertilizer, you can put this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two row only, but it is set up to
actually do some fertilizer placement
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also building a very small lighter
weight unit that that will work with
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is using a Yeomans plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plows were developed in New Zealand
for managing moisture on, water on
[SPEAKER_00]: pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they create the same kind of
disturbance for fracturing deep soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that's compacted and creating a nice area
that's worked for planting or for direct
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding or transplanting vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have a two row zone
builder that we have taken to different
[SPEAKER_00]: farms around the state to help them set up
trials and test deep zone tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of the unit that's
in Eastern New York that Chuck Orton has,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know growers have used this unit for
doing demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I just wanted to make sure
that you're aware of the website where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have case studies and other information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous people's experiences from trying
zone tillage on their farms focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we are really focused on
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we get a lot of folks coming that
do field crops as well, and that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't talk about them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I basically just wanted
to give you an overview and a highlight as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the next part of our agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to be able to move into a
conversation on equipment and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance for growers to learn and share from
each other about different equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using and what their experiences
have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy, do you have a copy of the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this part of it, we do actually
have, we do have a power point that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have some pictures that we can put
up based on if growers have anything
[SPEAKER_00]: specific that they want to be talking
about around their equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that point at ten o'clock,
we'll have to break, and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring Thomas Bjorkman in to talk a
little bit more specifically on cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and the tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of growers interested
in tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to have a chance to talk
about that, some cover crops and how we
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate cover crops into these deep zone
tillage systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to focus in on weed
management issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some specific questions that
growers have generated that we've asked
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich Venana to address for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and Robin Belinder have been
talking about some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll be talking to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come back at the end on
more experiences related to fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: management that growers have been using,
different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're connected this morning
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a chance for us to be able to
learn across these different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from growers in other parts of the
region as to what's working and what's not
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, when we break for lunch,
we are happy to buy you lunch today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do encourage you afterwards is that
we want to have time and local
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both if you want to participate in these
trials and work with us to do
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations or to actually get involved
with the phytopther experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do think about that and talk with
your educator about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we want to have a, have local
discussions on what do we need to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other research questions or other
issues need to be addressed to help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers take up these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need feedback from you as you think
about how you might apply these on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we have a short evaluation
that we're asking you to take for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this work is funded by grants and
they always want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we learning?
[SPEAKER_00]: And our, our, what else do we need to do
or focus future work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, what I might, I'd like to do
is I'll quickly check in with folks if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any questions about anything I've
said or any questions about the agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I'll do that is I'll go site to site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with Carol in Western New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any, any questions before we get
started on the equipment section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions before we start looking at and
discussing equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
No.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about new mass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody have questions so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about Long Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: No questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do have one question related to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PowerPoint that was sent with all the
equipment, is that something that you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like us to show before we have that
general discussion or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That PowerPoint has pictures that growers
may refer to in the discussion and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why we sent it along so you could
actually have something to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
