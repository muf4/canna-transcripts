[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year, I left off telling you guys
about our efforts to map large effect
[SPEAKER_02]: early bite resistance loci in two tomato
breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was telling you how we plan to use
this information to learn more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato early bite pathos system and to
develop new inbreds with enhanced disease
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I showed you that we found four early
bite loci of real interest here,
[SPEAKER_02]: two of which were predictive of the stem
population resistance, and that's EB1.1
[SPEAKER_02]: and EB9 here colored in green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two were predictive of resistance to
defoliation, and those were EB1.2 and EB5
[SPEAKER_02]: colored in purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of these four QTL, EB5 and EB9 had
statistically significant resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: effects across five breeding populations
over the course of three years,
[SPEAKER_02]: while EB1.2 was more inconsistently
detected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we've since used this information to
inform a genome-wide marker-assisted
[SPEAKER_02]: backcross scheme to rapidly pyramid these
early bite QTL into two elite tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: backgrounds from two separate market
classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the first of these releases,
CU191357, is a Northeast-adapted
[SPEAKER_02]: medium-sized fresh market slicing tomato,
and the other, CU201041, is a determinate
[SPEAKER_02]: Midwestern processing type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these tomatoes which carry additional
resistances to a host of other diseases
[SPEAKER_02]: are being thoroughly evaluated this summer
and are being released to third-party
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding programs through the Cornell
Vegetable Breeding Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, alongside these inbred releases,
we also wanted to provide reliable and
[SPEAKER_02]: background independent markers for these
early bite resistance loci.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the traditional way to do this would
be to iteratively find map, refining the
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence intervals until it was possible
to identify and validate candidate genes
[SPEAKER_02]: that would become the target of molecular
markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this kind of work is really time and
resource intensive, especially when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to quantitative disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a practical breeding perspective,
we don't really need to know the causal
[SPEAKER_02]: variants, and I would argue it's good
enough just to find the smallest extant
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance-bearing haplotype or the
smallest introgression from the ancestral
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you can design
markers that are specific to that
[SPEAKER_02]: haplotype, and these markers should be
capable of predicting resistance across
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding programs, regardless of the
recent ancestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my project partner and I are attempting
to do exactly that by sequencing
[SPEAKER_02]: landmark-resistant inbreds from more than
80 years of early bite resistance breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: and by applying the tools of population
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to do this successfully, our first
challenge was to dig through the available
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding records and to come up with a
hypothesized ancestral pathway for each of
[SPEAKER_02]: our resistance QTL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to take you now through one
such history, which begins with a tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: reader by the name of Dr. George B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Renard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dr. Renard was an avid bird watcher,
and in fact, he served on the board of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell Ornithology Lab, where he helped
them to build out the recordings of the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Caribbean bird songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Renard
worked at the Vegetable Breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there, he and C.F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrews worked out the first early bite
inoculation protocols, allowing them to
[SPEAKER_02]: screen tomato accessions for genetic
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he and Andrews found resistance in
several tomatoes, but one, an English
[SPEAKER_02]: forcing tomato by the name of Devon
Surprise, is described in their 1944
[SPEAKER_02]: publication as having particularly strong
resistance to early bite stem lesions,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a face of the disease also known
as cholera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, importantly, they also observed
inheritance ratios that suggested that
[SPEAKER_02]: this resistance was caused by a single
underlying locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dr. Renard eventually left the USDA
to become a tomato breeder for camels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story might have ended there were
it not for another important and more
[SPEAKER_02]: well-known early bite resistant tomato
called Campbell's 1943.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this tomato was described in a 1977
publication by Thomas Barksdale as having
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent early bite cholera resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Barksdale also writes that,
quote, Campbell's 1943 was kindly provided
[SPEAKER_02]: us by Dr. George B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Renard of the Campbell Institute for
Agricultural Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this suggests that Dr. Renard,
having previously discovered the early
[SPEAKER_02]: bite resistance in Devon Surprise,
then used this tomato to create Campbell's
[SPEAKER_02]: 1943.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from this point forward, recreating
the pedigree is much easier because Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Randy Gardner, now emeritus professor at
North Carolina State University,
[SPEAKER_02]: picked up Campbell's 1943 and used this as
a source of resistance for his 1980s
[SPEAKER_02]: release of NCEBr2, which had early bite
stem lesion resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then NCEBr2 was used in a subsequent
2008 release of NCELBr1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then NCELBr1 was used by the Cornell
Institute of Tomato Breeding Program as a
[SPEAKER_02]: source of resistance for CU151095,
which is in turn in the pedigree of our
[SPEAKER_02]: two newest tomato releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we repeat this process for other
sources of early bite resistance in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pedigree, I was able to put together this
greatly simplified hypothesized pedigree
[SPEAKER_02]: of early bite resistance in our tomatoes
that spans some 80 plus years of breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the next step is to obtain whole
genome sequences for all of these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of these sequences were
available from the NCBI Sequence Read
[SPEAKER_02]: Archive or from our collaborators at the
Ohio State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the remaining nine tomatoes,
though, we sequenced ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built libraries using the NexteraFlex
protocol and then ran them on a NextSeq500
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeds were then aligned to the Heinz 1706
reference genome, and this is the 4.0
[SPEAKER_02]: reference genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And SNPs were called with the GATK4
pipeline, and this yielded about 12x
[SPEAKER_02]: filtered coverage over the variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, if our hypothesized pedigree is
correct for the chromosome 9-QTL-EB9
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from Devon Surprise, then we should
be able to observe a shared haplotype near
[SPEAKER_02]: EB9 in Devon Surprise and in all of our
landmark early bite resistant inbreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this plot, which is based on the
output of the ABBA-BABA test, shows us
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is indeed the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this analysis looks for the evidence
of introgressions in triplet SNP contrast,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving a D statistic that can be used to
paint chromosomes by ancestry and also to
[SPEAKER_02]: visualize homologous haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we find is that in all of the
early bite resistant entries, they share a
[SPEAKER_02]: solid red block of SNPs near the EB9
locus, and this suggests a shared Devon
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise introgression.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, SNPs that are more consistent
with a Heinz 1706 ancestry are colored in
[SPEAKER_02]: blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, another way to find regions of high
sequence similarity is to window the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome and then to use a clustering
algorithm to intelligently group the
[SPEAKER_02]: resulting haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here you can see an example where
I've projected 30 tomatoes from four
[SPEAKER_02]: different clades into a two-dimensional
PCA space for a single genomic window near
[SPEAKER_02]: the EB9-QTL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I used the K-means algorithm to
cluster the samples and found that it
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly separated the early bite
resistant and susceptible large-fruited
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars from each other, from two cherry
tomato types, and from the wild species
[SPEAKER_02]: Solonum hapercites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this type of unsupervised clustering
analysis is really nice because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: computationally pretty trivial and because
we can improve our ability to distinguish
[SPEAKER_02]: among observable haplotypes as we add
additional sequences to our database.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once a sample in a window is
classified as a member of a group,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can then ask if that sample is in the
same or different group from some putative
[SPEAKER_02]: ancestral line of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can then color the areas that have the
same K-means cluster designation to
[SPEAKER_02]: visualize homologous haplotypes and even
introgressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here is one such plot of chromosome
9, inclusive of the eight resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: samples that I talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're blocked by this green resistant
bar at the top and then two random
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible samples from the pedigree I
described earlier at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genomic windows were colored if in any
window they were in the same cluster as
[SPEAKER_02]: Devon Surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resistant tomatoes are also sorted
according to their hypothesized ancestry
[SPEAKER_02]: with Devon Surprise, the putative donor,
followed by C1943, NCEBR2, NCEOBR1,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then our three most recent Cornell
releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really cool about a plot like
this is you can actually watch the
[SPEAKER_02]: haplotype from Devon Surprise decay over
time with phenotypic selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: going from a large introgression in
Campbell's 1943 to a relatively small one
[SPEAKER_02]: in the North Carolina tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here on the right, we've zoomed into a
95% confidence interval for the EB9 locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black ticks denote the confidence
interval boundaries and the most
[SPEAKER_02]: predictive stem marker at the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can clearly see that the smallest
contiguous Devon Surprise haplotype was
[SPEAKER_02]: present in the sample NCEOBR1A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gives us a new resistance
haplotype size that's about 33% smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: than before or about 1.2 megabase pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, these data strongly
suggest that our modern early blight stem
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance traces back directly to an
early 20th century tomato developed in
[SPEAKER_02]: Devon, England, which was then improved by
Dr. Raynard and through significant public
[SPEAKER_02]: sector breeding efforts spanning more than
40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't really have time today to
tell you the whole story for the other
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance loci here, but I did want to
show you that we can use the same methods
[SPEAKER_02]: to trace our early blight five resistance
locus to an unimproved tomato breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: line named Hawaii 7998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we were actually able to
shrink our interval size by more than 60%
[SPEAKER_02]: over our prior boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this demonstrates the power of this
approach to reduce QTL confidence
[SPEAKER_02]: intervals without ever having to do fine
mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we have some preliminary
success with this project, we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: scale this up to include wild species and
many more modern and heirloom tomatoes for
[SPEAKER_02]: which archive sequences already exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this should allow us to further trace
the history of our resistance loci back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the wild species donors and also to
determine whether there are other sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes sitting in the gene bank that
share this early blight resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: haplotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aim to identify snips that are specific
to this resistance haplotype to find
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent candidates for portable and
background independent molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we hope that this work will
help to reveal tomatoes with unique
[SPEAKER_02]: versions of the resistance haplotypes,
which could predict the presence of novel
[SPEAKER_02]: alleles conferring even stronger early
blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'd like to thank in
particular Martha Sutterman, who's my my
[SPEAKER_02]: project partner on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a this was largely funded from a
SIPS Schmidt Arnovec small grants program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank from the Missouri
Club, Kyle Laplante, who helped us to
[SPEAKER_02]: brainstorm these methods, these methods,
these methods for our project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank everyone in the Muschler
breeding program and in the Francis
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program at OSU, and also my
graduate committee members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I think I have a couple
more minutes here to take questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop sharing the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type if you have questions,
can take one minute or one minute for
[SPEAKER_00]: question running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any leads on the background of Devon
Surprise?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trail stops there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried looking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to find a company that sold
Devon Surprise, but they folded long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I can't identify who the breeder
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from this point forward,
we're going to try and find a wild species
[SPEAKER_02]: that that is the best supports
introgression and Devon Surprise and and
[SPEAKER_02]: make our best claim that that's the
ultimate source in this resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the historical approach, thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that on reducing the
haplotype sizes for finer mapping,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could be confounding the effects of
other potential causal QTLs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I think that reducing the haplotype
sizes for finer mapping?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I totally understand the
question there, but I don't think that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are confounding the effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could be leaving out other QTL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, I have already left out
several QTL that were of minor effect
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really wanted to focus on the largest
QTL of interest, largest effect QTL of
[SPEAKER_02]: interest, because that's really what the
breeding programs are most interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're trying to bring these into
their background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another question, what tool were
you using for haplotype?
[SPEAKER_02]: visualization?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used Python for creating the to do
the k-means clustering analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these plots are actually based on
they're actually just ggplot bar plots in
[SPEAKER_02]: which I've stripped out all of the
unnecessary background detail of the grids
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything and used facet wrap to to
stack all of the entries on top of each
[SPEAKER_02]: other so that we can do comparisons across
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that is one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have markers for QTL five and QTL
nine that seed companies could use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I mean, we currently have markers
that we are using in our own breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, the purpose for the motivating
factor for all of this work is to define
[SPEAKER_02]: markers that will be useful for all
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we currently have markers that
could be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not be polymorphic in all
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we hope that by the end of the day,
by the end of this work, they will be
[SPEAKER_02]: robust enough for any and all programs to
use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are no more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's thank Taylor for your nice work and
move on to the third speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
