[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Cedric Mason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with the New York State Soil Health
Initiative, also with David Wolf,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's a PI on the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working with policymakers,
researchers, nonprofits, all types of
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders in the state who are
interested in soil health to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve soil health all across the state
of New York, which is a little bit complex
[SPEAKER_02]: because New York has so many different
types of crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So soil health is important because it
supports food production for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the food that we eat comes from
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays a large role in protecting our
water resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has the potential to help us
mitigate climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the benefits of healthy soil,
especially with regard to food production,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we're going to focus on today,
is that healthy soil has high levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter, which help retain soil
moisture, retain water in the soil for
[SPEAKER_02]: crops to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also supplies nutrients for those
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feeds an intact soil microbiome,
which can include things like earthworms,
[SPEAKER_02]: insects, bacteria, and other microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And healthy soil can also function to
protect against crop diseases that could
[SPEAKER_02]: negatively impact these food crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, healthy soil provides a wide
range of pore sizes, which are conducive
[SPEAKER_02]: to both water holding capacity and also
rooting and drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in New York, a few things can go wrong
with maintaining our soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're driving these heavy tractors
over these soils, it's compressing the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, making it hard and difficult for
water and roots to move through that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what happens is we end up with some
erosion that can carry nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: sediment off the field into waterways,
which has other negative impacts off the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tilling can also result in the loss of
organic matter through oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make it difficult for some of these,
for the soil microbiome, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: earthworms are impacted by tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these fungal networks that can
transport nutrients to plants are also
[SPEAKER_02]: affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do we till to begin with?
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of it is to break up
compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that initial tillage creates
conditions that sometimes perpetuate the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compaction, if we treat that compaction
with tillage, we're burning off some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that organic matter, oxidizing it quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're feeding unhealthy microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking apart those soil aggregates
that provide the soil structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: provide the drainage that we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that soil gets re-compacted and
we need to plow again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to break this cycle and
find other ways to produce the crops that
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to eat and also maintain these
other benefits that soils are giving us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So specifically, we're looking at these
three practices, reduced tillage,
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops, and organic amendments,
which include compost, manure,
[SPEAKER_02]: and biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So reduced tillage has the benefits of
preserving the microbiome in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: preserves the macropores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not disturbing the soil as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also retaining out organic
matter, which stores carbon, provides
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients to the plants and also the
microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, off the farm,
when we start to look at the impacts of
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced tillage, we're saving on fuel
because we're not driving our tractors as
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saving on time and labor,
and we're saving wear and tear on our
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's other benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at cover crops, we're looking
at the rooting action of these plants can
[SPEAKER_02]: both break up hard pan, break up
compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows the soil to absorb more water
to transmit it to the water table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're adding organic matter from the plant
material that's returned to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're growing a legume, like in the
bottom left corner, this is a pea cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legumes can provide nitrogen in the soils
by absorbing it from the air and through
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really a wide variety of
applications and types of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on what crop we grow,
we can be providing forage on farm animals
[SPEAKER_02]: and also producing co-products,
like, for example, sunflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this climate, we have this long
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some challenges to getting
these crops established and getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits that they can provide,
especially over the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only about 10% of New York state crop land
is currently cover cropped, or at least it
[SPEAKER_02]: was in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that number is up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a challenge to get these cover
crops established and fit them in with
[SPEAKER_02]: rotations of the other crops that we're
trying to grow, because corn and soy
[SPEAKER_02]: usually come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're harvested in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, the growing season is
winding down, and it's really difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: get plants established at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some research looking at
interseeding, which involves planting
[SPEAKER_02]: these cover crops between the rows of corn
or soybeans to get them established
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we're looking at these
organic matter amendments, where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking, oftentimes, waste products,
crop waste or food waste, creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable compost or biochar from them or,
in the case of dairy farms, manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these can be applied in the soils and
adding organic matter back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this provides nutrients for the crops
as well as the microbes, which in turn
[SPEAKER_02]: help preserve the soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these also have the benefits of
reducing CO2 and methane that might come
[SPEAKER_02]: from improper decomposition of these
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to talk about today is
looking at some of the benefits,
[SPEAKER_02]: costs, and constraints that farmers see
when they're trying to implement these
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, because a lot of them are
coming from a place where they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: been using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't been using reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big challenge for them to
change the direction of the ship,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, they're running a
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of farms in this country are
businesses, so they're trying to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money and trying to pay their bills,
just like the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really looked closely in this study
at the financial picture these farmers are
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the tools that farmers can use
when they're trying to plan ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: evaluate potential changes in their
practices is that they can use this
[SPEAKER_02]: framework called the partial budget
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the partial budget analysis looks at
the expected change in their business that
[SPEAKER_02]: would come about when they use these
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could involve extra expenses that
they weren't seeing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could involve extra benefits that they
weren't seeing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here I've outlined these a bit for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see the green examples here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are examples that would positively
impact business.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, less fertilizer, less
pesticides, that's less money you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend on those inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we might be seeing greater yields,
and that can increase income.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we're looking at both the
positive and the negative aspects of these
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, we see the negative
aspects which might include extra cost for
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop seed or special planting
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might have to take some land out
of rotation to plant those cover crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: grow them for a year or so to get your
soil health going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at all these different
factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there have been some studies that
have used this partial budget analysis and
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at some specific farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of a case study that
was done by a company called Datu Research
[SPEAKER_02]: on a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a corn and soybean farm in the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here you can see they did a
five-year study, one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that there is an initial
cost in this case, kind of an investment,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after a couple of years,
that investment starts to pay off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can track the net benefit here and
see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit down the line, there could be
some real benefits to this, which is great
[SPEAKER_02]: because these practices also provide these
environmental benefits, these climate
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigation benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can make these, if these
practices can be profitable to the farmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be good for everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we wanted to capture
more than one farm in this state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to capture the whole state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to identify with this survey,
identify the specific costs that farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: were seeing and the specific benefits that
they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to encompass all of the types of
farms in the state, including different
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of experience, different crop
types, different systems, organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional, different farm sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually saw farms from, I think the
smallest was like 0.1 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to like 5,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really a broad survey that I'm
gonna present here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we also wanted to see how
improved soil health might help these
[SPEAKER_02]: farms, help farmers weather the storm,
if you will, by being able to sustain crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production in adverse years where there
might be flooding or there might be
[SPEAKER_02]: drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we conducted the survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We distributed paper copies of the survey,
which actually I have some leftovers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's curious to just check it out,
feel free to just stop by and I'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: you one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also used an online platform called
Qualtrics where respondents could access
[SPEAKER_02]: the survey online and just take it from
the comfort of their own home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was actually a really great way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of responses came in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at these three practices,
reduced tillage, cover crops, and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we asked farmers questions about their
practices and the benefits that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And statistically, we used the Chi-square
test to evaluate some of the associations
[SPEAKER_02]: between say a crop dropping practice and
the benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we received 182 respondents from all
over the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a map showing sort of the
geographic distribution of the responses
[SPEAKER_02]: that we received.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got really a good response rate in a
lot of the heavy agricultural areas here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot in western New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the response rate correlates pretty
well with the agricultural districts
[SPEAKER_02]: across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: 46 counties accounted for over 172,000
acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question on the survey was
really what constraints do you see to crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production on your farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how farmers answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the most frequent answer, actually they
could check off multiple answers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the most common answer was poor
drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second was compaction and third was
erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is interesting because these are
all three constraints that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: addressed with soil health practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see others here on the
right hand side too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were interested in determining
farmers who use these reduced tillage
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, what are they spending their
money on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the investments required?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also what are the benefits that
they're seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the results of the reduced
tillage pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 149 responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course this adds up to more than
149 because a lot of the farms were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing multiple crops with reduced
tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can see that the most popular crop
here is corn and soy for feed,
[SPEAKER_02]: followed by grains, oil seeds,
dry beans, the gray bar, alfalfa pasture
[SPEAKER_02]: hay, basically four, forage is a big one,
and vegetables are very common in the
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced tillage group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the number one cost that we're seeing
these farmers spend, that these farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: are seeing is specialized tillage
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: About half of them reported spending money
on that or at least encountering that
[SPEAKER_02]: obstacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then along with that specialized
planting equipment, a lot of times if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing reduced tillage you might be
trying to plant through a sod residue so
[SPEAKER_02]: you need a special grain planter that will
help you plant your crops through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're reducing tillage,
you're eliminating that mechanism of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: control and so you might be spending more
money on herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course there are additional
components down here, increased labor,
[SPEAKER_02]: lower yields, and other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are the three big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we did is we compared a couple
of different crop types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the yellow bar here represents farmers
who only grow corn and soybeans with
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green bar is farmers who only grow
vegetables with reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the gray here is the yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at specialized planting
equipment and we're seeing that overall
[SPEAKER_02]: around 50% of farmers are using this or
are requiring planting equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the vegetable growers really are not
reporting that as a cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that really reflects their
cropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a lot of them are organic and
they're planting, doing transplants by
[SPEAKER_02]: hand or they can use their existing
transplanter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not really seeing that as a big
obstacle for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another interesting one was you can see
that overall here increased labor was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really only maybe 13% of the farmers said,
okay, to do reduced tillage I need to put
[SPEAKER_02]: in more labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very clearly corn and soy growers are
not putting in more labor to reduce their
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's the opposite for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But vegetable growers are reporting this
expense at a much higher rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So almost 40% of the vegetable growers
doing reduced tillage are saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I gotta work a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm cultivating more often or I'm
hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm moving tarps around, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a pretty significant p-value
from our chi-squared test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're pretty sure there's a difference
there between the vegetables and the
[SPEAKER_02]: corn-soy growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at switching to the benefits that
these farmers are seeing from their
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced tillage practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less erosion and sedimentation repair is a
big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, if erosion is happening,
the soil's basically moving from the field
[SPEAKER_02]: into their drainage areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of farmers have to run their
tractor and kind of move that soil back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have to fix some rills and
gullies so that they can drive their
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment across the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a big benefit for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: 83% said that this was a benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in contrast to the increased
labor that we saw among the vegetables,
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable growers, 74% are saying,
yeah, I'm spending less on labor,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel, and equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not driving my tractor as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not driving that tractor myself as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then interestingly, over half said,
I'm also getting greater yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the benefits are real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also a lot of other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoided drainage investments, less
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're building their organic
matter so their soil's holding up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to irrigate as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a savings for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking again at the differences
between these crop types, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: greater yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was around about 52% overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe not quite as prevalent among the
corn and soy growers as it is to the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not quite sure why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an actually statistically highly
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be an artifact, but there
could be something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at lower fertilizer input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corn and soy growers, they're saying,
no, I still got to put the same amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But vegetable growers are seeing a benefit
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is fairly significant here,
0.05 p-value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, to wrap up this section
on reduced tail drainage, we asked about
[SPEAKER_02]: the profitability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the main picture here is that
very few farmers are saying this is
[SPEAKER_02]: decreasing my profitability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overwhelmingly, the majority are
finding this practice beneficial to their
[SPEAKER_02]: business, which is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to switch a little bit
and look at cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to recap again, the cover crops
are planted between crops to protect the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, provide feed to organic matter back
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the breakdown of the pool
that we saw responding to our cover crop
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 125 farms that we saw doing
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, again, is the corn and soy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then followed by vegetables,
surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vegetables are up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then grains and oilseeds, dry beans is
the gray bar here, number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the alfalfa pasture hay,
followed by some of these other minor
[SPEAKER_02]: crops here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So prevalent costs and decreases in
revenue from cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big one here is cover crop seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this indicates very few farmers
are actually growing their own cover crop
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, which isn't really surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a kind of a
complicated operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe some of them are doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crop termination is a big concern
among people growing these cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: because that cover crop goes to seed and
you can't kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seed is in your soil and it could
interfere with your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crop termination costs,
not surprising that's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different ways of terminating a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could let it winter kill, which is
just to let the cold kill the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some crops like radishes winter kill by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to worry about that too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could mow it, which might kill some
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could spray it and burn it down with
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also roll it, usually if
you're doing an organic system,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has its own charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the items that would
negatively affect a business that's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: these cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also interesting to look at some
of these additional ones too.
[SPEAKER_02]: People might be putting in more labor to
get these cover crops in or spending time
[SPEAKER_02]: learning about how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crops is a pretty tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The type of cover crop is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely some other
considerations in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't actually see any,
going back to this one, we didn't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: see many differences between the crop
types and the costs of these cover crop
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can switch right to the benefits of
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at these benefits, less erosion
is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: 83.9% are claiming less erosion from their
cover crops, which if you remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was one of the top three constraints
that farmers were also reporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crops are really a great tool to
combat this erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crops can actually result in greater
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're providing better drainage
and therefore your crop is growing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a little bit more nutrient
cycling going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be returning your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also lower fertilizer inputs can
result from these cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's from simply the organic
matter that's being built up and returned
[SPEAKER_02]: to the soil or it could be because they're
growing a legume cover crop that's fixing
[SPEAKER_02]: that nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one really has a whole lot of
other minor considerations here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easier or faster harvest could be a big
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get your equipment in there at
the right time because your soil has
[SPEAKER_02]: drained adequately, that could make your
life a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did see some more differences
between these crop types and these
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the greater cash crop yields,
we see overall right around 50% are
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not as many corn and soy and a whole
lot of vegetable growers are saying
[SPEAKER_02]: greater yields of cash crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decreased fertilizer inputs, similar
picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the vegetable growers really
responding to that item.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this could be due to maybe the
types of cover crops that vegetables are
[SPEAKER_02]: likely to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think corn and soy growers, they're
probably either taking land out of
[SPEAKER_02]: rotation for a year to grow something or
they're doing a grass like triticale or
[SPEAKER_02]: rye in the fall to get that over winter
cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not really providing their
nitrogen requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, there's also this
consideration of adding this high carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: mix back into your soil which can soak up
your other nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes sense that these corn and
soy growers are not reporting that as
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they are seeing this benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the cover crops as a source of
animal forage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So corn and soy is a big dairy feed crop,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these farmers have cows on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're feeding them every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They figure, hey, we can grow a cover crop
that protects the soil and also feeds the
[SPEAKER_02]: cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a double edged sword,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetable growers are not really seeing
that as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because they don't have animals
incorporated into their system as
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we asked the same question about the
profitability overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And got a similar response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, very few are saying this is not a
profitable practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: While a lot are saying, yeah, it's
profitable or has a neutral impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this comes down to the balance
of those positive and negative aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: that I talked about with the partial
budget analysis and kind of everything
[SPEAKER_02]: boiling down to is this investment paying
off?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the second big question that we
asked with the survey is how long does it
[SPEAKER_02]: take to see some of these benefits?
[SPEAKER_02]: So soils generally change pretty slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all heard the numbers about how
quickly soil can be eroded, but how long
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes for us to build topsoil,
to build that organic matter back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really interested in finding out
how long it takes for those farmers to see
[SPEAKER_02]: that extra income, that increased yield,
that reduced irrigation requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is we broke down all the
respondents in each of these pools into
[SPEAKER_02]: experience levels from one to five years,
five to 10 years, 10 to 20 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got a good representation across
all of those time periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used that to evaluate the point in
time at which these farmers are seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: these benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably the strongest
relationship that we saw, which
[SPEAKER_02]: interestingly is not necessarily related
to soil health, but it is related to
[SPEAKER_02]: income and benefits that these farmers
might be seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several different cost share
options out there that farmers can tap
[SPEAKER_02]: into to help cover the costs of doing
these practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's policies, conservation
policies that are trying to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: wildlife habitat and protect these water
resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're helping farmers do these
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, what we saw is that the
highest percentage of farmers accessing
[SPEAKER_02]: these programs are in the most experienced
group, whereas it's the opposite with the
[SPEAKER_02]: one to five year group, which is kind of
unfortunate because what we really want is
[SPEAKER_02]: to be helping these farmers get going and
helping them get these practices in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really why these policies exist
is to get things off the ground a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe this reflects the
difficulty that some farmers have
[SPEAKER_02]: navigating these policies and
understanding them and understanding how
[SPEAKER_02]: to tap into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully this will be useful for
policy makers in realizing that they need
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a better job of making these early
adopters aware of these programs and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting them involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a similar pattern with respect to
less erosion and sedimentation repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, again, reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not disturbing the soil as much,
not breaking up the soil pores,
[SPEAKER_02]: not oxidizing that organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore we're creating better
infiltration, better water infiltration,
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeing less erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing that that grows over time
almost to 100% in these two more
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also seeing that there is
frequently an immediate effect even within
[SPEAKER_02]: the one to five year group here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say that's over 60% of reduced
tillage practitioners are seeing an
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: On their erosion issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is using the chi-score test,
we saw that this was a significant
[SPEAKER_02]: association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking at the delay period for
benefits of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is a little bit of a
different mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: These cover crops are covering the soil,
holding it in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, we did not really see a
strong pattern here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the p-value is 0.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't really look like there's an
association.
[SPEAKER_02]: But initially, more than 75% are saying,
yeah, growing cover crops is reducing my
[SPEAKER_02]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's consistent for the next 20 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crops, this is showing cover
crops are immediately effective in
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another graph looking at these
different experience levels here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing greater yields among
these farmers who have been using cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could reflect the length of time
that it takes those cover crops to impact
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil health in tangible ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also we're seeing a bit of that even
among the early adopters here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a pretty decent p-value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think there's an association there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the converse of that last
slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was greater yields of cash crops
being more prevalent among the more
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we're seeing lower yields of cash
crops more prevalent among the early
[SPEAKER_02]: adopters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it quickly drops off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, none of these more experienced
practitioners were reporting reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only in the early adopter group
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those two slides together
really complete that picture of the
[SPEAKER_02]: initial investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's an initial cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But quickly, your yields should bounce
back and increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, the third question that we
looked at was the resilience that farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: were seeing to some extreme weather
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked them about the ability of
their cover crop practices, the reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage, and their soil amendment
practices to mitigate really heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: rainfall, flooding, and drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here, just as an example of what
can happen, heavy rainfall, maybe you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get a couple inches within an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can really pretty much submerge
your crop if your soil is not absorbing
[SPEAKER_02]: that precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other end of the spectrum,
we see here a farmer in September looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at his cornfield that hasn't gotten rain
in several months and is severely impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: by a drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of these situations could
potentially be mitigated with healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the responses that we got were
interesting in that a majority,
[SPEAKER_02]: over 60% of farmers who are using either
cover crops or reduced tillage are saying
[SPEAKER_02]: across the board, yeah, it's helping
prevent flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's helping reduce the impacts of
drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's helping reduce erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at amendments here,
which referred to mostly manure,
[SPEAKER_02]: compost, biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing really not as good
performance here, not surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are seeing a little bit of drought
resilience there from the amendments,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is probably a result of the
mulching effect and moisture retention
[SPEAKER_02]: that mulch can have on the surface,
and also the organic matter that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: adding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to wrap things up and mention
our website here, newyorksoilhealth.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have funding from CALS as well as ag
and markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we work with a wide variety of
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention David Wolf,
who's a big part of this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Ryan, Harold Van Ness are also PIs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron Risto is no longer with us,
but he worked with us on this quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also working with Johannes
Lehman, Thomas Bjorkman, Greg Peck,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Nina Bassam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, many others as well from
the NRCS and Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_02]: Extension, not to mention nonprofits,
policymakers, people like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank you for coming and try
to answer any questions that you might
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that was included.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have, actually, I should mention I do
have copies of the survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it's one piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can get kind of overwhelming when
you're approaching these farmers and
[SPEAKER_02]: asking them to spend 10 or 15 minutes
filling out a form that they don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really struggled to kind of
fit everything on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there were a lot of questions
that we would have liked to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're referring mostly to cover
crops, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, what would be the relevance of
that in terms of the economic picture?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you just saw some differences with
cover crops between corn and soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if that was just,
as I just noticed, if it was a winter
[SPEAKER_04]: cover crop, it had a chance to grow
longer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You make crops harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the challenge is there's so
many different types of farms out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've all got different types of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all planting a different cover
crop mix into a different cash crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that could be really useful if you
have a really targeted question and you
[SPEAKER_02]: really target specific, like you could
say, OK, say I want to compare the costs
[SPEAKER_02]: and benefits of farmers planting rye into,
or interseeding rye into corn and soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a good point, that this really
covers everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one of the good things about
it, is it gives us a big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the drawback is we can't really pick
out those details with this type of broad
[SPEAKER_02]: ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely all kinds of
opportunities for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we advertise the survey through
newsletters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which get sent into farmers' email
inboxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's very much self-selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did also go to a lot of conferences
and farmer meetings where there were maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 people in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all sort of took some time as part
of the meeting to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was a good thing in that
it encouraged people who otherwise
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have bothered to fill it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, one of the results was 125
of the 182 indicated that they used cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, which is totally disproportional to
the other numbers of cover crops that we
[SPEAKER_02]: think are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good for the survey because we got
a lot of responses relevant to these
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that really comes into play in
terms of those profitability pie charts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not necessarily
representative of the entire population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shannon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be an interesting way
to maybe touch on Peter's idea about
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into the nitty-gritty details of
the cover crops that are being used and
[SPEAKER_02]: the more specific methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harold?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cedric, I wondered about your category
corn and soy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of a category of farmers
here in New York that are corn and soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and are primarily grain growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are dairy farmers who grow
corn and typically, alfalfa or something
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you separate those out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with practices like minimum
pillage on a dairy farm, the needs are
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cover crops, a lot of the dairy farmers
need to plant cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the categories, I think if I understand
your question, you're asking, is silage
[SPEAKER_02]: corn considered the same crop as grain
corn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they in the same category?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the corn and soybean include silage
corn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually what we did is we used,
I think, eight different crop groups here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grains, oil, seed, dry beans, corn and
soybean for feed, tree fruit, berry crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were taken from the census
categories, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did specify corn and soybean for
feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that kind of brings up an
interesting point in that the language
[SPEAKER_02]: that you use in the survey is really
important because it's up to the farmer to
[SPEAKER_02]: read what's printed on the paper and try
to interpret that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely a little bit of
wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a farmer just glances over it
and puts it in another category or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess grain corn could be for feed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the ultimate place where it ends
up may be for feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the reason why I'm bringing it
up is it's for these dairy farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they often have a perennial crop in
there already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they are applying manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot easier for them to
establish a cover crop after corn silage
because they have a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them actually are required to do
it because of their CAFO plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And corn and soybean grower, that's a
grain grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grain might end up in an animal
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are initially selling it to an
elevator, specifically, and then it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, so if they're growing for
corn, corn for grains, then they have that
[SPEAKER_01]: long season, like you were saying,
which is really a much bigger challenge in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the corn have to dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe dry down a little bit before it
can... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, silage gets harvested around this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it has already been harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain might stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the challenges of doing a
survey like this is trying to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, but also not mix things up too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, berries on here could
be blueberries or it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess they're both perennials,
but strawberries are treated more as
[SPEAKER_02]: annuals than blueberries are per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things are kind of lumped together a
little bit in ways that might not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily make a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you kind of have to go with the
resources that you have and the space in
[SPEAKER_02]: the paper that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that could be a whole other
study is looking at just corn growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to pick apart the different cover
crop practices that are out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonathan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about your time domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of responses based upon,
you know, performance evaluation for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things, but the only time
domain you have is really sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiential.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the farmer's part, do you have anything
about when they established the whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: was conservation to whatever happens to be
the practices that they're putting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than experiential, timeline,
you actually have a practice timeline so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have some people to those types of
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I completely understand the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a grower who's got 20 years of
experience, but they've only established
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation to whatever happens to be for
the last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could be a difference between how
much experience do you have versus how
[SPEAKER_02]: long have you been doing this on your
farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way we worded the question,
I mean, I actually did think of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we worded the question,
because we wanted to capture the benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: that that person was seeing on the farm
that they were reporting for, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked them to report for their
primary farm, which we kind of defined a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit in the survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be conceivable that a farmer
might have sort of 30 years of experience
[SPEAKER_02]: growing cover crops, but recently
relocated to their farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was that was kind of a problem
that we considered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that we worded it was
approximately how many years have you used
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops on your farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we asked them to report the
information on the survey survey for their
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the response in that case would
have been one to five, five to 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really an experience of the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an experience of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I use that experience as you're
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a better word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think that's a better way of
getting the data anyway, because it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you more performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could it could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're sort of also asking the
farmer, are they reporting for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this this other farm that that
they do contract work with where they
[SPEAKER_02]: plant cover crops or it just kind of got a
little complicated when we started to dig
[SPEAKER_02]: into that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that I mean, that's that's that's
concern for sure is how do you how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: capture the data that you want?
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like there was a fairly high
prevalence of cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some respondents said, yeah,
I have cover crops in my board system,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a little bit of a great gray
area, I think, because it could be a cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be growing sure to kill as a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the forage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that was definitely a challenge
of the survey is like, how do we.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we include those?
[SPEAKER_02]: So so some farmers, I think, assumed,
oh, I'm just I'm just I've got some hay
[SPEAKER_02]: acreage and I'm just making hay and that's
a cover crop like I'm keeping the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and somebody else might be
saying, oh, I'm actually tilling and then
[SPEAKER_02]: planting alfalfa every five years or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And planting a cover crop in between or
something like that, so I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's there was kind of everything mixed
to that group.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I think we should thank Senator.

University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
