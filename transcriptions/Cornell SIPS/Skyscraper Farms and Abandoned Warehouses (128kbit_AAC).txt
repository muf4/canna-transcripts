[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Neil mentioned, I had retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a personal thought, modern
technology really messes up retirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can find me over the internet or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of questions get asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much the questions end up
falling into certain specific categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: like aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that's really a popular question
relates to urban farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, the old favorites in
urban farming, skyscraper farms or
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a real fascination with abandoned
warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first got these questions,
I began to think, some of this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it really make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to put some numbers with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to do today,
is go through just simple calculations,
[SPEAKER_00]: simple ways that a technical person should
look at some of these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of it, make up your own
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a specific agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, trying to put numbers,
try to put some logic to the question of,
[SPEAKER_00]: is urban farming in this kind of a system
worthwhile?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really characterizes these
systems is the dependence on artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental light, non-sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about urban plant
factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a generic term for this,
very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they high in the sky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they pie in the sky?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll let you decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really talking about skyscraper
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these mentioned on the internet,
up to 60 stories tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various crops grown in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more ambitious people try to grow
trees and cows, things like that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: skyscraper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one, abandoned warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love to fill abandoned warehouses
with plants, because what else are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do with an abandoned warehouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: One might guess tear it down and start
over, but they want to use it over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an emperor wearing new clothes or
not is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a lot of proposals,
a lot of designs have been developed to
[SPEAKER_00]: show, to create vertical farm facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it strikes me, that must be enormous
fun to be an architect.
[SPEAKER_00]: More fun than any other profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can invent these things that
don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can let your imagination flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the ideas on the roof,
but also in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all architectural drawings,
they're not for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a big skyscraper like this,
or one like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, you can't read the icons,
but they talk about what can be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cherries, peaches, grapes,
fodder.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of things that propose to grow
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the plantagon in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a skyscraper they're trying to sell
to various cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very tall, 60 story tall skyscraper
with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is also a plantagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a circular greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are put in one end,
and there's a ramp that circles up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant goes up, or else comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's put on as seeds on one end,
harvested crop on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this interesting is the
Janendaga Nation has, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased a significant portion of their
investment money, put a lot into this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular idea, to sell these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more imaginative designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like something like this,
it's stacked pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is specifically designed to be a
stacked pebble greenhouse, if you like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is called the dragonfly for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being very promoted for placement of
one of these on railways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is on Roosevelt Island in New
York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's where Cornell is a tech
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any reason for it,
but coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the most imaginative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go through a number of things
and talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some background on vertical farm concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality check on the crops that can be
grown, because the crops that can be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: have been proposed, as I said,
for all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the primary motivations for
some of the enthusiasts is to return
[SPEAKER_00]: farmland to the primordial state.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get rid of all farmland and grow all of
our crops in vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost comparison, related to photosynthetic
lighting in a vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it cost you to run 100%
lights versus using the sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the one that's the untold
story, really, and nobody seems to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the how large is the carbon
footprint?
[SPEAKER_00]: These concepts are motivated by the desire
to do away with food miles, the large
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon footprint associated with food
miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's grow the plants locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow them in an abandoned warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Promise some more efficient lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about LEDs a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, well, I don't worry about
electricity because I'm going to put in PV
[SPEAKER_00]: panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at that critically and see if
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ways to add light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flat mirrors, concentrating mirrors,
light pipes, fiber optics, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: high tech ways of reflecting, carrying,
transmitting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to be a little bit
positive and end on the idea that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some places where this might make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it all goes well, questions and
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice I don't say answers,
just questions and discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the current book that you may have
heard about is the vertical farm book by
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixon Despomier from Columbia University,
who's not a greenhouse person at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a number of quotes,
several quotes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I agree with and some I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is we know how to proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can apply hydroponic and aeroponic
farming methodologies to a multi-story
[SPEAKER_00]: building and create the world's first
vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure we know how to proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's a little bit irritating is that
the numbers he uses to promote his system
[SPEAKER_00]: are our own numbers applied
inappropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I do agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be cheap to build, modular,
durable, easily maintained, safe to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate, independent of economic subsidies
and outside support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he admits that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also says no ecosystem can exceed
the limits of biomass production,
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly limited by the amount of incoming
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing plants in a building,
heat is one thing, but light is the really
[SPEAKER_00]: important first part to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things I agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if it really is true in his
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of skepticism about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the only one in the world
skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing plants in these different
facilities, they doubt the practicality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this slide, this picture,
everybody know what this plant is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bibb lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says bibb lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago, I got an email from,
he was from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had an abandoned warehouse that he
converted to growing lettuce, put some
[SPEAKER_00]: skylights in the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was his crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me, what nutritional factor
is at play here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light, obviously light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the kind of thing that people
don't make any real connection to is the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light that a plant needs because
the plant is so linear with respect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and the eye is so nonlinear that you
can see very well in a low light that will
[SPEAKER_00]: plant barely at the compensation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant at a compensation point gets
enough light that you can see very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tackling some of the doubts one at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greens, herbs, possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vine crops, small fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit, tree crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next level of proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, corn, soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next level to return land to its
primordial state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the claim that wheat is
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick that crop at random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the economic viability of
CEA wheat production as a metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world record for outdoor wheat
production as one comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done in 2010 in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: 233 bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil said I grew up on a farm in Newfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our yield was about 10% of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That much per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the record outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, the most I've seen is work that's
been done by Bruce Bugby and Frank
[SPEAKER_00]: Salisbury, Utah State, looking at wheat
production for NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to push the limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far can they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light can they give it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much growth can they get?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was looking at wheat with three
tillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary, secondary, tertiary tillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the yield from each one as a
function of daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about daily light integral
as you know in moles per square meter per
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or talk about light in general as
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding these three together you get a line
that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield as a function of daily light
integral, it goes up to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wheat is still increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's 150 moles per square meter per
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good feeling for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum that I could find ever for
Ithaca was 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 14 years of Ithaca's weather data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the daily moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the day of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are measured data from the
Cornell weather station for 14 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 83 to 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on this, this bounding
curve is outside the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the little dots are individual
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick flick, 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good number to pick sort of in
the middle of the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it is achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line is 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became my guess as a place to make
an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing as well as we'll do in Ithaca
just about any day of the year better than
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting April 20th, ending August 8th is
when you pass that maximum possible at 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's assume we will grow crops within
this greenhouse at 55 moles per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter per day, daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I tended to make, going to present a
number of things in these sort of flow
[SPEAKER_00]: charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you like flow charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been told that it's easier to understand
than a series of equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at two possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record field production, the 1.567,
et cetera, yearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: High intensity growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could do four crops a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce could do four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dwarf wheat too, a very high
intensity production in a dwarf wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two kilograms per square meter per harvest
at 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we have four harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four harvests with the high intensity
growth room get far more than the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take four harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll assume we can harvest four times a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight kilograms per square meter per year,
or 1.64 pounds per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best I thought we could
probably do with wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the value of wheat?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the year old data,
but I looked yesterday and the wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: prices have stayed very similar,
very consistent over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.5 cents a pound is the world wheat
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that, 12.5 cents a pound, 1.64 pounds
per square foot per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 cents per square foot per year is the
income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we replace outdoor agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's a commodity, you must have
something more valuable than any
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corn, wheat, et cetera are not
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot replace outdoor agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as answers come up if you look at
wheat, corn, soybeans, any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one perspective is how much
income you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other perspective is the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cost of the electricity to run
this facility to grow the wheat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's assume we have good efficient
lighting, high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: good LEDs, yearly income 20 cents per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the electricity bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than saying what's the electricity
bill, I wanted to ask the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the cost of the electricity to bake
one loaf of bread, to grow the wheat for
[SPEAKER_00]: one loaf of bread?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bake some bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things I learned doing this,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never baked bread, never ever baked bread
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: One kilogram of wheat, 1.3 liters of
kernels, 2.6 liters of flour, because
[SPEAKER_00]: flour makes a lot of air space.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.7 loaves of bread out of one kilogram of
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's taking this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 55 moles per square meter times 365
days, 20,000 moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell data for high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a test of eight different high
pressure sodium lamps some years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and generally got the number that we get
four moles of light from a luminaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four moles for every kilowatt hour that
went into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these were 400 watt lights,
600 would be slightly better, 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly better, but you're not going to
get above four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three seems to characterize a lot of
the lighting, and it characterizes LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 6,600, 6,700 kilowatt hours per
square meter per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's assume the electricity is 10 cents a
kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: $687 of cost per square meter per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know one kilogram produces 3.7 loaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bake 29.6 loaves out of this square
meter, and we pay electric bill of $23 a
[SPEAKER_00]: loaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tended to pick generous assumptions,
and even with the generous assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, at $23 a loaf, I got rather
concerned, I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So commodities won't pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at a non-commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at, in this case, lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use the model as being the
greenhouse that Challenge Industries runs
[SPEAKER_00]: out by NYSEG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the CEA greenhouse from several years
ago that was given to Challenge by
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The productivity, at the time it was
built, we were planning on 1,245 heads per
[SPEAKER_00]: day from the system, total heads per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked with the assistant manager a
couple of weeks ago, and he said he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: counting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 1,240.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a bad assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple get thrown out, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that much, and these are 150 to
160 gram heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the extra cost of total closure?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if we totally close it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means 100% artificial light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people object to the concept of
artificial light, because all light is
[SPEAKER_00]: real, but it's a term that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the daily light integral that's
imposed on the lettuce to prevent tip burn
[SPEAKER_00]: and to maximize growth, optimize growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% supplemental light or 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why 30%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, based on the data that we have,
over a year that greenhouse received 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: of its light from the sun, and even in
Ithaca, 30% from electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the three moles per kilowatt hour
of the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the word efficacy rather than
efficiency, because the units are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same top and bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: 689 kilowatt hours per square meter per
year with the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2068 with the closed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Productivity as given before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get .91 kilowatt hours per head from
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.72 from the plant factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly to more than almost three times
as much electricity goes into the crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant factory as it goes into a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the hydroponic production of lettuce
challenges getting by, and some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting by, but it's not highly
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no 30%, 40% return on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tripling the kilowatt hours per head
at 10 or whatever cents per head or
[SPEAKER_00]: kilowatt hour could be a problem
economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, it all depends on the
market price.
[SPEAKER_00]: This always comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enthusiasts will say that it depends on
the market price, and they have a special
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told this so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a special contract with the
supermarkets that I'm going to get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the local market will support a higher
price, because it's people who like to
[SPEAKER_00]: support locally grown food if there's a
place like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people pay a little extra for the
challenged lettuce because they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the local production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it has higher quality and therefore
achieves a higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the arguments that always come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question that these contentions
are probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some other factors outside of
the energy input that are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at two different little
asides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go back to the important
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've shown so far has just been
for lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could imagine stacked trays and a
closed room being lit 20, 24 hours a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of heat, no matter whether
they're LEDs or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ventilate, you can't use CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to ventilate a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get rid of that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the greenhouse, you have the fans,
and you have heat loss through the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the energy balance is a little
different in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to which, the air movement
becomes a real problem when things are
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked one on top of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's also interesting in these pictures
that advertise the plant factories always
[SPEAKER_00]: show fluorescent lights, because it's a
way to stack them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the least efficient way of lighting
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Incandescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the second?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second least efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left shows LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separate question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate's better than Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the supplemental light need by
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the Ithaca greenhouse, the Finger
Lakes Fresh Greenhouse, gets 30% of its
[SPEAKER_00]: light from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go not too far away, go to
Hartford, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Islip, Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get quite a bit improvement on the
light environment if we go away from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca, which is probably not a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production in a greenhouse can be lowered
by adding CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the outputs of the CAA program has
been a couple of algorithms for
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling light.
[SPEAKER_00]: One controls the light to a daily integral
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is to control the light and
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the CO2 does, it makes the
natural light more efficient, so you need
[SPEAKER_00]: less supplemental light, and then it makes
the supplemental light more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the simulations showed 49% savings on
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a computer simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we set up an experiment, and Tim
Shelford ran the data in the
[SPEAKER_00]: post-greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, green greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never learn that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much agreed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that greenhouse is much darker than
the 70% transmissive greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the numbers aren't quite the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the conclusion was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reduce the yearly lighting by about
a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you cannot do that in a closed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you add CO2, you're not reducing
the amount of, you're not making outside
[SPEAKER_00]: light more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're relying entirely on the
supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it saves, and it saves maybe 30%
at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a savings there, but not quite
the same as a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where it's located, because
plant factory doesn't matter where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these bring the salad crop carbon
footprints very close to what is imposed
[SPEAKER_00]: by importing the crop from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greenhouse can be also very
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we talked about carbon
footprint, ask what is the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint associated with creating
supplemental light to grow food crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the carbon footprint?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll measure the carbon footprint or
express it in the mass or volume of CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: that's given off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about CO2 in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a lot of lights in a
greenhouse, where's the CO2 coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go down to the power plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generating the electricity and
they are emitting the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generally overlooked point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is data for power plant
production in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour
for coal, for gas, for the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at the others,
which of course don't burn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take these numbers,
which are still valid, I just looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the site in January and the numbers are
still valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mean use of these fuel forms,
32% of our electricity over the country
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from coal, 32% from natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest from these other forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them all together on average and you
get it with 460 grams per kilowatt hour or
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.46 grams or roughly a pound of CO2 per
kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every kilowatt hour you burn puts a pound
of CO2 into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a 100 watt lamp for 10 hours,
you put a pound of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it mean in a practical sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of these graphs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take let's say the daily
light integral of 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers change a bit depending on the
daily light integral that you impose.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6205 moles per square meter per day,
productivity 760 per square meter per
[SPEAKER_00]: year, head weight five ounces,
five to six ounces, 150, 160 grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of three again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three moles going into 6205.
[SPEAKER_00]: 268 kilowatt hours to grow 118 kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 and a half kilowatt hours per kilogram
divide 118 into 2068 at 0.47 kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of
lettuce or eight pounds of CO2 per pound
[SPEAKER_00]: of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how to put some physical meaning into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way, I looked at data and it's as of
January 2014, the average passenger car in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: emits 5100 kilograms of CO2 per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have eight pounds a kilogram,
eight kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 5100 kilograms from one car is
equivalent to CO2 emitted to grow 5100
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by eight, 636 kilograms of
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 4,000 heads of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over three days production from the
challenge greenhouse give you the same CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: as driving a car for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go back to the power plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not counting the extra energy for
refrigeration, air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling, all of those things in a plant
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've seen up down to this point,
eight pounds of CO2 per pound of lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: or kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight pounds of CO2 per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three heads of lettuce per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.67 pounds of CO2 per head of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density of CO2 is 0.124 pounds per cubic
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21.6 cubic feet of CO2 per head of
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.48 gallons per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply 7.48 times 21.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every head of lettuce that's grown 100%
light creates CO2 at the power plant
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to 355 gallon drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can all kind of visualize a 55
gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of them get filled to grow one head
of lettuce in a totally enclosed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a greenhouse 30% from the sun,
from the light, 70% from the sun is down
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2.42 kilograms compared to 8.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All supplemental light is 8 to 1 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.4 pounds in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not wonderful, but three and a third times
more CO2 from the plant factory than from
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then comes the question, is this
sustainable agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold as a sustainable agriculture
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You decide if it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three 55 gallon drums for one head of
lettuce.
Sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it disregards the additional carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I work with Norm Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Norm Scott, some of you may know Norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great enthusiast about
self-contained cities, self-supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at the number for lettuce
and he said, well, that's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went from lettuce to tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the same calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whereas lettuce had 8 to 1 ratio,
tomatoes had an 18 to 1 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just have to think about
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stems and leaves and things that
you don't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, stems and leaves and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato production cannot be stacked as
another consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building has to be a lot taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a lot more volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomatoes have a higher dry mass
content so that you're putting more light
[SPEAKER_00]: into a single tomato, into a single pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why worry about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiation of this was related to the
concept of food miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this compare to transported
lettuce?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a website, a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: David de Villiers spent many hours working
on an energy study for NYSERDA looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy cost of importing versus
locally grown for six different crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: some greenhouse, some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The report is on the website if anybody
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want this, send me an email and I
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send you the actual URL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email, which reminds me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My initials are LDA, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: L stands for new, and D stands for devil's
advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's David's data all imports to
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is transported in various ways,
0.7 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: From truck exhaust, from various other
sources of transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average food miles for lettuce in New
York is 29.63, and that's where people
[SPEAKER_00]: really worry, and they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant factory, 8.05 compared to 0.7 for
lighting only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transport is for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0.8 for lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant factory adding CO2, saving a third,
5.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA and Ithaca using LACI as our acronym
for our light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This algorithm and program, 2.42.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA and Long Island with control,
1.21.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA and Ithaca with CO2 control,
1.23.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA and Long Island with CO2 control,
0.62.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this step by step by step change in
production, we can get the CO2 for
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting to be the same as the CO2 for
imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot lower, but at least the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be certain benefits,
of course, for local production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a solution to the light
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not run over, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, people have talked about different
ways of improving the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, concentrating, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important question, do we violate
laws of physics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prefer not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've made a career out of trying
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at electrically generated light
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before anybody asks, this one is on
the final exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just briefly, what this says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planck's law, we've heard about Planck's
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome of Planck's law is theoretical
maximum efficiency, which can be expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneously or integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things to worry about with thermal
losses, electrical losses, optical losses,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go from theoretical maximum efficiency
to real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is a wall plug efficiency of
perhaps 20% or 25%, the same as HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philips provides data for their LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efficiency goes over a range,
because it depends on which bin they take
[SPEAKER_00]: their LED out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they test them long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we end up with a real world efficiency
near three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use three all the way along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to not believe it,
I can send you this slide, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: check my numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED technologies are improving,
and their costs are shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't believe the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprise?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen ads for LED systems for plant
lighting that suggested a degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency somewhere in the range of 150%
to 175%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six times as good as an HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six times as efficient as an HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more not justified by data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the comparisons are against
fluorescence or incandescent to make
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends whether you're buying or selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And HID luminaires and T5 fluorescence are
also much more efficient than
[SPEAKER_00]: incandescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And efficiency is very similar to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't do a whole lot to make the
lighting more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a little bit, and it will be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enormous change.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about photovoltaics?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the argument that always comes
back, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it takes a lot of
electricity, but I'm going to put up PV
[SPEAKER_00]: panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look first at the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at a greenhouse, a modern
greenhouse, 100 units of outside light,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% transmissive, we get 70 units of solar
light through the greenhouse to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's effectively a 70% efficient
transmitter of outdoor light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a PV system, now we generate
electricity from the photovoltaic panels,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it into the greenhouse, run lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean by generating
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panels are typically 15% to 18% efficient
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 11 derating factors that are
always applied when you put a panel into a
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose something.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you lose 28% standard default
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Availability and need may be asynchronous.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a bright sunny day when you can
generate electricity, you don't need it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloudiness is frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffuse solar is weaker, but it can be
used, but it is weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jumping through this, we don't worry about
the steps anymore, but looking at using
[SPEAKER_00]: the panel at 18% efficiency by the
standard 28% loss, I think at 223 kilowatt
[SPEAKER_00]: hours per square meter per year predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've compared that to real data,
and it's a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficiency of three, efficacy of three,
panels provide 669 moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 6205 for the 17 moles per square
meter per day daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that 669 divided by 62.5,
10.8% of the need for one square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invert that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing 10% of the need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need much more area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, 9.3 times as much as lighted
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: One acre of greenhouse lighted,
9.3 acres of panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way does that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in this world, not in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times the growing area, asynchronous
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: By asynchronous, of course, you produce
electricity when there's the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it in the greenhouse or in
the whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it back to the power company and say,
oh, I'll use the grid as storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, if you send things back to
the power company, you don't get the full
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get only what they would have paid to
replace that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another small nuance that I think is
important about this, using renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: energies to do things that are foolish,
is that you are depriving someone else of
[SPEAKER_00]: the excess to that renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that someone else does not have
another source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go to a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I have a plant factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wasting the energy, taking it away
from someone else who could use it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have photovoltaic panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a choice between a greenhouse
or a plant factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, I'm going to take a plant
factory and I'm going to use the renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to use your grid energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take the greenhouse instead,
we now have renewable energy that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: being wasted in my plant factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm taking it away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall system has not improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flat mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say we're going to do mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it violate the law of physics?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can't direct things with flat
mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffuse radiation is diffusely reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't direct it into the plant factory
using flat mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't use flat mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use concentrating mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This palm year says this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two kinds of concentrating mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parabolic shape for a reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflects the incoming light to a line,
if it's a 2D parabola.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a focal point in a pipe where it
carries the heat away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to a surface at the bottom where it
absorbs the heat and carries it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way or another, the light is reflected
down and collected into a small area
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not get shown back over to
someplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't bounce it over somewhere else
and concentrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We concentrate it into a small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we going to do with all this
heat in the middle of the collector?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can, of course, focus if you want
to build this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a power tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happens to be in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these is a little flat plate
reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are controlled by a computer to
reflect the sunlight into a tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it collects the heat, generate
electricity, do that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This won't be parts of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another issue, solar angles in the summer
are very different from winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of these, you put the flat side of
the greenhouse, this tower facing south,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then think about what happens if I
pretend I'm facing south.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, but pretend I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the wintertime, the sun rises over
here, goes up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming into the south, with glazings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall and spring, it's coming over here and
going overhead like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't shine on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have access to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime, sun rises in the
northeast, comes up high and goes up back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the north.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't shine into the building very
much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using solar light into a tall building
like this, you can't move the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you could put this building onto a
rotating platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflectivity of surfaces, once you get
past about 55 degrees, the reflectivity
[SPEAKER_00]: begins to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that sun is the middle of the day in
the summertime, 76 degrees above the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon in Ithaca in solar noon on the
first day of summer, that angle is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 56 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be bounced down to the
ground, most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the angle of incidence of
south, look at the angle that the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in to a south-facing surface,
21st of March, south-facing surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: only a few days will it be less than 55,
a few times and latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 21st of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: April, we're down to the point where
almost no time during the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have sun coming into that
south-facing surface effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: May, none.
[SPEAKER_00]: June, none, which means July, August,
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same symmetric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this problem of reflectivity in
the solar angles shining into a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: if the greenhouse is a vertical farm,
skyscraper farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A slightly more positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the concept of peri-urban
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think back, go back a few
thousand years, not even I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back a few thousand years, there were
villages surrounded by farms who fed the
[SPEAKER_00]: village.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't imported long ways,
but they weren't in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: village either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were surrounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one concept that might apply into
this question of getting local food
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of advantages, the peri-urban
area is between the city and the
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding countryside, but you have
advantages, less expensive land,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower construction costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building greenhouses instead of
skyscrapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have natural gas, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have perhaps three-phase
power, perhaps municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have services there, and you have
highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on a big truck, send it into the
produce market.
[SPEAKER_00]: One-shot transport rather than everybody
coming in with their little panel trucks
[SPEAKER_00]: from all over the city to your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Located away from air pollution plumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hard point to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air pollution does affect plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does affect considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could give you several papers that show
city air suppresses the growth of lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: by about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scenarios where this might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that might be possible, we've had some
contact with some Oman, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: who look at this as a source of food
because everything is being imported now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but water is more valuable than
electricity to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a system like this with
refrigeration, the refrigeration system
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the condensate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull the evapotranspiration back out
of the water and you save energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save water, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the world is entirely on renewable
energy, there's no carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not happen right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solely on fission energy, no carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solely on fusion energy, no carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there possible recapture benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of these scenarios are
very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody got money put into fusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be small scale applications,
of course, where total closure would work
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's different from talking about
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perhaps part of a greenhouse
operation, perhaps not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works that's been done for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO research where you don't want transfer
of genetic information back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: across the structural wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairbanks, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could work.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Pole Research Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good emotional outlet sort of
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go in and relax and it feels like
it's back home again for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I conclude, is the emperor wearing any
new clothes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do numbers lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy to go through the numbers if
anybody wants to really double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we violate the laws of physics more
than a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
