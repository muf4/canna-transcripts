[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of followed this talk,
Finding a Passion for Petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think petunias are sometimes,
they're one of those, they're ubiquitous,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really popular in garden centers
in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a very easy plant for people
to hate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sticky, they've got lots of
different colors to them, but they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, for a plant nerd, they're kind of
basic, right, if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll kind of get into that,
but I wanted to kind of share,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what are we going to talk about
today is, first, some origin stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies, so now we are mic'd up,
so Stephanie Winehouse, hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk first about some origin
stories, why I feel so passionately about
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, and then why I found a passion
for petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do some overview and talking about
the horticulture industry as a whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ornamental side, of horticulture
and what it looks like today, who is Doom
[SPEAKER_00]: and Orange, what is the company,
what are we doing, and then also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dive into some new technologies that are
happening within the horticulture industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're really super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, I'll kind of
share some ways that you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: choose your own adventure, or grow your
own adventure, as I like to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and talking about that there are future
career paths in horticulture or outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing in a greenhouse or going for
a botanical garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super, like, super excited to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a dream come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, pinch myself, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I'm also one of those types of
people that if you have questions or
[SPEAKER_00]: comments or want to heckle me in the
middle of the seminar, just, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: go right at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how did it all start?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not from a plant family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't come from a grower family,
a background in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from two parents who are artists,
one who grew up in Manhattan, the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one who grew up living afternoons and
weekends at the Cleveland Institute of
[SPEAKER_00]: Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my dad's side of the family,
from a farm in southern Vermont,
[SPEAKER_00]: southern New Hampshire, where they grow
organically grown beef cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I first found my passion for
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stewardship of just the land in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were also kind of hipsters in
the sense, or kind of outward thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: people, growing vegetables in 1980s out in
the front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, Nellie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy concept.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's watermelon and lettuce, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also that kid who at five,
actually, no, at six, I recognize living
[SPEAKER_00]: in DeWitt, just a suburb of Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the fact that when I'd go on
walks around Onondaga Lake, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: polluted, and I'd see people's trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made my own Earth Day campaign in
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't throw your trash,
because that's not really nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really started at the age of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me later on at the age of 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Disney World for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who have been there
or may not have been there, Epcot is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the parks in Florida, and they have a
civilian or space, it's called Living with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a ride there, where you get
into a boat, and you learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you learn about aquaculture and
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the late 90s, early 2000s,
that I turned to my mother, and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I want to do with the rest of
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a passion for hydroponics,
a passion for lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how I came to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to originally work for either a
seed company or for Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then learned very swiftly,
Monsanto is not a great place to work at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in those early days, I kind of thought
that horticulture was really just
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does gardening entail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gardening, in my mind, in the early
2000s, as an 18-year-old, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have somebody who's making those
plants that you ultimately will go to
[SPEAKER_00]: either an independent garden center,
or you'll go to Home Depot, or Lowe's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll buy those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll bring them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, to me, was my scope of what
horticulture really could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cornell opened my eyes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at Cornell in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a perspective, a lot of the
buildings that are here now didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunter Rawlings, Rakan, he was a great
president.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was our president at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men's hockey was in the frozen four twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woohoo, go line of faithful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Court and News were two brand new
residence halls that are open for the
[SPEAKER_00]: second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have now been renamed to Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But North Campus was for freshmen only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had things like Facebook,
iPhones, Snapchat, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those things existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back when, actually, Kanye West was a
good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Snoop Dogg was still really a good
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both performed at Slotay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond having lots of fun,
we did a lot of great science things here
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an intern with Bill's group at the
Bluegrass Lane, the horticulture test
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens there, where we had different
breeders would send us their trial plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or trial material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of my first,
I guess, foot into what the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: industry could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opened my eyes to that there are more
plants than just petunias or geraniums
[SPEAKER_00]: that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are breeders, there are
companies that actually make new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they use help from universities
and from interns like us to evaluate those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, to see how well they do in our
landscape, how well do they do in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on trips to going to St. Lucas
Greenhouses in New Jersey that opened my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes further into what is it like to own
and to work and to operate at a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale production greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some sciencey things, some of my
favorite pictures of soil science lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as my time as a weed scientist
identifying weeds in weed trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through Cornell, my whole vision of the
horticulture industry kind of broadened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have additional fields here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody who's actually creating
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now are calling the home gardener
actually consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got super jazzed by things like the
Seeley Conference, where we would bring
[SPEAKER_00]: people from the industry to come and talk
to us about what's happening in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are different trends?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some pain points for the whole
entire industry as a whole?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get more people to buy more
plants and to live a life with plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really found that that was where my
passion was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to work for a chemical
company, didn't want to be shilling my
[SPEAKER_00]: life working for academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to somehow get more plants
into the hands of people and to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: world a more beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And university as an extension,
obviously, was another part of that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was through visits to this really
great trade show called the Ohio Short
[SPEAKER_00]: Course at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now operated and is called Cultivate
at American Hort, the industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: association for horticulture, where I got
a complete immersion into all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different fields that you could really
have here in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond just those arrows that we had
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have things like automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have engineers that are involved in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have marketing companies that make tags
and house all that kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So truly, the horticulture industry is
made up of a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those propagation farms that
actually bring the plants to life and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them to the garden centers or to the
growers that are growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fields of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fields of brokerage sales,
the concept that how do these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we selling them across the United
States as well as into Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering and automation IT is really
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: University and extension is also still a
really integral role to the success of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after Cornell, I was recruited out and
I worked for a company called Peachtree
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm, where they were a small grower just
outside of the north of Philadelphia,
[SPEAKER_00]: all organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I was their sales and marketing
director.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had a kid at that time who was able
to bring my seven-week-old daughter to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she grew up living a life with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is now 10 and probably knows and can
identify lavender better than anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, so what does sales and
marketing director really mean or manager
[SPEAKER_00]: really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of a Jill of all trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was writing invoices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was booking sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was partnering with Botanical Gardens
because we were plant geeks at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a lot of broker relations,
so working with the different sales
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to kind of get our products out
into the marketplace to get them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: different growers so that we could buy and
sell more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that time, I also was a part
of the launch and product launch and
[SPEAKER_00]: patenting of a plant called Lavender
Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's ever heard of Lavender Phenomenal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more than I thought, more than just
Bill and the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender Phenomenal, it's a, we found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sport of lavender that we were
propagating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is one of the top selling now
cultivars of lavender on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has surpassed Grosso, Munstead,
and Hidcote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is far superior in its garden
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really phenomenal from its
uniform architecture from plant to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to say it was like little soldiers
all in a row when you were planting it out
[SPEAKER_00]: at Lavender Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wild time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I decided I needed to come
back home to central New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked at Dickman Farms Garden
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an independent garden center just
north of here in Auburn, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also wholesale growers,
one of the biggest wholesale growers here
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran the retail arm of that company
for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought up the profits of the company
from 2% to 8%, which is pretty great,
[SPEAKER_00]: through skew rationalization, really
trying to hyper focus what our products we
[SPEAKER_00]: were offering to our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a wild ride and crazy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as I loved being able to get
plants into the hands of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: through that by retail, I hated
babysitting high schoolers, babysitting
[SPEAKER_00]: adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that New York was pretty high
on the list of different things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had to make sure that what our staff
members were doing during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still the craziest time ever, and I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was ready to get back to what I
loved at Peas Street, which was things
[SPEAKER_00]: like deciding what type of products we
would be offering to a company,
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding how do we tell the story of a
particular plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we bring that plant to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get people excited and kind of
that storytelling of different plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always knew at some point that I
might end up working for a company whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it be Ball Horticulture, Selecta,
or Syngenta, and I ended up at Duman
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange, where we make a living of making
plants a beautiful place and the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who is Duman Orange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Duman Orange is the largest breeding
company in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to that way because we started
in 2000 here in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have over time have through a whole
bunch of acquisitions and mergers and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing together of different companies,
we now are the largest, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding company or holder of different
plants in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 53,000 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We operate in 18 different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge scope of what we are
offering and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what our focus is is not only
growing a better place, but also making
[SPEAKER_00]: the world a more sustainable place as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where does Duman Orange kind of
operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of getting back towards
that initial kind of half fan that I
[SPEAKER_00]: started out at the beginning of the
seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Duman Orange focuses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a breeding company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of breeders that work for
us, and we focus on creating new plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating better plants that are more
sustainable, better for the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and better for our growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also own a number of propagation farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking those plants that we've bred,
building them out at a farm, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping them to growers here in the
United States or Canada or globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also own a brokerage firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, say, to Ball Flora plant,
they also own a brokerage firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a brokerage firm is basically a group
of salespeople that help make that
[SPEAKER_00]: connection between the breeder to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all then relies then on the
grower to the retailer to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a product manager, what I do,
lies within this entire part of the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of stop when it gets to the
retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the glue, essentially, between their
breeder and then making sure that that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant comes to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a team of breeders that I work
with, and every year they will come
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through a number of different
breeder trials, and we'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what plants do we want to move forward
with, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to call product management is
the art and science of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to have the science side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do a lot of different trials,
research, both confidential trials at
[SPEAKER_00]: grower level or within breeder trials
across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to deal with sales forecast and
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time for a variety to be retired
because its sales have been decreasing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I really, truly believe in this
really amazing plant that is super awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: for x, y, z reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we grow the business that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about different business plan
development or product launches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also management of a portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Bill was saying, I manage half of
the annuals portfolio for Doom and Orange
[SPEAKER_00]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work specifically with Petunia,
Burbina, Caliber, Koa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also work with all of their different
mixes that we design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I get to be a little more
artsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to have a hand in marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to have a hand in how or some
different retail exclusives that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer, either to be Home Depot or to
box stores or to independent chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with invent planning and execution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have state California spring trials
or art displays that cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parts is also teaching
and presenting and telling that plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll work with our broker teams and
telling them about why is this plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we come out and launch this new
variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it different from the competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it going to be a success for
growers and for the end consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to call that plant storytelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Doom is turning 25 this year,
which is kind of crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been in the industry for
quite some time and working, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have started to recognize some of our
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I didn't put confetti
garden on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confetti garden is a brand of mixed
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hanging baskets or planters that you
would find at a garden center,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a brainchild.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's someone who has created that
design on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Doom came up with the concept of being
able to plant three plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a petunia, a verbena, a calibrachoa,
all into one plug that a grower would then
[SPEAKER_00]: root together and then sell or transplant
on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: A petunia plus was a brand new concept as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A petunia that could actually be in a
small size that you could grow in a quart
[SPEAKER_00]: size pot, which probably to many of us
seems like, well, yeah, duh, that's always
[SPEAKER_00]: the size that I get a petunia in right
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnum Impatience was a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first to market with an
oversized two-inch size New Guinea
[SPEAKER_00]: Impatient, which was unheard of at the
time, and a lot of other product launches
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've had along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with all of this kind of great
fun, it's not always the better roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different stresses that
are happening in our environment right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, whether it be environmental stresses,
whether it be market stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be weather, climate change,
the fact that we have limited dollars as
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers to spend on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to spend it on a luxury like
a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we going to spend it on an
essential thing like plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pose the question out to the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some different stresses that we
think might be influencing the
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture market right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about indiscretionable or
limited income that we could play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest pain point in my side,
supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is that a pain, say, for the
plants themselves, we can sometimes have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues where we either had a snafu at our
propagation farm, or there's weather that
[SPEAKER_00]: plays a role, or there are hangups at the
border, even supply chain issues that we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now seeing a resurgence of that
again now with the dock and port closures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are going to be issues with
plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Availability and soil availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pain points to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria, fungi, viroids especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the biggest,
biggest problems that we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have to also, the amount of
inputs that we put to prevent either
[SPEAKER_00]: insects or diseases, whether it be an IPM
focus, or whether it be a chemical focus,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still is an input that goes into the
final production of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down a short list myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a huge pain point, especially here in
New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues to go up, which I think is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good to be able to help our
employees have a decent cost of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a huge stress on the business
owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we still own and operate an
independent garden center, or own and
[SPEAKER_00]: operate a small mom and pop, say grower,
and still be able to feed and put food on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tables of the people who work for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what breeders are constantly
looking at, is trying to solve those
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those problems that we can
identify as a breeding company?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we sometimes fix those problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, in order to stay
relevant, in this ever-changing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, there's pressures and
influences coming from all different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to constantly innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what doom and orange has
always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were the first to come to market
with, Marvin, you talked about it this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, with day-length neutrality in
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first breeder to come with
day-length neutrality in petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from strawberries and from fruit
production, we take a lot of insights from
[SPEAKER_00]: regular agriculture and apply that to
horticulture, which is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also were the first to come to market
with a concept called basewell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 2010s in Holland and in
Germany, there was a technology where,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to decrease the number of people
at a greenhouse and to speed up production
[SPEAKER_00]: of young plants, they developed a machine
that would pick up eight pieces of an
[SPEAKER_00]: unrooted tree cutting at a time and go
jinkajink, kajinkajink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would pick up those cuttings with their
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would plant them automatically
into a full row or a full tray of liners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They now have those machines where it'll
pop up the unrooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll actually go, and the machine
will find a piece and plant it on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the AutoStix machine strip or
the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with the concept of putting
that unrooted cutting into the clip,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also having it initiated with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes off two weeks' worth of time
for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are they saving on labor,
but now they're saving on production time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also came up, in the heat of COVID,
we came up with this concept called
[SPEAKER_00]: DuraBloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DuraBloom is a series of petunias that
is heat and humidity tolerant and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: pshh, to a hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to a thunderstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have basically a hurricane come
through, huge thunderstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the very next day, the petunias
will be sticking right back up and be
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshiny faces and looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a brand new technology they
came out with as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we're focusing on in the age
of the genome and cool technologies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming along in the medical world,
we are now starting to apply those
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies and predictive breeding to
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2015, we started doing a lot of
work where our R&D team wanted to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on, let's map the genome of all of our
different crops that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start identifying different
traits within those genomes that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to help solve some of our industry's
number one problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then, in 2017, started using artificial
intelligence to help us phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we as the product managers and we
as the breeding team can kind of go out
[SPEAKER_00]: and see within a full greenhouse,
this is a good plant because it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this is a good plant because it has a
lot of flowers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were starting to use AI phenotyping in
order to be able to initially cut out or
[SPEAKER_00]: cull through that first group of seedlings
or trial varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then started using predictive breeding
in 2019 where we were looking actually at
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic material of the first
seedlings that our breeders would come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with as another point to be able to cull
through or to faster decide what varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to move forward with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2020, we opened up our BTC
company, our breeding technology center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had brought all of our research and
development people under one roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the following year,
we came up with a concept called Intrinza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is Intrinza?
[SPEAKER_00]: Intrinza takes the classic breeding or
hybridization practices of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and then is also applying all of
those artificial intelligence breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and puts them together to
basically solve the world's problems or
[SPEAKER_00]: solve horticulture's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 50 different research projects
that are happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are looking at our top number one
crops, identifying what are the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: issues for each of those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say for chrysanthemums or for fall
mums, it's white rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: For petunias, it's tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that can wipe out an entire crop
for a grower if they have one plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: infected, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking within the DNA of each
of those different crops to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: single gene that gives you the resistance
to each of those different diseases or
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's using that DNA that is
inherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not GMO breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually using the genes of the plant
itself, which really coming from someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like me who started out in college when
the first tomato that had been genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified with genes from a fish was like a
brand new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really awesome that we're now at a
point where we're doing breeding that is
[SPEAKER_00]: with its own DNA, which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to do this and our focus
here really is to create stronger,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier plants through this technology,
using it as a sustainable approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we at the end can have varieties
that are healthier, are faster producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't require as many inputs for the
grower or for the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore we end up having less waste
and less inputs for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2021, I was part of the group that
selected the first group of petunias that
[SPEAKER_00]: were fully resistant to tobacco mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco mosaic virus, for those of you who
might not know, it basically creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration within the entire bloom or
petals of the petunia plant and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: also cause a whole lot of stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread like wildfire across an
entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have one plant that you see that
is showing those symptoms, you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had in 2016, Dumen had an unfortunate
case where we had tobacco mosaic virus at
[SPEAKER_00]: our production farm in El Salvador and we
shipped cuttings across the entire North
[SPEAKER_00]: American continent with petunia Johnny
flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have growers to this day who still hate
me, even though I wasn't with the company
[SPEAKER_00]: and say if I ever ship them to EMV ever
again, they will come to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we don't have to worry about that
because we have intrinsic petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95% of our pipeline is TMV resistant,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that a grower can grow Dumen
orange petunias, potentially be infected
[SPEAKER_00]: with TMV from another source and the Dumen
orange petunias will be resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a way of essentially growing
cells around the virus within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the gene that's been turned on that
says, oh, I can recognize there's a virus
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow cells to close it off and
to lock it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge gain here because it basically
means that it's like an insurance policy
[SPEAKER_00]: for a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can safely grow Dumen orange petunias
without any sense of worry or concern that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to lose out on a season's
worth of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sustainability with our company is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond Intrinza, we're looking at trying
to find resistance to white rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: With roses, we're trying to find
resistance to Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at powder mildew
resistance within Kalanchoe, Calibrachoa
[SPEAKER_00]: and Verbena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of other projects that I
can't really talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of stuff is happening,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sustainability remains a really
important part of our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only how we are producing from a
grower's standpoint, but also how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: treating our people at our different farms
across the entire globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also other research projects
that are happening across North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends, Melinda Newth and Amanda
Soliday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amanda Soliday is also a past master's
student here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both at NC State and working on
mapping or accounting for carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon inputs and carbon tracking within
domestic flower cut flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bridget Behe at MSU is working also on
marketing efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is mapping eye movement with
consumers when they go into a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do their eyes track or follow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants do they tend to look at first
or gravitate towards?
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing a lot of that stuff with RFID
tracking and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really amazing in changing the
world of retail as we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also independent companies as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, has anybody heard of
LightBio?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Firefly Petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a GMO Petunia that has been bred
with the genes from, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms actually, that have light
emitting genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within them, it is really, has anybody
seen it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this has like Las Vegas and Disney
World written all over it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to see in just one
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a whole mass of them,
they're pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of really cool and unique stuff
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are interested in
horticulture or think you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in horticulture, there's a lot
of different ways that you can kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved or look and read more,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Flower Endowment,
they are an amazing organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of different grants and
internships that are available for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how my friend Amanda is able to
fund her project with Cut Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Your Future, also a fantastic
organization that is helping get young
[SPEAKER_00]: people especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking like elementary school
through high school, people involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what horticulture is, that it
actually is an industry that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: American Hort, I will bleed American Hort
always till the day I die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of the retail committee that's
there, so helping get people connected
[SPEAKER_00]: with American Hort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the leading association for our
entire industry and they put on Cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, as well as a number of
different educational seminars that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year by Zoom or in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also run the program called the Hort
Scholars Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great internship or way to immerse
yourself into the horticulture industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a lot of different influential people
within the industry and really experience
[SPEAKER_00]: it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, I love the
Horticulture Research Institute or HRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the people that are coming forth
with a lot of different projects that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening right now and partnering with
universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with the research that
focused on boxwood blight and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find more resistant varieties that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, some words of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share some fun facts or just
some phrases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are not t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I've said
that in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers constantly think that plants are
easily accessible or that a garden center
[SPEAKER_00]: should always have the same variety
available at no matter what time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a strawberry being available year
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And retailers are even the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are living and working with living
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be open-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be willing to be nimble and to try new
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter and disperse is a phrase that Dr.
Miller turned me on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an intern, we would go either to the
CLE conference and we would all huddle as
[SPEAKER_00]: students, all as a whole group,
and walk around as a pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always advised us to enter a room and
then disperse, break out, network with new
[SPEAKER_00]: people, meet somebody new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you go to a class or seminar like
this, or if you're going to an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: event, go and meet one new person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might learn something that's really
amazing about that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they might become a contact,
say like Dr. Charlie Hall, who I met,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been a mentor for me for the last 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite phrases from one of
my favorite people of all time,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a past Cornellian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He now works with JR Peters, the
fertilizer company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He once told me, I collect business cards
like zombies collect souls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this age where we're so
technological, hold on to business cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll meet new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build those relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay connected outside of Instagram or a
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect with people on a real level.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of my absolute favorite
books, too, when it comes to horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great reads, regardless of
whatever stage in life you're at or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever focus you want to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zag is a fantastic marketing book written
by Martin Newberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the author of The Brand Gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're really interested in
marketing or branding of any product,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zag is an excellent book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower Confidential written by Amy
Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going on probably 20 years now since
that book was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a wonderful kind of overview of how
breeding works and how horticulture works
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of those kind of influential
touch points within the history of flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we got to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love the book Chaos Monkeys Break
Shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Antonio Martinez.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked for Facebook in the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also created the algorithm that made
ads on Facebook and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have him to thank for all of that and
ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a wonderful read because it talks
about, too, how to be nimble, how to think
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the box, how in a crazy time when
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter were
[SPEAKER_00]: all coming about, how you just had this
abandon of just being able to be creative
[SPEAKER_00]: every day and try something new and that
there were no expenses to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, one of my
favorite plant geeks of all time,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly Norris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in Des Moines, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be the director for the Des
Moines, Iowa Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a wonderful plant nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are fun things coming from him
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is definitely a spot to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, we'll leave everything else
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions, comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: On some of the pain points that you were
talking about, regulatory, one of them
[SPEAKER_07]: with all the innovation that you're coming
up with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, is one of the pain
points, is regulatory processes or
[SPEAKER_00]: following trademarks and things like that
one of the things we have to go through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will it slow down maybe the breeding
process, I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to trademark a lot of our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending upon the crop that you're
working with, I'm fortunate that I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of our fastest crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petunias are one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill, I was telling Bill earlier today
that you are expected to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement or a new color or a new
variety every, say, two years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That freshness index or how frequently you
create new plants is extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulatory issues can really slow that
down, especially if you're going for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: patents or for trademarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, if we see something in
the trial stage that my counterpart and I
[SPEAKER_00]: that we love, we'll start that a little
early to kind of get that ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of regulations when it
comes to what plants we put at which
[SPEAKER_00]: production farms and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have production farms in El Salvador,
Guatemala, Kenya, Ethiopia, Spain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really funny because our farm in
Spain is down the road from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if any of you were in the talk with Marvin
this morning, it's down the road from the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry farm, so I know exactly where
that was, as well as in Germany and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having right now a hard time
actually moving one of our crops into our
[SPEAKER_00]: farms in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is that the
governments either don't want us to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be, it happens a lot,
too, if we're trying to move a crop here
[SPEAKER_00]: into the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a farm that's in California that
we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through plant quarantines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA can put a lot of regulations and
say, no, we don't want this plant to come
[SPEAKER_00]: from XYZ country for both plant reasons as
well as for political reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it is a huge, huge pain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious how you found the transitions,
like in your case, from lettuce as to far
[SPEAKER_06]: culture, so edible to not edible,
and how you kind of like mentally
[SPEAKER_06]: rearranged your, like, my vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the question was, how did I get from
lettuce and wanting to work for Monsanto?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To wanting to go into horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost had a slide on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have watched The Good Place,
they talk about a concept called Jeremy
[SPEAKER_00]: Barame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my life has been very Jeremy
Barame, kind of going all over the place,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 2000s, I think really that
when the first GMO plant came out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, that was such a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, you can get this philosophical
and political about it, but I didn't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I wanted to play God in terms of what
genes should be in which plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also realized in botany that I loved
playing with plants, but I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a lab all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't want to go down that road
with lettuce anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, in graduate school,
I went into weed ecology because I still
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted, permaculture was a brand new
concept at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still felt really passionate about
helping growers and farmers grow in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: holistic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my project was on organic gardening
and how do we take the best of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, take the best of conventional
gardening, put those two together and
[SPEAKER_00]: create like, you know, Captain Planet
version of growing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in, you know, 2026, 2010, the weed
market or agriculture market was still
[SPEAKER_00]: very led by, it was male driven and it was
chemical driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to work for a chemical
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was tired of going to farms and
growers saying, you're too pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where's the guy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was Bill's classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being an intern just on a whim for a
summer at the test garden, so I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this is really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still get my hands dirty playing in
the garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The CLE conference opened my eyes to like,
wow, marketing is a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really passionate about getting
plants into the hands of people and going
[SPEAKER_00]: that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took me a while to realize that
product management is like the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: Steph Whitehouse job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of being super sciencey and analytical and
choosing, you know, 100 plants out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 plants that you could get in a
trial season and focusing on that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: group that that's what I wanted to end up
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say in like company meetings that I
bleed orange because I think I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's how I got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeremy, bear me away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: During COVID, there was an uptick in
people interested in gardening and pick
[SPEAKER_02]: your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that trend still staying high or is it
starting to drop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, how's the industry reacting to
whatever trend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did see, Marvin was asking,
like, how has the market changed since
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID that we saw that uptick in consumers
having an awareness about gardening and
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to garden at home, both from a
food producing as well as from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I can't tell you how many plants
have grown since COVID.
I grew up in a private private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew in backyard gardens and privacy
screens that I designed for people
[SPEAKER_00]: because, oh, my God, I'm home all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh, I can see my neighbor on my
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as a company had a huge uptick and it
was bonkers, not only from a retail
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, but also any breeding company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like printing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the first spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2024 was really the first year we
started seeing growers have a course
[SPEAKER_00]: correction or writing of the market,
as we like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have started to see some decreases in
some key numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So geraniums have started to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales of petunia, verbena, calibrachoa,
because those are also linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go down on one crop, you're going to
go down on the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are starting to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also heard from major retailers
that they themselves have had a course
[SPEAKER_00]: correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot, I can share this, had a really
crappy third and second quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of their growers who sat on all
the material that is generally pay by
[SPEAKER_00]: scan, if they're not shipping that
material to the stores, they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start rewriting what their numbers are for
the upcoming season and year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly amazing to know how
intricately interconnected each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: different branches of the industry
actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have, and the consumer is the
one who's constantly driving the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can talk about how great this
sparkle petunia is until I'm blue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if my mom isn't going to the garden
center and buying that plant, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll sit at the farm or at the retailer
or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back to we're predicting that our
numbers are going to be back to that 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: type market size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still things like the fact that we
have Intrinza as a major technology still
[SPEAKER_00]: puts us at the forefront in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's, we're still okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the question was about what is the
market for like for houseplants versus
[SPEAKER_00]: state ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say the house market or house plant
market was had a huge resurgent actually
[SPEAKER_00]: before 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that 2015 to 2020 market,
that was like the heyday for houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even within COVID, it was still really
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that house plant market has completely
tanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like if you're a retailer right
now, you cannot sell a house plant to like
[SPEAKER_00]: save your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason being is because
the plants that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialable or easy to produce on a
grower level, everybody has them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has collected all of those
individual houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ones that are still the growers
that are still doing really well are those
[SPEAKER_00]: mom and pop niche growers who are selling,
you know, Marble Queen on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's still a real big push
and popular movement towards pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and towards natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually one of the things I is a
pressure for us as a breeding company that
[SPEAKER_00]: we constantly battle with of do we want to
promote native plants or do we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote our own breeding or how do we
marry those two together of maybe we breed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a crop that is a native plant and take
some of those genes from the natives that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of make it a superior, better growing
plant but still is, you know, pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, that kind of thing.
So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're close on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you might ask?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just shout out, does Geneva have any

[SPEAKER_00]: Does Geneva have any questions?
