[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab works on DNA methylation and
epigenetic inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll tell you about today is a
problem that we've been working on for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years, which is how do plants and
other eukaryotes actually manage to
[SPEAKER_00]: inherit patterns of DNA methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: on chromatin?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does epigenetic inheritance work
around this structure where DNA is ramped
[SPEAKER_00]: around histones?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start the talk by introducing DNA
methylation and epigenetic inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll tell you about our work and
try to understand how this deals with
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll finish up with some
evolutionary implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, just to introduce epigenetic
inheritance and how DNA methylation plays
[SPEAKER_00]: a role in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is nicely illustrated by this
herbidopsis gene called FWA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene is normally silenced in
herbidopsis plants in vegetative tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's silenced by DNA methylation that
is present on the promoter and the start
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now about 25 years ago, Martin
Kornief's lab isolated a semi-dominant lay
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering mutant that they called FWA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they tried to figure out what was
causing this, they found this gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: was overexpressed in the leaves of these
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were no genetic differences
between this FWA and this FWA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this phenotype is that
this FWA version is not methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants are genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any DNA sequence
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is that here this DNA
is methylated and here it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two methyl states are very
stable in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least these plants will always be early
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene will always be methylated
and silenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genes will be always late flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene will always be methylated
and active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, they're stable enough that
you can cross them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cross these plants with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these methylated and methylated
alleles will stay methylated and
[SPEAKER_00]: unmethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will segregate as Mendelian alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this behaves as a perfectly normal
Mendelian trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just a property that occurs
in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around the same time, Rico Cohen's lab
described a epigenetic allele in Toadflax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toadflax normally has bilaterally
symmetric flowers, but a wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: normally occurring version of these
species has these so-called peloric
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, which have radial symmetry and
very different arrangements of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is caused by methylation and
silencing of the cyclotia transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allele was actually described,
as far as I know, for the first time by
[SPEAKER_00]: Linnaeus in 1750.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very old allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been around for at least 250
years in natural populations of Toadflax.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these methylated and unmethylated
states can in nature be quite stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ability of DNA methylation to
carry epigenetic information has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with how it's initiated and maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll tell you today is fairly
specific for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works in a similar way in animals,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really the plant-specific part,
where in plants DNA methylation is
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated by this pathway called
RNA-directed DNA methylation, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: derivative of RNA interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very simplified version of how
this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a transcript is made that is recognized
as aberrant in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps it's double-stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps there are other issues with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it is converted upon
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this transcription occurs by poll 2,
but it also occurs by a plant-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: version of polymerase 2 called poll 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's converted by an RNA-directed DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase called RDR2
into double-stranded version, that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: then processed by a Dicer nuclease into
small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small RNAs get loaded into a factor
complex that contains an organelle
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this appears to interact with a
nascent RNA made by another derivative of
[SPEAKER_00]: poll 2 called poll 5 that has an accessory
nucleus and remodeling protein called
[SPEAKER_00]: DRD1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about these nucleus and
remodeling proteins more in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this interaction somehow activates a
DNA methyltransferase, which in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis is called DRM2, that
methylates the DNA, and it represses
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription from the slogans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the DRM methyltransferases and their
animal homologs called DNAMD3,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can at least to some extent methylate
cytosines in any sequence context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the methylation I'll talk about
today is methylation of cytosines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the predominant form of DNA
methylation in eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in plants, if the RNA signal is turned
off, then this methylation would disappear
[SPEAKER_00]: because after DNA replication,
the old strand here in black keeps its
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation, but the new strand in red is
synthesized un-methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another methyltransferase
system that is there to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation propagated across generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a methyltransferase called
MET1 in plants and DNAMD1 in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is with at least one
accessory protein, it recognizes CG
[SPEAKER_00]: dinucleotides that are methylated in one
strand, but not in the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it methylates the un-methylated
cytosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these sites are symmetrical,
this catalysis essentially allows
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-conservative inheritance of DNA
methylation patterns every time the DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the core catalytic process
that, as far as we know, makes DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation epigenetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows for the methylation
patterns to go through mitosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at least in plants, to go through
meiosis very effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plants, there's yet another pathway
for DNA methylation that I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have copied the wrong version of
my talk into this computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did, we might need to do a little
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, because on that version of the
talk, this slide was meant to come first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first wanted to tell you about the
function of DNA methylation in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major function appears to be to
silence transposable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic idea is that transposons will
be methylated, and this methylation will
[SPEAKER_00]: be heritably maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will silence these transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will preserve the integrity of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then gene regulation of the kind I
showed you with FWA will happen when a
[SPEAKER_00]: transposon will insert in the vicinity of
a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will become methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this has the potential to silence
the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is also a type of DNA methylation
in plants and in many animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present within active genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we won't really talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, the entire talk will be focused
on transposon methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll just go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plants, particularly in
transposons, there's another DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to DNA-MT3 and DNA-MT1,
there are chromomethylases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are methyltransferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one in Arabidopsis is called CMT3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that methylates a context called CHG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called this because H stands for
anything but G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just done to separate this
context from the one catalyzed by MET1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these methyltransferases are linked to
a histone modification called HTK9Me2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the dimethylation of lysine 9 of
histine H3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all kinds of DNA methylation,
all these three pathways converge in
[SPEAKER_00]: transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these DRMs are not very
sequence specific, their methylation is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally referred to as CHH, see anything
but G, anything but G, to separate it from
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind that's catalyzed by MET1 and the
kind that's catalyzed by CMT3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for the slice mix-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one final thing I wanted to mention
is that it's well-known in plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few years that pretty much all the
CG methylation is catalyzed by this enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: MET1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the CHG methylation is catalyzed
by this enzyme CMT3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all the CHH methylation is
catalyzed by the DRM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was something else missing from
this picture that was mediating some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this asymmetric CHH methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've introduced DNA
methylation and epigenetic inheritance,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get to the heart of the talk,
which is how this actually works within
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I showed you so far is
methyltransferase is methylating DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this DNA is wrapped around the
nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this imposes certain limitations on
DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these limitations, I think,
became kind of clear quite a while ago
[SPEAKER_00]: when Eric Richards discovered this gene
called DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DDM1 came out of a genetic screen for
mutants with large losses of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DDM1 turned out to be a type of
protein called a nucleosome remodeler that
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically an ATP-driven machine that
does work on nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are proteins that can assemble
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can space out nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can disassemble nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take out a part of a nucleosome
and put another part in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of these work engines that
work with chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the identification of this gene
made it clear that the nucleosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin had an important influence on
DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, people figured out that DDM1
loss of function causes major methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: losses in all sequence contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it affects CG, CHG, and CHH
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is required for methylation in
transposons, but not in genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene methylation I mentioned is
not affected really by DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a close homolog in mammals called
LSH that appears to do more or less the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how DDM1 actually interfaced with DNA
methyltransferase systems, including
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-directed DNA methylation, is really
unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it actually was mediating
methylation in all the different sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, we approached this by
analyzing DNA methylation genome-wide in
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 mutants and mutants that affected
this RNA-directed DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two mutants we worked with the
most is RDR2, this mutant in this
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and DRD1,
this nucleosome remodeler, which
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically seems to be required for
RNA-directed DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein that's actually homologous
to DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be showing you quite a lot of
these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are meta-analyses that show an
averaging of all the DNA methylation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular kind of sequence, in this case,
transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll always be showing you transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transposons are aligned at the 5 prime
end and the 3 prime end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the methylation across all
transposons is averaged in both
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting an average amount of DNA
methylation for CG, CHG, and CHH.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one type, in red, methylation is high
for CG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutating RDDM doesn't have much of an
effect on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 has a very strong effect on CG
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And double mutants between DDM1 and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this DRD1, so double mutants between
DDM1 and RNA-directed DNA methylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little bit stronger, but just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really very little methylation
left in DDM1 already.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CHG methylation, the situation is a
bit in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RDDM mutants have a bit of a stronger
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 has intermediate levels of
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the double mutants have very low
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for CHH, it's even more dramatic where
RDDM mutants or DDM1 have these
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost all the methylation is gone in
DDM1, RDDM doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the bottom line here is that
DDM1 and RNA-directed DNA methylation are
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary methylation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get rid of both of them,
you basically get rid of almost all the
[SPEAKER_00]: transposon methylation in the Arabidopsis
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next thing we try to do is to
link this phenomenon to the
[SPEAKER_00]: methyltransferases that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first two parts here are just
what we already knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CG methylation, if we mutate MET1,
there's almost nothing left.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CHG methylation, if we mutate CMD3,
there's almost nothing left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a homolog of CMD3 called CMD2 has a
very small effect on this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at CHH methylation,
we find that in DRM2 mutants, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the methyltransferase linked to RDDM,
we have a partial loss of methylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which looks exactly the same as the loss
of methylation in RDDM mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the CMD2 methyltransferase,
this chromomethylase that is homologous to
[SPEAKER_00]: CMD3, there's a very, very strong loss of
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between these two, they account for
all the non-CGH methylation, all the CHH
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CMD2 was this missing bit that was
responsible for DNA methylation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you probably are noticing that
the shapes of these lines are different,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mutants that belong to the same
pathway resemble each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RDDM mutants have this kind of
bell-shaped shape, and DDM1 mutants or
[SPEAKER_00]: CMD2 mutants, they have this smiley face
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually quite informative
about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a zoom in on the CHH
methylation plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing here is we're aligning
transposons from either edges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going into the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So close to the point of alignment,
the methylation average is the small
[SPEAKER_00]: transposons or the edges of longer
transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we move in further and further in,
we're getting methylation from bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time we're in here, it's 4KBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only large elements will be averaged
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these different shapes actually
tell you about the kinds of transposons
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in RDDM mutants, it's the smaller
transposons that are here, the edges,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are losing methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in CMD2 and in DDM1, it's mostly the
larger transposons that are here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a more formal analysis of
this, where here we are averaging
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation with respect to the size of
transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in wild type, there's not much of a
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in DDM1 and in CMD2, the bigger
transposon, the bigger the loss of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for RDDM, for DRM2, or for DRD1,
the bigger the transposon, the smaller the
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sizes of transposable elements
are relying more on different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: RDDM is more for smaller elements,
and DDM1 and CMD2 for this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation are more for larger elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is interesting, but it's not
terribly satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does transposon size matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, what matters isn't the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters is the type of chromatin
these transposons inhabit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happens that smaller
transposons in neurobidopsis are more
[SPEAKER_00]: rechromatic, and bigger transposons are
more heterochromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually what makes the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that just in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to help you visualize what's
going on in the particular example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a short transposon,
and the neurobidopsis would be a long one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the methylation in wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the short transposon, in DRD1 and
DRM, all the methylation is gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in DDM1 and CMD2, it's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the long transposon, in DRD1 and DRM2,
the methylation is mostly there,
[SPEAKER_00]: except right at the edges of the
transposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for DDM1 and CMD2, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the methylation at the edges that are
still there, but the middle is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the double mutants, all the
methylation basically is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these remnants of methylation here
correlate with the small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pathway is driven by small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the absence of DDM1 and CMD2,
the little bits of remaining methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: are catalyzed by RDBM through the small
RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now an analysis that looks
explicitly at this question of chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this, we're confining ourselves
for smaller transposons, transposons which
[SPEAKER_00]: are smaller than 500 base pairs,
so that size variation is not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just here calculating
correlation coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these bar shows a correlation
coefficient between the loss of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation in DDM1 in three different
sequence contexts, CG, CHG, CHH,
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with a particular feature of
chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows is that nucleosome
densities and histone modifications
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with heterochromatin,
like HGK9 dimethylation, are positively
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with loss of methylation in
DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And histone modifications associated with
U-chromatin are negatively correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a DDM1 is much more required for
heterochromatic transposons, and it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: less required for U-chromatic transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing in reverse is true for
methylation guided by small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same kind of analysis for
methylation that depends on DRD1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the component of RDBM, and here,
nucleosome density and heterochromatin are
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively correlated, and U-chromatin is
positively correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RDBM doesn't work very well in
heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works much better in U-chromatic
transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one feature here, really,
which isn't heterochromatin or
[SPEAKER_00]: U-chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nucleosome density correlates
negatively with RDBM and positively with
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get back to that a little bit
later in the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, for now, heterochromatin,
DDM1, and U-chromatin, RDBM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a model summarizing this
part of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we have a typical long
heterochromatic transposon and a short
[SPEAKER_00]: U-chromatic transposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're methylated differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U-chromatic transposon will be
methylated by this RDBM system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the CHH methylation will be mostly
guided by DRMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the heterochromatin requires DDM1
for DNA methylation, and this somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: allows methylation by Met1 and CMD3 and
CMD4.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMD2 of this transposable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this links DDM1 to heterochromatin,
but it doesn't really explain what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: about heterochromatin that makes DDM1
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that we need DDM1
heterochromatin more than U-chromatin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where our work with DDM1
intersected with our work with another
[SPEAKER_00]: component of chromatin, linker histin H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So H1 is a very abundant protein that's
found in most eukaryotes, including in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a highly schematic picture of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is DNA coming in and out of the
nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: H1 binds to the DNA between nucleosomes,
the so-called linker DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's called linker histone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also binds, though, to the
nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dual interaction with the linker
DNA and the nucleosome is hypothesized to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of be a vice that stabilizes the
nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so H1 is associated with
heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's associated with inaccessible
chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can impede nucleosome remodeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became interested in H1 because
it's been reported to cause interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and strange effects on DNA methylation in
various species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So H1 mutations in the fungus called
Ascambolis were shown to cause overall
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in DNA methylation, basically
across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylation would increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mice, H1 mutations are published to
have localized losses of DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain particular regions of the
genome would lose DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Arabidopsis, a study suggested that
there were sort of random effects in DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: H1 mutations would cause increases and
decreases more or less randomly throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very curious about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we actually did is to
map H1 across the genome just to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, it goes to
heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two H1 genes in Arabidopsis,
H1.1, H1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are ChIP-seq data where both of
them localize to around the centromere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where heterochromatin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where most transposons in
Arabidopsis live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this protein is highly enriched in
heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already sort of knew this from
cytology down many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an enrichment of H1 in
transposons because transposons live in
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something is enriched in
heterochromatin, it will generally be
[SPEAKER_00]: found in transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both versions of H1 are highly enriched
in transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're specifically enriched in
heterochromatic transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we separate, based on histone
modifications, transposons to the
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatic and eukromatic,
then heterochromatic transposons are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly enriched for H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eukromatic transposons are not
enriched at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So H1 is in Arabidopsis heterochromatic
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only in heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually found in genes, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's highly enriched in
heterochromatic transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at DNA methylation,
we saw something that was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That H1 had kind of a dual effect on DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its most obvious effect across the genome
was an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all three sequence contexts,
CG, CHG, and CHH, H1 mutants had more
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation in transposons than wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was particularly dramatic at CHG
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was in all three contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shape of this methylation was
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this curve is a lot steeper here than
the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for CHH methylation, you can actually
see it intersects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it basically means is that
shorter, more eukromatic elements are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually losing methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And longer, more heterochromatic elements
are gating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a more formal analysis of
this, where we are dividing transposons
[SPEAKER_00]: into heterochromatic and eukromatic types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are comparing methylation
between H1 and wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plotting the overall distribution of
the differences between the H1 mutant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these curves here represent the
distribution of the methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the curve is shifted to the
right of this dotted line, it means it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more methylated than H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the curve is shifted to the left,
it means that these sequences are less
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated in H1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for all three sequence contexts,
heterochromatic transposons are
[SPEAKER_00]: hypermethylated in H1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're hypermethylated pretty evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these brownish curves have a nice
Gaussian shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukromatic elements, as shown in red,
lose DNA methylation in H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lose it a bit less evenly,
especially for CG methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this long tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some sequences which have
very strong loss of CG methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In H1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this helps to reconcile
some of the conflicting DNA methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: data that have been published about H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have two effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes losses of methylation and gains,
but in different sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes increases in heterochromatin and
losses in eukromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this generalized increase of DNA
methylation in heterochromatin looked a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to us like the opposite of what
happens in DDM1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 mutants have a generalized loss of
DNA methylation in heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we have a generalized gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're curious what would happen if we
actually put these mutants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that in the absence of
H1, the DDM1 phenotype is greatly,
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly relieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the same kinds of plots shown
for H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, green wild type, in red, DDM1 in
blue, and two replicates of compound
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants between H1 and DDM1 in brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all sequence contexts, the amounts
of DNA methylation in these H1,
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 compound mutants are much higher than
the DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly dramatic for CHH
methylation, where here, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the compound mutants look like H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just examples of what this
looks like at heterochromatic elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: where wild type is in red, H1 is in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can kind of see, if you look
closely enough in this element,
[SPEAKER_00]: this effect where methylation is increased
in H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This very jaggy kind of outline turns out
very smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in DDM1, these transposons lose
methylation, as pretty much all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the compound mutants, this loss of
methylation is largely reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we examine what happens in these
compound mutants carefully, what we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually find is that this methylation
dichotomy between euchromatic and
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatic transposons that exists in
DDM1 mutants disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, heterochromatic and euchromatic
transposons are behaving more or less the
[SPEAKER_00]: same with respect to methylation loss and
DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll walk you through this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plots, each of these lines
represents the ratio of methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: between a mutant and wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So H1 is a ratio of H1 to wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blue line is the H1 DDM1 compound
mutant versus wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black is DDM1 mutant versus wild
type for the three sequence context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for DDM1, it shows the characteristic
DDM1 phenotype where, oh, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we are arranging them with
respect to heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most euchromatic transposons are
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most heterochromatic transposons are
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is counted as the amount of this
histone modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transposons are arranged from
euchromatic to heterochromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we get from more euchromatic to
more heterochromatic transposons,
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA methylation drops in DDM1 mutants
in all three sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in H1, these red lines, you see the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bit of loss in euchromatic
elements and a bit of gain in
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatic elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurs in CHG, and this occurs in
CHH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at H1 DDM1, what we find
is something that looks very much like H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a relatively, relatively flat
relationship for CG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the same kind of shape here as for
H1 for CHG and almost identical
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation in CHH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we actually take H1 out of the
equation, if we just superimpose these
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, so we treat H1 as the background
and compare H1 to H1 DDM1, then we get
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively flat lines for both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is saying is that when H1 is
gone, then euchromatic transposons and
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatic transposons lose DNA
methylation to about the same extent in
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the more detailed model is that
at least a major thing that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: heterochromatin require DDM1 is H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's the presence of H1 in
heterochromatin that really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: requires DDM1 activity to allow these
methyltransferases to do their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this model, though, still doesn't
explain what it is that DDM1 does exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of activity does it perform that
allows methyltransferases to do their
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does it actually interact with H1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it remove H1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's what it does, why do H1
mutants have only a partial rescue of the
[SPEAKER_00]: DDM1 phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a number of things to address
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is to examine the
relationship between DDM1 and H1 DDM1 DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation and nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since DDM1 is a nucleosome remodeler and
supposed to work on nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get to the data, I just want
to conceptually explain what we are up
[SPEAKER_00]: against.
[SPEAKER_00]: In complex genomes like carabidopsis or
humans or mouse, nucleosomes are not
[SPEAKER_00]: arranged the same way all across the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not arranged with equal
reliability either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some places in the genome where
nucleosomes are positioned reliably,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that if you look at one
chromosome, another chromosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: a third chromosome, 10,000 chromosomes,
the nucleosomes are going to be all pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you average them together with
whatever analysis you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get a nice representation
of the nucleosome placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other parts of the genome,
there are nucleosomes that are positioned
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one chromosome, nucleosome will be
in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another chromosome will be in this
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another chromosome will be in this
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't mean these nucleosomes are
not stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that every time chromatin is
assembled after cell division,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleosome will occupy a slightly
different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you average all of this,
you get something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really get much useful
information out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to understand how
something like DNA methylation relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleosomes, the first order of business
is to find places that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is where you can learn
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places that look like this basically
scramble all the information about where
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleosomes really sit on each individual
piece of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this in mind, I'm going to skip a
lot of analysis and kind of just get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a heat map where the redder the
color, the higher the feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a heat map of nucleosomes
in H1, DD, and 1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each line is a different piece of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is centered on a well-positioned
nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these represent these reliably
positioned areas of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are places in the genome where
nucleosomes sit in more or less the same
[SPEAKER_00]: places in all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look at DNA methylation
there, what you get is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks similarly equally well-arranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now CG methylation,
these H1, DD, and 1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so red would be more methylation,
blue would be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So methylation is in these well-defined
stripes that are in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an averaging of this type
of data compressed into a single averaged
[SPEAKER_00]: graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gray are the nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be this bright nucleosome
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solid lines of DNA methylation in
the CG context.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue is H1, black is wild type,
brown is H1, DDM1, and orange is DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brown line just represents the
average of this data where DNA methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: is now highly periodic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it oscillates between very low levels
of DNA methylation in the nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, where DNA is wrapped around the
histones and nearly wild type levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation in the linker DNA between
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the same thing in the much
smaller extent in DDM1 mutants where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more methylation remaining in the
space between nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's essentially no methylation
where the nucleosome sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the same thing for the other kinds of
DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for CHG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can see that this oscillation
actually exists in all genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: including in wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a preference for nucleosome
linkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's much, much more dramatic in H1,
DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same for CHH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put H1 and wild type here because
the line intersects will be much too
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically looks similar to this,
where you have this periodicity that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very prominent in H1, DDM1 double
mutants, but not in DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's see if I, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember I told you that DDM1 actually
has a mammalian homolog called LSH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to see if we could
basically see the same kind of phenomena
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in LSH mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's DNA methylation data available
for LSH mutant mouse cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we are aligning
sequences centered on the binding sites of
[SPEAKER_00]: a protein called CTCF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CTCF is a mammalian protein that is
well known to orient nucleosomes around
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of forms well positioned
nucleosomes arrays around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also depletes DNA methylation where
it binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gray line here are nucleosomes in
mouse cells around CTCF sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they show some periodicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue line is wild type DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line is LSH mutant DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in wild type there's a little bit of
periodicity here, but in LSH there's much
[SPEAKER_00]: more pronounced periodicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a fair bit like the periodicity
in DDM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This analysis is much, much cooler than
what we did here in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually something that my postdoc
just did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this needs a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to show this to you
because I think it shows that this really
[SPEAKER_00]: works more or less the same probably in
plants and in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to explain what we think
these data means using this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least a large part of how we think
this works is that if we start with
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin, the DNA is wrapped in
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between, it's associated with LH1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what DDM1 does is it does what
nucleosome modelers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves or partially disassembles
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps what it can do is can make a
loop of DNA that comes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this activity, it makes the
DNA accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To metal transferases like MET1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because H1 actually doesn't just bind the
linker DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also binds to the nucleosome surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to imagine how DDM1 can do
what it does without also disrupting
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts with H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remodels the nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kicks out H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it exposes DNA to the DNA
transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't have H1 in the system,
then the linkers are that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible to DNA transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, we think, is a part of the
reason why in H1 mutants, heterochromatin
[SPEAKER_00]: is hypermethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because linker DNA is more methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this here, where in H1
mutants, linker DNA is more methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually true for all sequence
contacts, including CGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see the oscillation very
well at this scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't have DDM1, then there isn't
a remodeler to allow the methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: transferases to access the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the H1 is not as stable as the
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known that H1 comes on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively stable protein in its
association with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not nearly as stable as nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this dynamic binding and unbinding
of H1 allows some access to DNA
transferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methyl transferases in DDM1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this, we think, is why you see some
methylation in the linkers of DDM1
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants, but not in the cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the double mutants in H1 and
DDM1, there still isn't a remodeler to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow access to the nucleosome cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the linkers are relatively available,
because H1 isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because H1 is concentrated in
heterochromatin, this removal of H1 has a
[SPEAKER_00]: much stronger effect on heterochromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose H1, and heterochromatin becomes
much more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your chromatin doesn't change too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then in H1-DDM1, we get this really
big difference in heterochromatin between
[SPEAKER_00]: cores and linkers, because the linkers are
accessible now without H1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cores are still relatively
inaccessible, because DDM1 isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well we have it developed so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite this simple, but this is
the first approximation of how we think
[SPEAKER_00]: H1-DDM1 influenced DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to finish up the talk, I want to go a
little bit into evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my lab, this is actually a
substantial interest, trying to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how DNA methylation evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've profiled DNA methylation in a
number of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we saw this pattern of
methylation, this was a pretty strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: strong feeling of deja vu, because we've
seen this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this before in other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our analysis, some of the species
that we've looked at is a particular group
[SPEAKER_00]: of green algae called the mammalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green algae, which is to say plants,
are a very diverse group of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But which embryo-fides, of which land
plants are a part, make up just one
[SPEAKER_00]: branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our knowledge about these guys in
general and about their DNA methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically is highly limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of knowledge about
Arabidopsis DNA methylation that's present
[SPEAKER_00]: in D-sequence contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some knowledge about DNA
methylation in a couple of other groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: algae, like the group where clomidomonas
is, and also the species called chlorella.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these other groups here are a
bit of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked at this particular group,
which we did partly because they're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the smallest, free-living
eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were curious to know what they were
doing with their DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these species that we looked
at have CG methylation in their genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these species are actually quite
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 500 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not clear if they were from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pattern of methylation was very
odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are representative parts of the
genome from these two species,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the methylation is in blue and the
exons are in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these species have methylation
throughout their genome, except in
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's present in this very regular
pattern, where there's a short patch of
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA methylation followed by a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a short patch and a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a short patch and a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pattern is nucleosomal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by mapping nucleosomes, what we could
show is that the methylation fits between
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these species, this is now
representative genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylation is in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleosomes are in gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the methylation fits right between the
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a more general analysis,
where we're aligning at zero the first
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated base in each one of these
methylated clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking, for our starting point,
the transition between unmethylated and
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And averaging methylation, going out 500
base pairs in both directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: or nucleosomes in gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what these analyses show is that
actually the relationship between DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation and nucleosomes is very,
very strict in these genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methylation is all present between
nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically never present in the
nucleosome core.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genomes have everywhere,
and by default, the kind of methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern that we find in Arabidopsis
transposons when we mutate H1 and DDM1
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, this kind of methylation
pattern wasn't just present in these green
[SPEAKER_00]: algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually present in several very
deeply branched lineages of eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a reasonably representative
tree of eukaryotic diversity, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that have this kind of
linker-specific DNA methylation are in
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other groups that have DNA methylation
everywhere are in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was very puzzling about this was
that this linker-specific pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation was interspersed with species
which didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't confined to one particular part
of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this group of green algae I just told
you about has this pattern of methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other green algae don't, and land
plants don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heptifides have a very, very similar
pattern DNA methylation to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, however, are very distantly related
to other eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make much of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in straminopiles, brown algae have a
pattern basically indistinguishable from
[SPEAKER_00]: these green algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But diatoms, their relatives, have a very
normal-looking methylation of transposons
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't appear to be confined to
linkers at all, at least based on looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of the animals or plants or fungi
we've looked at has very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: linker-limited methylation either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't really understand how this
was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think our data with H1 and DDM1
suggests an explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not that difficult,
the transition between these two kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can convert Arabidopsis, at least in
part of its genome, from a overall
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation pattern to a linker-specific
pattern by making basically three
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, DDM1 and 2H1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's relatively easy to imagine
how small regulatory changes in nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: remodeling can give you a species where
methylation is only in linkers or where
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just thank the people who did the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CMT2 analysis was done by a graduate
student, Ping Hong Zee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early work on H1 and DDM1 was done by
a former postdoc, Asaf Zemak, and a former
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student, Yvonne Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more recent work on DDM1 and LSH was
from a current postdoctoral fellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Lyons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the evolutionary work I mentioned at
the end was that of a former postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Huff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
