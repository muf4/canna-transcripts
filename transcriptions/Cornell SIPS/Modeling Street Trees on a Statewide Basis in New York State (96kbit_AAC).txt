[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of my talk is Modeling Street
Trees on a Statewide Basis in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what I'm doing is it's a
state of the state of street trees in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a statewide assessment of street
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to define what a street tree is,
it's a tree growing in the public right of
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the benefit of the community,
that's how I'm defining it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And public right of way typically is most
often is a tree on like this between the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalk and the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you say for the benefit of the
public, that isn't typically, that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: originally what street trees were about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were basically for the amusement and
pleasure of the noble classes in Paris.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the American model is far more
democratic, at least in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just, you know, it's something
you see everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fixture in everyday life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although when we don't see them,
we go, gee, what's wrong with this
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood in Lima as compared to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we associate street trees in many ways
with the aesthetics of the community,
[SPEAKER_01]: the identity of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But increasingly what we'd like to think
about is the benefits and ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: services associated with street trees,
which is something I'm very concerned with
[SPEAKER_01]: not only in my work here, but with my work
for sustainable sites initiative in
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ecosystem services can include
storm water reduction, air quality
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement, energy conservation,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're basically proportional to the
amount of leaf surface area associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see droplets of
precipitation intercepted by this leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Forest Service has gotten very
interested in conceptualizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about large landscape scale urban
forestry and canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done, invested a lot of time
and money in canopy cover assessments for,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this landscape scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're asked, they ask two
questions basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much tree canopy do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And associated with that, how many
ecosystem benefits do I have associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much tree canopy could I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many planting spaces in a way are
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a very useful way to look
at what exists and what you could have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't answer a fundamental
question at a much more discreet scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what tree species should I plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remote sensing, hyperstructure,
hypospectral remote sensing is not all
[SPEAKER_01]: that reliable in terms of identifying tree
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also doesn't answer a larger
question such as how many ash trees are
[SPEAKER_01]: vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, the emerald ash borer is
an invasive pest species that is killing
[SPEAKER_01]: ash trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the Asian longhorn
beetle, which is killing maple trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are issues at a larger than local
scale, a statewide scale, that are of
[SPEAKER_01]: concern to people like the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the work I've done is really targeted
towards answering these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I say scale or level,
you know, we typically collect data at a
[SPEAKER_01]: very discreet scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we aggregate it to the scale of
the village, for instance, and write a
[SPEAKER_01]: report.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other wider, larger scales
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, New York State is really,
what I'm basically doing is extrapolating
[SPEAKER_01]: from this scale of the village or the
municipality to that of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, when you start
extrapolating, when you start getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: a larger scale, you sort of lose a lot of
your resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose some of the detail associated
with that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tradeoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my goals in conducting this assessment,
and basically I was working with the DEC,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is, some of these are stipulated
by them, but basically I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify the prevalent, the most common
street tree species in general in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to estimate the numbers for those
prevalent street tree species in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to estimate the annual
benefits provided by street trees as
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forest Service has a program called,
a program called iTree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people love it, some people
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEC asked me to do it using that
program, so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it quantifies, in monetary terms,
ecosystem and other benefits such as
[SPEAKER_01]: energy conservation, property value,
and stormwater reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do all these three goals,
I was, I wanted to use methods that were
[SPEAKER_01]: easily replicable by other states because
the issues that are faced by New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State are faced by other states as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that whatever is done here
could be exported to those states
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is this assessment different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I should say that these,
the idea of a statewide assessment has
[SPEAKER_01]: been contemplated elsewhere as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has periodically sent
questionnaires out to urban foresters and
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten feedback from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State would like to do
something like this, but they cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: funding for it, so they didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some studies as well as Indiana
and South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what they don't do is they don't
basically construct a statistically valid
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that model is not, and their data
isn't necessarily based on street tree
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't identify how I incorporate
geographical differences into their
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they certainly don't use GIS in their
analysis and statistical estimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, essentially what I had to work with
and had to collect was data from these
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got data from 138 municipalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I subdivided New York City where you have
five boroughs and each borough is a county
[SPEAKER_01]: into its different boroughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had 142 data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data that we collect, that is
collected in street tree inventories is
[SPEAKER_01]: species, diameter, which is a proxy for
the age of the tree, tree diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's very important is the
planting site type, whether it's in a tree
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn or a front yard or a sidewalk pit,
or whether you have utility wires
[SPEAKER_01]: overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of this equation is that
most communities in New York State don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have street tree inventories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another issue which is actually as
important is the fact that the data that
[SPEAKER_01]: is collected is typically all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily standardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have maybe six or seven
different types of tree diameter type
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trick is to put it together,
to aggregate it as well as I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't always possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also not everybody collects tree
genus, tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll collect genus, but not species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of a, I wouldn't call it a
mess, but there's certainly some
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges involved in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing that was hypothesized early
on and which proved accurate was that the
[SPEAKER_01]: data, the, the, the United States USDA
plant-hardened zones, of which there are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually five, I aggregated number three
and number four, because in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Adirondacks there are not that many
populated communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that these zones were, had the most
explanatory power of any variable I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just getting into a
discussion of, of, of these plant-hardened
[SPEAKER_01]: zones is, is another topic unto itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly they've been they're going
to be updated next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do, then this will all have to
be redone, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I went with, the 1990
zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in GIS, I aggregated my data into
those respective zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll see as I go through what I
did is that means for variables of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these basically, so if I want to know,
these are the constructs I used to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: go to, to construct my analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I want to know the total number of
street trees per species or genus or the
[SPEAKER_01]: total benefits for all street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first have to know how many,
or I have to estimate how many street
[SPEAKER_01]: trees there are in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to figure that out or to add,
to, to create an estimate for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, the number of street trees
is going to be a function of street length
[SPEAKER_01]: and populated places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what do I mean by populated places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Populated places would be census places,
such as villages and cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also census blocks with a persons
per square mile of greater than 500
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the census desk threshold for
suburban versus rural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, these are streets that
we can expect to, to continue to retain
[SPEAKER_01]: street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had to figure out the length of
such streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you an idea, what we're
looking at is we're not looking for street
[SPEAKER_01]: trees on interstates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not looking for them in driveways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for them in residential
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for them in commercial
areas, such as those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do this in GIS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can differentiate between, between
types of streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for instance, here we have the outline
for the city of Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have in pink, what I would,
what I'm terming, streets expected to
[SPEAKER_01]: contain street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to interstates and driveways
and, and roads going through shopping
[SPEAKER_01]: malls and things like that, which are
mapped, but we don't want to include.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's also important to note that,
you know, we have villages outside here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have census blocks with greater than
500 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are all also included in the
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, I did this for all of New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that for all of New York
State, you basically find, so here we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, these are not all the streets in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the streets that I've
differentiated in GIS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each street has a length associated
with it, which you can sum the length of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I came up with a measure for all
this, all of these streets expected to
[SPEAKER_01]: contain street trees in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of approximately 83 million meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is an estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I aggregated that data,
those streets to their respective plant
[SPEAKER_01]: hardiness zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have four zones with a sum of street
length in each zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason this is important is
because the further south you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say if you go from, you,
you find an increasing number of streets
[SPEAKER_01]: in populated areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important because I used the
relative length, some length of streets in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State by, by zone to create
weights for, for most of my subsequent
[SPEAKER_01]: measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, when you get to
Westchester and New York City and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Suffolk and Nassau counties,
you have more street length associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with populated places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than for instance you would up in the
north country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my, here's my original
construct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I plug in my meters for New York
State, then I have to figure out what is
[SPEAKER_01]: my number of street trees per unit street
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the next thing I worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I said, I have 142 data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically did the same thing for all
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically here's the boundary of,
of a village, Lyman, New York in
[SPEAKER_01]: Livingston County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's an inventory, I know how
many street trees there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the length of the road is in
Lyman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can calculate a measure for street
trees per meter or street trees per mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is that this,
the mean, the group mean for this measure
[SPEAKER_01]: for four zones varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, it's statistically different
depending upon the zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, in zone seven,
you have a greater number of street trees
[SPEAKER_01]: per mile than you do in Lyman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I believe is zone six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So statewide, you weight the group mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come up with a weighted statewide mean
for this measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weighted statewide mean for this
measure is 0.500, and it goes on and on
[SPEAKER_01]: and on, street trees per meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take that measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I plug it back into my, my little
construct here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I come up with a number, an estimate
of over four million street trees in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's also a standard error of the
weighted statewide mean associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can create a, a 90% confidence
interval for how many trees are likely,
[SPEAKER_01]: street trees that are likely to be
throughout New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's, I've gotten this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll, okay, back to figuring out
the mean percentage of street trees or
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I have to figure out next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for each inventory where I can do
this, this is what a typical inventory
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the number of trees, we have the
percentage of a particular genus in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maple is heavily represented, which is not
unusual in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I take each inventory
percentage, I create a mean inventory
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage by zone, and then I take my
weights that you saw before, and I weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: I weight that to create a weighted
statewide percentage for each genera and
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at, these are the five most
prevalent street tree genera in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting that they seem,
in most cases, they vary geographically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see, for instance, that Acer,
Maple is much more, is, is less prevalent
[SPEAKER_01]: down in zone seven, which is Westchester,
Suffolk, Nassau County, New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, we see more prevalent,
plantings of Quercus, which is oak,
[SPEAKER_01]: plane tree, Pyrus, whereas Gladiaceae is
pretty evenly distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar street tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is kind of interesting how
Norway Maple spikes way up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, and it's also interesting to note
that the four most, four of the five most
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent species happen to be Maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we can see, you know,
sort of, difference, geographic difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in prevalence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I go through all the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I construct these, I come up with these
means, statewide means for, for each
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have confidence intervals, 90%
confidence intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the same thing for, for,
for genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it for species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, Acer platanoides,
Norway Maple is the most prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Street tree species in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I frequently, not frequently,
but I often get asked how many ash trees
[SPEAKER_01]: are in New York State, because
communities, the state wants to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of how many ash trees are potentially
vulnerable to the emerald ash borer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we take the number of, estimated
number of street trees and the statewide
[SPEAKER_01]: weighted mean, we can estimate that
there's a, there are 142,000 ash trees
[SPEAKER_01]: street trees in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a fairly big range here
as, as to what the number could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I, I have a feeling that if
I had more data, that number would go
[SPEAKER_01]: down, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of variability in the data,
and it's sort of reflected in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what I did for ash, I did for the most
prevalent genera, and so I estimated that
[SPEAKER_01]: there were about 1.8 million maples in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do the same thing for species,
and I estimated there are approximately
[SPEAKER_01]: 864,000 Norway maples in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's useful information to
know if you have to budget for planning
[SPEAKER_01]: statewide for ash removal, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also asked to look at the annual
street tree benefits provided on a
[SPEAKER_01]: statewide basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay, this number, we know how many,
there's an estimate for how many street
[SPEAKER_01]: trees there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know the mean benefits per
street tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as it happens, going back to Lima,
we can calculate this in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: with using this software, and it's just an
estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, the estimate was that each street
tree provides $132.68 per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's interesting is that this
number does not vary statewide,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is interesting because the density
of plantings varies statewide,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this number does not vary statewide,
so I didn't have to create a weighted
[SPEAKER_01]: statewide mean for this at all,
which was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you plug that in, you get,
kicks out a number of statewide annual
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits provided by street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's an estimate of approximately
$556 million, which is not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a 90% confidence
interval as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, because I went through a lot
of data and did a lot of summary
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics, we see other things going on
in the street tree population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things has to do with
species diversity and the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: species diversity, and these are two
different species diversity indices,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they both indicate that the further
south we go, the more species diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also find that species diversity is
greater for cities and for villages,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what that seems to be about is that
cities with greater financial resources
[SPEAKER_01]: typically are able to hire a city
forester, and the forester is
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable enough to know that species
diversity is an important consideration
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore plants accordingly,
and we see this reflected here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we also find is that it's not
sufficient statewide, and there's a 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: rule, for instance, that no one single
street tree genus should exceed 20% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population, and as we can see here,
the great majority of the municipalities
[SPEAKER_01]: for which I have data exceed the 20% rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of these have percentages of
maple between 70 and 80%, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinarily high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottom line, too many maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at this graph of tree
diameter, what we find is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we would like to have more,
we would like to have, in the zero to six
[SPEAKER_01]: inch range, we'd like to have more street
trees in this range here to compensate for
[SPEAKER_01]: the mortality of both young and old trees,
and we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, the fact that this bar is right
here suggests strongly that we don't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not been enough planting of new
trees recently, which is going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term effect on the number of trees on
the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also looked at, sort of compared the
species composition for trees in the zero
[SPEAKER_01]: to six inch range to all the composition
in all trees, and what you basically find
[SPEAKER_01]: is that, well, this part's sort of good
because you basically are, it's basically
[SPEAKER_01]: suggesting that as a percentage of the
population, fewer maples are being
[SPEAKER_01]: planted, but what you also see is that
we're having large numbers, large
[SPEAKER_01]: increases in, in pears and in crab apples,
things like that, which is going to lead
[SPEAKER_01]: to a structural change in the street tree
population over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of borne out by this
graph, which says that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: larger and medium sized trees are being
planted less often than smaller sized
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's very interesting, is that this has
nothing, this has power companies such as
[SPEAKER_01]: NYSEG and National Grid have made a big
effort recently, in recent years,
[SPEAKER_01]: to suggest, and rightly so, that smaller
sized trees should be planted under single
[SPEAKER_01]: and triple phase utility wires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you look at whether utility
wires are present or not, what you see is
[SPEAKER_01]: that irrespective of utility wires,
that the, that more, there is a trend
[SPEAKER_01]: toward planting more smaller sized trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no graph to illustrate it
here, but it's true as well with respect
[SPEAKER_01]: to planting volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at planting sites such as
somebody's front lawn or yard where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no, essentially no restriction on
planting volume, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly smaller sized trees are being
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planted there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I hypothesized and found that the
most explanatory power for the data I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: had to do with plant hardiness in my
plant, in the 1990 USDA plant hardiness
[SPEAKER_01]: zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that isn't to say that there aren't
other correlations with street tree data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medium household income, annual
precipitation, and type of municipality,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a city, a village,
or, or a census designated place does have
[SPEAKER_01]: a correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found was that number one,
plant hardiness zone had by far the most
[SPEAKER_01]: explanatory value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that these variables were,
were multicollinear with, with this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I couldn't really use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tossed it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that doesn't mean that if we went to
another state, for instance, we went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state, it could be that annual
precipitation would be more significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in New York state, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was asked by the DEC to take my
initial findings and then go out and do
[SPEAKER_01]: some additional inventories and see how
those, the data from those inventories
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to my initial findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did five villages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortsville and Lima are in zone six.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had one, at least one from each
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did intensive, you know,
street tree inventories on foot for each
[SPEAKER_01]: of these five.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all villages.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found is that, you know,
is the data exactly the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically you see very similar trends
between how many, how many trees per unit
[SPEAKER_01]: street length are planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as you go further south,
you get more trees planted per unit street
[SPEAKER_01]: length.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fewer maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we get down to when I went to Great
Neck Plaza, which is Nassau County,
[SPEAKER_01]: fewer maples were planted, which is what I
would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, more oaks were planted,
higher percentage of oaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nori maples, you know, you see that spike
up here and then goes down when you get to
[SPEAKER_01]: further south.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with the London Plain Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, they're not exactly the
same, but I think they're reflective of
[SPEAKER_01]: the overall trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the tree trie diameter
profiles for the five villages I went to,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not enough trees in this
particular zero to six inch category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I concluded that, you know,
I was on the right track.
[SPEAKER_01]: That what I did seems to be fairly
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my test inventory statistics don't
completely agree with my zone class level
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics, but they seem to reflect the
overall trend that I found in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what's important to know,
and it can't be emphasized enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: is these Great Neck Plaza and Kensington
are contiguous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put one foot in Great Neck Plaza
and one foot in Kensington.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their street tree populations are
quite different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're somewhat different in their
planting types.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, all the trees in Kensington
are planted not in the tree lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the front lawn here, which is part
of the right of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of variability from one
municipality to the next, irrespective of
[SPEAKER_01]: geographic difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, conclusions from all this analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One conclusion is that we need more
species diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more diversity of both the species
and genus level for street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like the maple that ate all
the other species here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was Hope Plaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was American Elm and the American Elm
all died because of the Dutch Elm disease
[SPEAKER_01]: and had to be replanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Worcester Mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe these are all Norway maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Asian Longhorn Beetle really likes
maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an infestation of Asian Longhorn
Beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to cut all the trees down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had more species diversity,
there would be less... Even if you had the
[SPEAKER_01]: Asian Longhorn Beetle, hopefully your
street wouldn't be reduced to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more planting of trees to at least
maintain the population at the current
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's very easy to sort of call for
500,000 new trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think New York State is going to
be funding 500,000 or 600,000 new street
[SPEAKER_01]: trees because you have to think about
mortality of your plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not going to happen anytime
soon, but that's something that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because larger sized trees provide more
ecosystem benefits, we emphasize where
[SPEAKER_01]: planting volume is adequate and you don't
have overhead wires to plant larger
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and medium sized growing trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really being done at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a trend towards planting smaller
sized trees for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at this data that was collected
by Ohio State where they compared the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth of Kritegas and Gladiaceae,
there's a tremendous difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of... In the size of the tree and
the leaf surface provided by the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sort of plug this into this forest
service program, basically the Kritegas,
[SPEAKER_01]: the honey locust, the Gladiaceae is
providing eight times, roughly eight times
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of benefits provided by the
Kritegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight times the amount of storm water
mitigation provided by the Gladiaceae as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to the Kritegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on is that we're basically...
[SPEAKER_01]: We're programming a reduction in ecosystem
benefits provided by street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Street trees are roughly 10 to 20% of the
urban forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an insignificant component.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forest service has spent a lot of time
and a lot of energy trying to get out the
[SPEAKER_01]: message that street tree benefits are
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question that needs to be asked is,
is this message being heard?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, how can the message be retooled so
it is heard?
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I was asked to use methods
that could be replicated by other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did, this assessment depends on
having enough street tree inventory data
[SPEAKER_01]: that's broadly distributed throughout a
state, which is not so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State has a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also here at Cornell, through the SWAP
program, we've generated a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to say whether other states
have enough data that could be used to
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate what was done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's probably not as
obvious is that you need data about
[SPEAKER_01]: streets because we need to have...
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to use GIS to go through the
street data to do what was done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And presumably we can do that through
departments of transportation in those
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, the other thing to consider is
that, you know, in New York State,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant hardiness zone was the best
predictor variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not as I mentioned before,
it's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_01]: May not necessarily be true in other
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to try it in another state and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to acknowledge my
committee, Nina Bassick, Peter Trowbridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Joe Francis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been extremely helpful and I
appreciate their wisdom throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great to have advisors who are
older than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: for providing funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to thank the municipalities
and urban forestry companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals who had the data and who
provided it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be remiss if I didn't thank the
Cornell Student Weekend Arborist Team,
[SPEAKER_01]: who not only collected a lot of the data
during the fall, but helped me over a
[SPEAKER_01]: summer or two collecting data as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank the Departments of
Horticulture and Landscape Architecture
[SPEAKER_01]: for putting up with me for all these
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I'd like to thank my wife,
Diana, and my kids, who have also put up
[SPEAKER_01]: with me for a lot of years as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be happy to answer any questions you
might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that clear, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you, did you look at things on
a finer scale or was it too difficult?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of some examples could be
like street use type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have divided it into residential
in each of the zones versus commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: versus intensive residential or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely did look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is exactly the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is taking data at that scale
and extrapolating upwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partly because not everybody collects data
at that scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data that you're talking about has
to be geo-referenced, meaning it has to,
[SPEAKER_01]: each tree has to have an X and Y
coordinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to know exactly where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody collects that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody collects street address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it has to be correlated with
measures such as land use and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, which may be accurate, may not be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another scale issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this in this analysis, at this
level, at this time, I did do what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, but I wasn't comfortable
drawing too many conclusions from what I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually analyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a reduced amount of data at the
level that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at both geographic
variability and differences in land use
[SPEAKER_01]: and other variables, it's sort of running
out of room in terms of the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we, our SWAT inventories had,
were geo-referenced, but most inventories
[SPEAKER_04]: don't take GPS coordinates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of them, yeah, most,
they do, but it's very uneven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the right question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question and something I
struggle with all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not everybody collects the
same data in the same way at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's frustrating because when you
extrapolate to the statewide level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sort of not answering a lot of
questions, but those are the only
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the questions I felt comfortable
answering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a question in Geneva.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Alan Lacksoe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question and a comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the iTree model of forest service
development, does that take into account
[SPEAKER_05]: the difference in ecosystem services that
you get with an isolated tree versus
[SPEAKER_05]: similar tree in a forest?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because an isolated tree will intercept
lateral light and you get quite different
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those programs, the iTree programs
that I use are specifically targeted on to
[SPEAKER_01]: street trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have another program that looks at
forest stands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this time was individual trees,
but forest service also does it on a stand
[SPEAKER_04]: basis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just to comment, for vineyards,
we've worked with Art Gigatano in the
[SPEAKER_05]: climate center and he's generated a much
more high resolution temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: climatology at the three by three mile
scale and it's available to potentially be
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot more high resolution than those.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that and Oregon State has a
prism model and they have 30 year normals
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff and I started off using
that and it actually, I don't think it
[SPEAKER_01]: works as well for what I was doing for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also not as widely available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy to use and so that's how
I started off working with temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: hardiness and I wound up going back to
the, or wound up going to the USDA zones
[SPEAKER_01]: as cumbersome and as clumsy and as out of
date as they may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be very interested to see the updated
zones and see how that affects this type
[SPEAKER_01]: of analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think prism isn't very useful because
they give you averages.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one we can, Art can tell you what
percentage of the winters fell below
[SPEAKER_05]: specific temperatures at a five by five
kilometer grid scale for the whole state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may want to look into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can send you more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a little more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a comment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin Gopinay, I'm on the city of
Geneva's shaping committee and I'd like to
[SPEAKER_06]: comment on the statement you made about
large species no longer being involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I guess we've cut our own arm off in
that we do have more access to urban
[SPEAKER_06]: foresters and so on that advise us and
we're no longer even planting a large
[SPEAKER_06]: species anywhere under a wire.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right away we're doing away half of the
street trees on any one street because
[SPEAKER_06]: they're on one side of the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to be stuck with large
trees on one side and small medium trees
[SPEAKER_06]: on the other side which I suppose it's
diverse but it's not a very pleasing look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well one thing we might want to think
about is on the side of this street with
[SPEAKER_01]: the wires not planting in the tree lawn
and maybe we plant in the front yard or
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn of the parcel and then you could
potentially plant a larger size tree and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have the displeasing aesthetic which
is what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well I just think it's something that we
could consider moving forward that the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional model of planting trees and
tree lawns along the street maybe we could
[SPEAKER_01]: rethink that a little bit.
That's all.
Do
[SPEAKER_01]: utility companies exaggerate the problem
of trees under wires?
[SPEAKER_04]: We should ask the people of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just heard an NPR this morning that
there's a call to not plant trees near
[SPEAKER_04]: wires at all in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: People still don't have power there after
the week of the snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean there are different types of
wires and I think what Greg talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: is single and triple phase which are the
tall ones and there's cable and thick
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are cable and power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiber optics and they're not the ones that
we're concerned about as much as the high
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Single and triple phase that is a fire
hazard because they're not well insulated
[SPEAKER_04]: and then there's also potential for
stopping power if the trees come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a valid thing to plant trees
that mature at a height of 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where those wires are above 30 feet
versus having to plant really small trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where you don't have the height
between triple phase and the single phase,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can plant big trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's back to typical what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you plant big trees if you just have
cable and fiber optics which are those
[SPEAKER_04]: thick wires?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll plant right through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a level of saturation with how
many trees are feasible to even have per
[SPEAKER_02]: mile of diameter of street?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also can you correlate your tree
diameter size with how old the street is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering, you say we don't have
big or small trees to take the place of
[SPEAKER_02]: the older trees, but we have a point of
saturation with some of the oldest trees
[SPEAKER_02]: that already have too dense of a
saturation of trees to allow the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: trees even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you probably know more about this
than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can't plant a tree every
five feet, but you can definitely plan for
[SPEAKER_01]: a newer tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have great big old sugar maples,
let's say, and younger trees getting
[SPEAKER_01]: planted between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking ahead, they will remove the older,
possibly diseased, structurally deficient
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar maple and allow the younger tree to
get established and then remove the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: How on center?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the distance on center?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of a question being
discussed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Syracuse is what is the proper
distance between tree plantings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better to have a greater distance or
a smaller distance?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, that's kind of what the
Forest Service has been interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just plant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to say, yeah, we'll plant a
million trees in New York City,
[SPEAKER_01]: but where?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I answered your question,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_01]: The younger, the smaller trees is
something they've seen in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've seen it in many different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been and it's not unique to New York
City, New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can speculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to some extent it's a function of
departments of public works that usually
[SPEAKER_01]: typically maintain and plant the trees,
consider those smaller trees to be easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're more inclined to plant
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be true in the short term.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not necessarily true in the long
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at reduced maintenance
costs, which is a big concern of theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's possibly also,
and I thought about maybe there's just how
[SPEAKER_01]: we think of the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're no longer such a pedestrian
oriented society.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of a drive through society and
maybe that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't look for the same thing from
trees that we now that we used to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's it's not it's not unique to New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it this trend of smaller, smaller sized
plantings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Tom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fred, did you come up with a number for
the trees that could be planted?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real scale issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we don't have it for the other
places on a statewide basis.
That's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, well, thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
