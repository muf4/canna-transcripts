[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Laurie said, my lab works on these
thermally dimorphic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all pathogens of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike many fungi that cause disease
in people, they're all primary pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that they can infect healthy
individuals as well as immunocompromised
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what drew me to these organisms is
that they all have the very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to sense temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they distinguish whether
they're growing in the soil, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of their natural habitat, or whether
they're inside a mammalian host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this slide, you can see these two
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are both histoplasma capsulatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the organisms that we
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it grows in the soil,
it grows in a, one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see if I can make the pointer
not go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows in a filamentous form,
so long chains of cells, or hyphae,
[SPEAKER_00]: for those familiar with the fungal
lexicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this form also produces vegetative
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then when the soil is disrupted,
fragments of these filaments and the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores get aerosolized, and they can get
inhaled by mammals, including humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside the host, these cells will
transition to a budding yeast form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a more unicellular form of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that form, in the case of histoplasma,
goes on to colonize innate immune cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: so specifically macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my lab, we study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since temperature is a major signal
that triggers this switch between the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: form and the host form, we study how the
cells sense temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we can recapitulate
this transition in the laboratory simply
[SPEAKER_00]: by switching the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it a little bit easier to
study, although these are somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also look at, in addition to
temperature sensing, we look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between these fungi and innate
immune cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I'm going to focus mostly on
the temperature regulation of morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you a little bit about
virulence as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the main organisms,
the thermally dimorphic fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are primary pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So histoplasma is up there at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you today some
histoplasma biology and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: coccidioides, the third one down,
which is one of the thermal dimorphs that
[SPEAKER_00]: we more recently started studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we embarked on this field,
for all of these organisms, it was clear
[SPEAKER_00]: that they sense temperature and that that
affects their development, either in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil form on the left or the host form on
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for none of them did we understand
what the pathways are that allow the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: to sense temperature and then adopt the
appropriate morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just tell you, within the US,
these are the areas where these fungi are
[SPEAKER_00]: endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So histoplasma is mostly in the Ohio and
Mississippi River valleys down into Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coccidioides is a southwestern US
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So California, Arizona, it's spreading
northwards into Oregon and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also Mexico, Central
America, South America.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love this slide because it's
an old one, but it kind of encapsulates
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this really interesting
temperature-dependent biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top, you can see what happens to
histoplasma spores at 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're starting with asexual spores
that histoplasma has generated,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've generated in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're allowing them to germinate
at two different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along the top, you can see that if you
germinate them at host temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 37 degrees Celsius, they'll happily
divide in the yeast form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll generate these unicellular
yeast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you germinate them at lower
temperatures, they'll make hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think that there must be some
molecule or set of molecules in the spore
[SPEAKER_00]: that, as it germinates, allow it to sense
what temperature it's at and then allow it
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out whether to generate cells
that grow as yeast or grow as hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these yeast cells, when they're
generated in the host, they are a pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: of macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a movie of histoplasma yeast cells
that are growing inside bone
[SPEAKER_00]: marrow-derived macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is that, and I know
maybe it's easier to see over there
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the lighting, but the
histoplasma cells are producing a secreted
[SPEAKER_00]: mCherry protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the histoplasma gets
phagocytosed by the macrophage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays within a membrane-bound
compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those red rings you see,
that's because the histoplasma,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it divides, the membrane also continues
to surround it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the secreted mCherry protein is
kind of ringing the host membrane that's
[SPEAKER_00]: around each fungal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see there's a pretty
dramatic cell death event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So histoplasma replicates within a human
or mouse, in this case, immune cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the macrophage, and then it will trigger
host cell lysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we study in the lab,
which I'm not gonna really talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: today, is that the fungus produces
secreted virulence factors, or effectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: that transit out of the fungus,
out of the phagosome, into the host
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosol, where they stimulate host cell
death pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an area of interest for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so getting back then to the
temperature question, how do cells sense
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to turn on both this change in
morphology and virulence factor expression
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coupled with growth in the yeast
form?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been studying this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, just comparing the
soil form and the host form, we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are robust gene expression changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a quarter of the genome,
the transcriptome, sorry, is remodeled
[SPEAKER_00]: during this temperature transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that some transcripts,
about 1% of the transcripts, have an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative transcript start site,
depending on whether the cells are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hyphal form or the yeast form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some evidence for
translational regulation, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these two different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature then results in this change
in cell shape and gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows the fungus to be primed to
then colonize the host and cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we imagine that there are some
molecules in the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them molecular thermometers,
just borrowing a term from the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think that, for example,
a molecular thermometer is a molecule that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes its conformation in response to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are even some examples of DNA
sensing temperature changes, changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: topology of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that conformational change,
which could be intrinsic to the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, would then prompt the cells
to turn on signaling pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: determine growth in either the yeast or
the hyphal form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like, I guess, the bottom of
my slides are going to get cut off a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully there's not too much
information that we're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the holy grail for us has been
trying to identify what these temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you in this first
part of the talk how we are approaching
[SPEAKER_00]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of years ago now, we did a
screen for genes that are required for
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast phase growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just simply reasoning there's some
pathway downstream of temperature that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to result in the ability for
histoplasma cells to grow in the yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have mutants that are deficient
in that pathway, we will then get mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are unable to grow as yeast,
and instead they will be constitutively
[SPEAKER_00]: filamentous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that mutant screen, we
identified a number of genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: required for yeast phase growth,
or we call them RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild type cells will grow in the yeast
form at 37 degrees, the filamentous form
[SPEAKER_00]: at room temperature, just as I've told
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these mutants are constitutively
filamentous, so independent of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always grow as hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these mutants turns out to be
deficient in a different transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all four of these transcription factors
are required for yeast phase growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are all conserved fungal
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these transcription factors are each
upregulated in response to 37 degrees or a
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature, either at the transcript
level or the protein level or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each is required for the normal
transcriptional program, which you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild type cells, as I told you,
grow as yeast at 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try the pointer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild type cells grow at 37 degrees,
and then filaments at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just look at this first column,
so here this is just a heat map of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional data, where each row is a
different gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare wild type cells growing
at 37 degrees to room temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that there's a set of
transcripts that's normally upregulated at
[SPEAKER_00]: 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a set of transcripts that's
normally upregulated at room temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: when the cells are growing as filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in each of these RIP mutants,
if you compare their gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: profile at 37 degrees to wild type cells
growing at 37 degrees, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: they fail to upregulate that set of
transcripts that's normally associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with high temperature growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, they inappropriately
accumulate transcripts that are normally
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the hyphal form at room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of them is a master regulator of
yeast phase growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly to us, when we first
defined them, and we looked at their
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional targets, we could see that
they regulate genes that are required for
[SPEAKER_00]: both cell shape as well as virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are the first molecular handle
between temperature and these downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes of changing the cell shape and
turning on virulence genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work is all published.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically defined the network of these
RIP transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that they all regulate,
well, RIP 1, 2, and 4 regulate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all regulate each other either
directly as indicated by the solid lines
[SPEAKER_00]: or indirectly as regulated by the dashed
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of the reasons each of
these four transcription factors is
[SPEAKER_00]: required is that when you take out any one
of the four you're basically taking out
[SPEAKER_00]: all four because they regulate each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defined a motif for RIP 1 that we call
here motif A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we biochemically found that RIP 2 and
RIP 3, which are part of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor family, make a
heterodimer and together bind a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: motif, motif B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of the genes that are
required for cells to become a yeast cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeast phase specific genes or YPS
genes, there are all kinds of combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: of different motifs that stimulate the
expression of those genes in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having defined these networks,
what was really useful for us was that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the downstream genes were
important candidates for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all sort of effectors of unknown
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been exploring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm going to focus on more today
is this question of what turns on this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway in response to temperature,
thinking upstream of the RIP genes and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to then quickly summarize that and
set up the next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've told you that these four
transcription factors form a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They regulate each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They regulate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're required for the normal
morphologic response and molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: response to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'd like to understand then what is
it about the higher temperature that
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates these important transcription
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to set that up, I'll just tell you
one of the things we've looked at in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past is comparing steady state yeast cells
grown at 37 degrees to steady state
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't tell you this, but this is not a
fast transition for these cells
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slow growing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start out with yeast cells growing
at 37 degrees and you shift the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature down to room temperature,
it takes several days to make hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the steady state
populations and you look by Western at the
[SPEAKER_00]: RIP proteins, what you see is that the RIP
proteins accumulate to much higher levels
[SPEAKER_00]: in steady state yeast as opposed to
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just not around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In steady state hyphae at room temperature
to very high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, one of the things that
we continue to explore is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational efficiency of the RIP1 and
RIP2 transcripts seems to be temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like at 37 degrees,
you facilitate the translation of RIP1
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at room temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the opposite of facility,
you sort of down regulate the ability of
[SPEAKER_00]: that RIP2 transcript to be translated at
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a very interesting area of
potential temperature regulation that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also told you that there's differential
transcript start sites for some subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts, including RIP2 actually at
the two temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now one thing that Marat
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalam, a postdoc in the lab, is exploring
is just looking globally genome wide at
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA shape at the two temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something we are continuing
to investigate how different RNA molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: might serve as molecular thermosensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next, so that's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next set of experiments I want to
tell you is based on the reasoning that if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something intrinsic about
temperature that is causing a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells, then we ought to be able to see
that not just by looking at these steady
[SPEAKER_00]: state, very different cells, yeast and
hyphae, but after acute temperature shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's intrinsic, then it shouldn't take
days to cause a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to understand two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what happens at intermediate
temperatures in the lab, which this has
[SPEAKER_00]: never been looked at in the literature,
and then what happens short term after you
[SPEAKER_00]: change the temperature from 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say one of the reasons this
very simple question of what happens at
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate temperatures hasn't been
looked at is because these organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: require biosafety level three containment
to work on because they can infect healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that a lot of the
fundamentals we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to understand whether 37
degree, that temperature was required to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain RIP transcription factor
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you shift the temperature down
acutely, what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Anna Morrison, who's a current
graduate student in the lab finishing up
[SPEAKER_00]: her PhD, looked at what happens early on
when you shift the temperature down both
[SPEAKER_00]: to room temperature and some of these
intermediate temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first morphologically, so starting out
with yeast cells at day zero, Anna,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain them at 37 degrees and then you
maintain the yeast morphology as you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you shift them to room temperature,
then you start to generate hyphal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at intermediate temperatures,
it turns out that you don't maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast form at 29 degrees Celsius or even
at 33 degrees Celsius, a four degree
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature shift down from 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need maintenance at 37 degrees
to keep the yeast form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Anna wanted to look at what
happened transcriptionally to cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she decided to look two hours after
the temperature shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just remind you, at two hours
after the temperature shift, all the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: look morphologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeast, it takes a number of days for
them to shift into the hyphal form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though they look morphologically
like yeast, the question was, what are
[SPEAKER_00]: they doing transcriptionally after this
two hour shift?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out to be the case that about
a quarter of the transcriptome changes
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly in expression level after a
two hour shift to lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what I'm showing you in
terms of what the yellow indicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these different columns are what
happens when you compare the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression profile of cells grown at 37
degrees with a two hour shift to a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, either 33, 29 or room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yellow, these are the genes that
are normally expressed in the yeast form
[SPEAKER_00]: at 37 degrees, but change in expression
when you shift the cells down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue are the ones that are
normally hyphal in their expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they turn on when you shift the cells
from 37 degrees to a lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just looking at these genes,
so this was very interesting because it
[SPEAKER_00]: told us, OK, even at an early stage when
the cells still look morphologically like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, transcriptionally they're very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cells already know they're no
longer maintained at 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these genes make sense to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, and this will be relevant
in a few slides, Hsp90, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known heat shock protein chaperone in
eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hsp90 is one of the genes that when you
shift the cells down from 37 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to turn off Hsp90 expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say here that that's very
appealing because the heat shock pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just think about the question of
how do cells sense temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat shock response is a highly conserved
response from across different kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's appealing to tie in the heat
shock response to how these organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: sense temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this kind of goes along with old
data in the lab where Sinan Behan,
[SPEAKER_00]: a former postdoc, showed that if you take
yeast cells grown at 37 degrees and you
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them with a chemical inhibitor of
Hsp70, you see filamentation of the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us that the eight, sorry,
I said Hsp70, I meant Hsp90.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Hsp90 pathway is required for
yeast phase growth and the cells will turn
[SPEAKER_00]: down expression of Hsp90 when you shift
them below 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, some of the other genes in this
cluster include other genes that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to morphology because if,
in this case, CpH1, if we knock it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells can't maintain yeast phase
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, some of the virulence
factors that are required for yeast phase
[SPEAKER_00]: biology are also regulated acutely by
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this effector in histoplasma is
required for macrophage lysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you that movie early on of
histoplasma yeast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lysing host macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that wild type cells,
wild type histoplasma cells, if you infect
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages, they'll trigger host cell
lysis, which we can measure by release of
[SPEAKER_00]: a macrophage molecule into the supernatant
lactate dehydrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't infect the macrophages,
you don't see lysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you mutate this virulence factor,
you also don't see lysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these effectors, their
expression is exquisite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're explicitly tied to growth at 37
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, some of the genes that turn
on when you shift the cells down from 37
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees include genes that we've shown are
sufficient to trigger filamentation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells if we inappropriately express them
at 37 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these temperature dependent regulons
make sense to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just thinking about then what I've told
you we know that transitioning histoplasma
[SPEAKER_00]: from 37 degrees to lower temperatures is
sufficient to disrupt yeast phase growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and transcriptional changes occur very
fast after transition to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, probably within 30 minutes
to an hour, though I've shown you the data
[SPEAKER_00]: for two hours after the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just notably for the next part of the
talk, these heat shock pathway genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the genes that are very sensitive
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you a Western blot of RIP
protein levels in steady state yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told you that there isn't much RIP
protein around at room temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: steady state growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about two hours or a day after the
shift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turns out that RIP proteins are
still quite abundant, these transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, when you shift down from 37
degrees at these short times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this change in transcription suggests
that even though the proteins are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: something is happening about their
activity when you shift down from 37
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Anna did some chromatin IP experiments
where she's essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: immunoprecipitating the DNA targets that
are bound by the RIP proteins either at 37
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees or two hours after shift,
concomitant with also probing the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional transcriptome by RNAseq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to show you all the
data, but what she's observed is that many
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin IP events or association events
of these RIP transcription factors at 37
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees are reduced or absent after shift
to 25 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us that RIP activity is
actually regulated by temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just RIP abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that data, which we're still
analyzing, Anna found a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: heat shock pathway signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had told you before that normally
RIP1, from our previous published data,
[SPEAKER_00]: associates with a particular motif,
and then RIP2 and RIP3 form a heterodimer
[SPEAKER_00]: and associate with the DNA at a different
motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from these data, what Anna found was
the surprising result that RIP2,
[SPEAKER_00]: shown here in green, so this is RIP2
chromatin IP at 37 degrees in green,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus two hours after a shift down to 25
degrees in black, that there were a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: associations for RIP2 that were actually
not at its normal DNA binding motif,
[SPEAKER_00]: but instead were at HSEs, or heat shock
elements, which are the DNA binding motifs
[SPEAKER_00]: that regulate expression of the heat shock
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to discover that at 37
degrees, RIP2 is associating at this
[SPEAKER_00]: different motif, a heat shock element,
and that that is dependent on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
