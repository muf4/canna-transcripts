[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really special seminar today and
I'm really happy to be hosting visitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wish we could have one plant
breeding seminar per visitor because the
[SPEAKER_01]: wealth of information and experience of
the people who are here for the next two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks I'll talk about is enormous,
but we don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to have a panel
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's going to get to share kind of
their experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to say that we're lucky that
everybody's here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: visas have been very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put together workshops taking a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciating the effort that went into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today with us, we have everybody will
introduce themselves, but I'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: briefly give names Sophia, Divage,
Evelyn, Luis and Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So together, I just want to set the scene
for why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you who came to Martina's talk
last week may have heard about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: She mentioned some collaborative work
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement
is a Feed the Future program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really work with National
Agriculture Research Institutes globally
[SPEAKER_01]: on tools, technologies and methods that
increase effectiveness and impact from
[SPEAKER_01]: crop breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the central map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many programs that we engage
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into the details,
but just point out four centers of
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nodes where a lot of the
research takes place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is CIFAMIS based with Nusari in
Uganda with collaborations in Kenya and
[SPEAKER_01]: Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is CISESA that's centered
in Malawi at Luwinar with collaborations
[SPEAKER_01]: in Tanzania and Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in West Africa, we have SIWA that's
centered in Senegal with collaborations in
[SPEAKER_01]: Nigeria and Burkina Faso.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, in the Caribbean and Central
America, we have CATCHA that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration with Keski University in
Haiti and INTA in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within all of those breeding programs
across multiple crops, there are social
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists doing work with the breeding
programs to really reorient, to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: their breeding is socially impactful and
considering different issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a group of us and we work under
what's called priority setting and
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-cutting issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross-cutting issues are gender equality,
youth inclusion, nutrition, resilience and
[SPEAKER_01]: inclusion more broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of, we're a group of social
scientists kind of working across those
[SPEAKER_01]: domains and we really generate knowledge,
but also tools and methods to help guide
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today you'll hear a little bit about
the experience, not only on this project,
[SPEAKER_01]: but beyond the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna start us off with
introductions and I'll just start directly
[SPEAKER_01]: from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna lean a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Khalil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm called Hamba Sophia from Uganda.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for the National Agriculture
Research Organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: The National Agriculture Organization has
a mandate of conducting research in
[SPEAKER_05]: Uganda, research on differing on crops,
livestock, fisheries, agroforestry,
[SPEAKER_05]: among others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm based at, we have 16 institutions
in the whole country and I'm based in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern side of Uganda where we work on
dry land crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as CIFIMS is concerned,
we are targeting, okay, the project is on
[SPEAKER_05]: finger millet and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two projects, I mean, these two
crops are under dry land crops in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I work as a socioeconomist and actually
my mandate is mainly to evaluate the
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies developed by breeders and we
work hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: This project, its main objective is to
accelerate development and release of
[SPEAKER_05]: finger millet and sorghum varieties of
which as a socioeconomist, I have to
[SPEAKER_05]: conduct some work on trade preference to
inform the breeders on which traits are
[SPEAKER_05]: preferred by farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to be here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to meet my colleagues who
are also working in cross-cutting and
[SPEAKER_05]: priority-setting teams.
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall share a lot and also share the
experiences from the different countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Belarmino Divash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for the National Agriculture
Research Institute, mainly on a legume,
[SPEAKER_00]: national legume crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the scope of this project,
we are working on Kaupe on cross-cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: and priority issues and I'm happy to be
here and share what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Evelyn Kompare.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I come from West Africa, Burkina Faso,
and I, by training, I did science,
[SPEAKER_06]: technology and innovation studies in
sociology and sociology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I teach social policy and I work for the
National Institute for Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_06]: Environment based in Burkina Faso.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what my colleague was saying,
we have like 10 different sections
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm in the central part, is the
biggest center in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also teach at the University of
Joseph Key Zervo in Burkina Faso.
[SPEAKER_06]: I teach action research and I also teach a
development sociology modules at the
[SPEAKER_06]: university.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at Inera, I work, I got a,
let's say, is a large team, but in the
[SPEAKER_06]: central part, we got part of the team
looking at cross-cutting related issue,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is mostly socioeconomic studies and
also gender related issue because
[SPEAKER_06]: socioeconomy is big and inside
socioeconomy, we have sometimes to look at
[SPEAKER_06]: disaggregated information based on gender
or based on age and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we work on so many aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inera got many departments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Among the department, we have the breeding
department, we have soil scientists,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have geography department, we have also
social scientists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I must say on breeding, we do breeding
in most of the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I would say rice and maize,
which are the main crops, which have
[SPEAKER_06]: received quite a lot of funds in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the case of Ilsi, the project,
we are collaborating with Cornell and my
[SPEAKER_06]: colleagues here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We focus on kaupi, which is the most
famous legume in Burkina.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be women crop and it turned out
to become a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So men are taking the lead.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have also millet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also groundnuts, part of these crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say that among these
crops, as a breeding, we also do breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: on vegetables and also like tomatoes,
onion, but this part is quite,
[SPEAKER_06]: for now is an ongoing work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And other vegetables and also the dry
crops are just named.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say they're neglected because
now they're coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of effort I've been doing by
funders and the research on this level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I should say I'm so pleased to be here
and sitting in front here to talk about my
[SPEAKER_06]: experience and also the experience as a
group in the project and as a researcher
[SPEAKER_06]: in West Africa, where agriculture is the
main source of revenue and also the main
[SPEAKER_06]: source of living everyday life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am glad to be here with my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am from Costa Rica in Central America,
a small country.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am part of CASIA, Central American
and Caribbean Growth Improvement.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a project that we made with Kiskaya
University.
[SPEAKER_09]: In IT, I am part of National Research of
Agriculture in Costa Rica that is part of
[SPEAKER_09]: Minister of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this project, in CASIA, we are working
in tree crops, in sorghum, in common bean
[SPEAKER_09]: that is part a very important part of our
food in Costa Rica and in sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of my job in this project,
like a socio-economic and agricultural
[SPEAKER_09]: economic, we are working on tree reserve
activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we are in a participative evaluation
with a method that we are working with,
[SPEAKER_09]: with ELSI, that is the tricot in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are making in a couple of months we
are going to make a fingerprinting for
[SPEAKER_09]: evaluate our common bean breeding program.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is part that my team is working
on now in this project.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Simon Amundi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I come from Kenya.
[SPEAKER_08]: I work for the organization called Kenya
Agricultural and Livestock Research
[SPEAKER_08]: Organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a researcher by profession.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a value chain specialist.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at KALRO, our mandate is to be able to
disseminate new innovations on crop
[SPEAKER_08]: improvement, livestock, natural resource
management and social science research.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to be a part of this eminent
team.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the project, which is supported by
ELSI, we are working on social inclusion
[SPEAKER_08]: for food security and incomes and
increasing the voice of marginalized
[SPEAKER_08]: farmers in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_08]: More about it in the next session.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, everyone, for
introducing yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And welcome again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have two sets of
questions and then open question and
[SPEAKER_01]: answer at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start with going to ask
three panelists to give examples where
[SPEAKER_01]: some of their work has been impactful in
informing the breeding program,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to give you an example of what this
looks like in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with Luis.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a simple example.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to give you a little context
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This project are very helpful for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to be very strategic because we
have we don't have enough time for a
[SPEAKER_09]: process.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have just we need our our process.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't take like six or eight years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this project is about three years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to be very smart and strategic
to to try to to to adopt the technology
[SPEAKER_09]: that ELSI provide us and try to to to got
the goals.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a six, five promising lines,
materials of common red beans.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these these six, these five lines come
from a breeding process that take like six
[SPEAKER_09]: years.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is starting in 2007.
[SPEAKER_09]: These lines was evaluating in a farmer
fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the and we are we just need a
validating process to release one variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: With Cassia, we we decide to change a
little bit the things to give some to
[SPEAKER_09]: change the methods with the with the plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that they made this this this this
validation in the past, they select some
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers that they trust.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: And.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk to to to the to the plant and tell
him that a change a little bit,
[SPEAKER_09]: the things and a random random randomize
the the sample.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And increase the sum to try to to to to
add to the to the to the selection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another a another context and other
farmers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant breeders, of course,
they have they favorite parity at this
[SPEAKER_09]: part of the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: A I'm going to tell you that the name is
that the safe 64.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the name of that that material.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have five.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they discard the right discard.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the top and the last one was the
safe 71.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we we we give this recommendation,
a small recommendation, a simple
[SPEAKER_09]: recommendation to these to these to these
colleagues just to prove we know some
[SPEAKER_09]: things about the context that the market
change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: We we started this before this this
recommendation, of course, because the
[SPEAKER_09]: state money is there is a lot of budget in
this in this process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had the collaboration, of course,
the other a student of P.S.D.
[SPEAKER_09]: of Cornell that is Sergio Puerto.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to do this information,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in this in this group, we realize that
we made the procedure we make that we use
[SPEAKER_09]: the tricot method.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a three added comparison of
technology at the end is a massive
[SPEAKER_09]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made this process in four hundred
fields in Costa Rica in that two region of
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial production.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end of this this process,
we we know that the favorite of the
[SPEAKER_09]: average favorite variety was the safe 71.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That.
[SPEAKER_09]: How to say that the difference between the
people with a plan, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We proved our hypothesis because the
market changed a little bit in Costa Rica
[SPEAKER_09]: and in the last 10 years because the
government.
[SPEAKER_09]: And.
[SPEAKER_09]: The government a.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the market and buy.
[SPEAKER_09]: A common bean for that a company of the of
the government, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a hospitals, schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they the government was part of an
important part of the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they change a little bit that
conditions in the past.
[SPEAKER_09]: The condition was the industry put his
opinion over the trade that the farmer
[SPEAKER_09]: select.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know this with a small quality
sessions.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know that and we we we received
this feedback.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, this is a.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a structural situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a how to say that there is not a
structural is more specific, specific
[SPEAKER_09]: situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it depends off the government,
but they give the this this process
[SPEAKER_09]: procedure give us a feedback to select not
one variety, not two varieties,
[SPEAKER_09]: one for the government and the other one
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is two important markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a in the that's our experience,
a small change, a decision.
[SPEAKER_09]: Randomize.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all what we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Change the situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I I got some information and this
new variety that we release in these
[SPEAKER_09]: years, we're expecting to react to to
release the other one.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this party that is for government,
they are starting very well.
[SPEAKER_09]: A like five thousand of.
[SPEAKER_09]: A.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot that the measure, the five five
thousand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I.
[SPEAKER_09]: The measure of no, it's a.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was thinking that that means like
five thousand hectares is planting this
[SPEAKER_09]: this is new a harvest season and for this
this new variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's our experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a small change that we that we
introduce in our process and make a
[SPEAKER_09]: difference in the results.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is my experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know if you understand very well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about my rough English.
[SPEAKER_09]: But but I am glad if I send you the right
message for our experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now in advance, my apologies about my
English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not good from the where I come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't speak English.
[SPEAKER_00]: So copy in Mozambique, most likely in
southern region is the widely grown crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: With with the time, a lot of research has
been conducted on that crop, which as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result, as well on the variety release,
as well as agronomic practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is related to those varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the adoption rate aid from the
varieties or the agro agronomic practice
[SPEAKER_00]: or packages is not as as desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many factors can explain that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them is most likely lack of
involvement within the disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, social part of the research as
well as the variety of development itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I won't say the breeding.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a study was conducted for evaluation
analysis on copy evaluation in Mozambique,
[SPEAKER_00]: so among various findings that were
generated from from that start.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that it's really
important that it does help to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To improve, I mean, I would say the
integration of the social aspects on the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding component was that as a result of
that study, it was possible to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: market segmentations according to the a
farmer's description and the traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest or desired traits from from or
prefer the threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to prefer the threat
from from the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to mention the market segmentations
that the they were identified from that
[SPEAKER_00]: study, one is for dry grain for
exportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's one of the market segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is also for food
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then the third one is more food
security related, which has to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: international for for international market
as well as local consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this this third one has comprised
in terms of a traits that the variety that
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to that market segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously the dual purpose on which is
possible to get used from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get to use of the pots,
either fresh pots and as well of a grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: a grain, dry grain for the international
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, information the breeding,
the copy breeding program now is working a
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on those three market segmentation
in such a way that the crossing blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been conducted are specifically
to respond to those to those market
[SPEAKER_00]: segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding program has.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for now, if you go to the breeding
team, they have got a crossing block with
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents identified to respond to the
market segmentation one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a crossing crossing block.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the parents and the materials that
have been developed just to respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: market segmentation two and for the third
market segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are specific traits for
each market segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for the.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was saying, for the market
segmentation three, that the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits is in terms of the duration is a
medium to short duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the traits has to be in terms of
seed color is important trait that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out from that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that is a brown seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, those are the varieties for
dual purpose on which the leaves can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as well as the as the.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the ports, the grain can be consumed
data fresh or dried when it reached for
[SPEAKER_00]: for the for the respond to the export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That summarized just to to bring in as an
example on how the the activities or the
[SPEAKER_00]: result from the socioeconomic has impacted
in directing the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary to from the past on which the
approach was not necessarily guided for
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific market segment, which as a
result of a a scientific basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call that way.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: As per now, we believe that that can be in
a strategy which can improve the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: of of take or or rate of adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also an experience, OK,
for the purpose of this project is is is
[SPEAKER_00]: being done with the copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is experience that the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our institute wants to do across other
value chain or other commodity as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the efforts resource properly
directed in order to to immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to the end user's needs or
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in short how what we can bring
in to to share on how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or social aspect or socioeconomic aspect,
if I can call that has impacted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: directed the breeding program and in
Mozambique specifically breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one aspect that also comes out is not
necessarily with the.
[SPEAKER_00]: So second, the interdisciplinary aspect as
has us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the lessons that you can
come out because there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplines which I believe the goal is
the same to have a product that better
[SPEAKER_00]: responds to the end user's demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to also share my experience
from Uganda and.
[SPEAKER_05]: For us from our breeding program,
actually I can say that this is now a
[SPEAKER_05]: positive that you have changed from top
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reading approach to demand driven reading
approach whereby we have to listen to our
[SPEAKER_05]: customers and these customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look we look at them through OK,
we follow the value chain at different.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at different nodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do producers want?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do processors want?
[SPEAKER_05]: Traders and consumers so that I think by
doing this we can succeed that at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of the day we shall come up with a product
which is really demanded and the adoption
[SPEAKER_05]: rate will go high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we have done?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, we have mapped all OK,
like the stakeholders along the value
[SPEAKER_05]: chain, the minute and southern value
chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get to know who are our customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they want?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which varieties are they interested in and
why?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we have all these answers
because we have already conducted the
[SPEAKER_05]: studies and we have the reports out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We conducted, we analyzed the data and.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came up with product profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the targeted product profiles for
the different market segments.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, for sorghum we have three
market segments which we are following and
[SPEAKER_05]: this one will have brewery industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the food industry and the
beverage, the soft drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same applies to finger millet
because the way finger millet is utilized
[SPEAKER_05]: is almost the same way sorghum is
utilized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the product profiles, we had to
discuss the product profiles with the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders to agree because there are some,
you see like there are some traits which
[SPEAKER_05]: are coming up strongly and yet breeders
say we can't breed for this, but farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: want them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to discuss and see what can we
do for such cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now after presenting this, actually we
have the final product profiles which we
[SPEAKER_05]: shared with breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: The breeders are using, they've already
used these product profiles, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: for finger millet to select because
actually for us, I thought at first that
[SPEAKER_05]: not until the product profile is out,
that's when the breeding exercise will
[SPEAKER_05]: begin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet these the breeders already have their
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you present this, then we just
select the varieties which are aligned to
[SPEAKER_05]: the traits which farmers or which the
different stakeholders need.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've already selected these
germplasm and we had to do a validation
[SPEAKER_05]: whereby if we say for example finger
millet and sorghum are grown in specific
[SPEAKER_05]: areas of Eastern, Northern and Western
Uganda.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see like in each region,
they have different traits which they
[SPEAKER_05]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you find that there are some traits
which cut across the regions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what we did, we selected depending on
the product profiles, the germplasm and
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluated them with the farmers still.
[SPEAKER_05]: This time we didn't involve other
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't involved other stakeholders but
we have evaluated with farmers and
[SPEAKER_05]: sincerely what farmers, for them they are
actually, how can I bring it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like their choices don't keep changing
because we all know that the choices are
[SPEAKER_05]: dynamic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the consumers tell you today we
need these, tomorrow they need another
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time round after validation,
really it came out that they are
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent in their choice selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what's now we have to do is to
take out these varieties to the farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: and other stakeholders like the consumers
and the processors.
[SPEAKER_05]: The interesting bit, as I said that
breeders sometimes they also have their
[SPEAKER_05]: goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their objectives, why they are
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this time around, during the
discussion, a breeder will tell you,
[SPEAKER_05]: yes, you are telling me that color is very
important or there is a trait of is too
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh, especially for finger millet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know like finger millet in Uganda,
we call it a women's crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because men don't like to do it,
to cultivate finger millet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say it's really hard, it has a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like when it comes to activities like
weeding, men don't like bending,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's over bending.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say for them their backs pain,
the women at least for them they can do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some traits which you think
they're not very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when farmers are selecting these
varieties, they really say we want a
[SPEAKER_05]: variety, maybe which tillers for reasons
that it will increase the production as
[SPEAKER_05]: well as also reduce on the work of over
weeding like two, three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it suppresses the weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of these traits and then breeders
say, but these are not important traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you are saying they are not
important, but farmers will not adopt
[SPEAKER_05]: those varieties which you think are very
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I've realized that we have to
listen to our customers if your target is
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe to breed for the brewery company or
you are breeding for food, can you listen
[SPEAKER_05]: to the customer who says I want a variety
which tastes like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you don't, they will not
adopt these varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also realized during the survey,
that the variety, the improved varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: out there are not known.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, sometimes you find that they are
already with farmers, but in the case Hali
[SPEAKER_05]: takes a variety somewhere, they will call
it Hali.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will not call it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are not aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone is like, you mean we have improved
variety, so they are not aware that our
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to do a lot of awareness to
these farmers so that I think they can,
[SPEAKER_05]: the demand can increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this I think affects the seed system
if we don't do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think another thing which I wanted to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much to hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure we hear from Eveline
and Simon too because we're running a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit low on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to Eveline and Simon, they're really
deeply involved in social inclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: related works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to see why is social
inclusion important to your work and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you could talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the floor, I just want,
before I start to set a bit the scene,
[SPEAKER_06]: I started with Inira is almost now 11
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I started and I went to two workshops
and when I finish, people will joke with
[SPEAKER_06]: you, have you found what you are
searching?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, I'm a researcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you found what you are searching?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look at the person and I don't know
what to answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing they would continue and
say, oh, like Sankara was saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: researcher who are searching, we got them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The researcher who are finding,
we are still searching for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the world where I am putting my
foot in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a kind of thing that we had
challenged as it was 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a big challenge because we had a
lot of varieties piled in the shelves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they don't go out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had like two or three stories,
but this was definitely real stories
[SPEAKER_06]: because at the beginning we're like,
yeah, you close yourself in the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: You work hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You come up with a variety because you
think that my community is dying from
[SPEAKER_06]: hunger.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I got a variety, which can produce a
double of this, because usually it's half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if it is full, they're going to be
happy and eat well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end of the day, you get the
variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will go there for one year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next year, you go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone is just doing like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they will take it for respect because
you bring it to them, but they will never
[SPEAKER_06]: see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it ended up being cooked.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if not cooked, it will be probably sent
to the market or given to because it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: what they're expecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I think this was quite lessons
that breeding team has learned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, and they realized that when I
enter, I think I had one colleague who was
[SPEAKER_06]: a sociologist and another two in the
center I was who were economists and the
[SPEAKER_06]: other were doing their PhDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, it was like two worlds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone is in the corner, trying to do
whatever they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll call that is very urgent,
that instead of waiting to fail,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you call you, please come,
you did sociology, come, come and help me
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand what is going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you go, you do the survey.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say, oh, I mean, we don't like this
crop because it's too short.
[SPEAKER_06]: The height is not what we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we need a market.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to build a market for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they will go, they will build the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one is sitting in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because they turn the shops toward
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the culture, if the shop is toward
this end, it means that you are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: collapse.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nobody is going to use this market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was definitely a big time that
things are done in a very inclusive way
[SPEAKER_06]: from the beginning, which means we should
not leave anyone outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to tell my colleagues that it's
like the body, if you got your little
[SPEAKER_06]: finger with a wound, you will stay home
for one month.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say, why are you sick?
[SPEAKER_06]: You say, use your finger, this little
finger, but it will collapse the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was what was trying to go on in
era.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a right time that all or most of
the, I mean, most of the projects try to
[SPEAKER_06]: be inclusive in the team first and then
inclusive from the research perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this inclusivity has called us that
when you go for research, the community is
[SPEAKER_06]: such complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like she was saying, you know,
even in Burkina, if you go to the north
[SPEAKER_06]: side, you get findings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't expect that you will find the same
thing from the south.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it means that you need to have a
representative sample in all the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the variety has to be used for
different communities or alternatively is
[SPEAKER_06]: you focus on one community and you need to
be the most inclusive possible,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is first the value chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So usually we are focusing on farmers,
processors, traders, and because farmers
[SPEAKER_06]: are at the same time consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and in the farming perspective,
you have to be inclusive because the point
[SPEAKER_06]: of view of the woman who is cooking to
appreciate is specific variety is
[SPEAKER_06]: different from the man who don't go next
to the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you see a man in the kitchen,
there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either he's so modernized or he's sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are, yeah, so it is not usual
that he's standing in the kitchen trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to cook and the millet is not getting
ready and he's struggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when a woman is talking to you about
the variety, she may go in details.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to go on board with the woman
to understand the challenge she's facing
[SPEAKER_06]: toward a specific crop, like millet or
cowpea or sorghum.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also you need to have the view of the
man because he's the head of the
[SPEAKER_06]: household.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I mean, we use not to interview
people who are younger than 14 because you
[SPEAKER_06]: see, or the founder will say that you are
doing child abuse, talking about the
[SPEAKER_06]: farms, but most of the time they are doing
the work behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having their point of view is very
crucial because most of that not only
[SPEAKER_06]: consuming, but also they are the
hardworking people with the moms in the
[SPEAKER_06]: farm without being seen properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the challenge sometimes, either a
challenge from harvesting or challenge
[SPEAKER_06]: from picking the crops or the color is
changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not on the farm, you cannot
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the inclusivity of the community in
looking at what are the preferences is
[SPEAKER_06]: very crucial.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure, it makes the work very long,
long process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in the end of the day,
you find yourself with a diversity of
[SPEAKER_06]: point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what we are trying to do in
Ineda, we have what you call the nice to
[SPEAKER_06]: have threats.
[SPEAKER_06]: They must have threats, which means in the
end of the whole process of collecting
[SPEAKER_06]: information in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes as well, sorry to say it,
because I consider also breeders as part
[SPEAKER_06]: of my participants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do interview with them without
telling them what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: As as information, but when you are
sharing back the question with them,
[SPEAKER_06]: they realize that some of these things are
coming from me, but it makes sense in the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing because they are completely
part of the work by being by working in
[SPEAKER_06]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very good to include them sometime
as participant in the in the survey.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having said so, and when we have the
must have threats, depending on the amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of money, because sometimes they cannot
breathe for everything, they will tell me,
[SPEAKER_06]: Evelyn, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, yes, me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to tell me one, two,
three things I need to put and breathe
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell him if if I tell you the
color, yellow color, is it enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: You say yes, but I say it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: The yellow you got in your mind may not be
the yellow the farmers is telling me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see how complex it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have light yellow in your mind and
you go and breathe light yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this farmer, perhaps their totem is
light yellow, the one that yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even by saying the color itself,
it's a big issue inside that you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: investigate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end of the day, when you have
we have we are able to have the massive
[SPEAKER_06]: threat we have all to go on the field and
be able to to validate the type of yellow,
[SPEAKER_06]: yellowness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it exists or the type of
redness or darkness so that we are all
[SPEAKER_06]: even if I don't call it yellow,
at least I know what it means.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is still visible when you talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is and they will tell you we won't
copy which tastes of like our local
[SPEAKER_06]: variety and look at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sitting collecting this data and I
am working in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this kind of copy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which tastes like the local variety?
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes I need to tell them,
can you bring me a handful of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: At least if I have a sample by talking
about which this I can show them this is
[SPEAKER_06]: it, which means they really need to even
taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least and these are some of the
information or the included strategy we
[SPEAKER_06]: are putting in place to be able to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say that there is no one
size fits all because every single a I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean, variety or every single community is
a very complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, community that you need to take if
in the end of the day, we want it to be
[SPEAKER_06]: successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no waste of time in lab work and
field work so that we all move in the same
[SPEAKER_06]: direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the last thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing for a little bit for the
question, if there is a question,
[SPEAKER_06]: I will add it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the project, we are working on social
inclusion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Social inclusion is one of the fundamental
international human rights for
[SPEAKER_08]: development, agricultural projects need to
for them to be inclusive.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to bring on board the women,
the youth and the other marginalized
[SPEAKER_08]: groups through a project supported by IC.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with these other
marginalized groups, and these are groups
[SPEAKER_08]: which have never been thought about.
[SPEAKER_08]: We call them forgotten farmers who who are
rarely targeted by development programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the widow farmers,
farmers who are widows.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the farmers who are
living with HIV AIDS.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the farmers living
with disability.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the farmers who are
single mothers under 35 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with the youth and we are
also working with the farmers who are
[SPEAKER_08]: caregivers of infants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, these groups even as in our research
program, in our research organization,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've never reached them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But through IC, we are now having a
project which we are calling Last Mile
[SPEAKER_08]: Connectivity so that we can be able to
reach these groups with innovations that
[SPEAKER_08]: come from breeders.
[SPEAKER_08]: The context of these groups is that they
live in marginalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: They live in poverty.
[SPEAKER_08]: They live in extreme poverty.
[SPEAKER_08]: They live in exclusion.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have never been able to use
innovations from breeders.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a baseline survey that we carried
out, we wanted to understand their
[SPEAKER_08]: situation and in order to improve their
livelihoods through the new innovations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are working through a stakeholder
platform that involves public and private
[SPEAKER_08]: sector actors in order to improve the
livelihoods of these groups using new
[SPEAKER_08]: innovations of high iron rich,
high iron and zinc rich beans.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bean is called Nyota bean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can Google, you will see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a high iron and zinc, which is
quite useful in terms of nutrition for the
[SPEAKER_08]: type of groups that I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other innovation is the finger millet,
which in that region in Kenya is very
[SPEAKER_08]: important for porridge as well as the
staple food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the final one is the sorghum.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these groups through support by IC,
we've been able to disseminate the three
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: These varieties, after carrying out a
rapid trade preferences, they wanted
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties which are climate resilient,
meaning they are drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are early maturing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in terms of beans, they are gentle to
the stomach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people don't like eating beans
because they have problems with the
[SPEAKER_08]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we selected this variety because it is
a flatlet free.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in terms of millet, the porridge
is very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is quite sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: The groups have already gone through the
first season.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've grown their varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we recently carried out a food
festival and it was very encouraging to
[SPEAKER_08]: see how products from breeders can be able
to transform the nutrition of these
[SPEAKER_08]: disadvantaged groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this food festival, we carried out with
the groups, farmers living with HIV and
[SPEAKER_08]: their children.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had a meal together of finger
millet porridge from the breeders,
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as the high zinc and iron rich
bean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And their feedback was that in terms of
the beans, this was the best bean that
[SPEAKER_08]: they have ever had before compared to the
local varieties and also in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: sorghum.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this goes to underscore the importance
of breeding programs when they
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriately target the market segments.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think that through this stakeholder
program, we are not only going to work on
[SPEAKER_08]: issues of food and nutritional security,
but also the issue of increasing the voice
[SPEAKER_08]: of these groups in a society.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because through their conditions,
one of the things that makes them
[SPEAKER_08]: discriminated is that they do not have a
platform to be able to increase their
[SPEAKER_08]: voice in society.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to say that breeding is
very important in feeding the future,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's only one part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_08]: The social scientists are very important
as well as the other stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we all work together in a world
that leaves no one behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're out of time, but I'd love to
take some questions until we get kicked
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is a class after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do have one question on the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe in the room, one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we start with the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question from Leah, for Sophie,
could you provide more information on the
[SPEAKER_02]: steps taken by NARO that ensure
socioeconomic aspects are considered in
[SPEAKER_02]: the pre-breeding and early breeding
programs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Within government-funded projects,
not donor-funded projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our government-funded project is a
socioeconomic study considered in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-breeding stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any steps, too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government-funded projects,
I would say yes and no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like in Uganda, the funding we get
from government for research is really
[SPEAKER_05]: limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most funding, we get it from donors.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as I said before, before we were
considering the top-down research
[SPEAKER_05]: approach, whereby if breeders get little
money, they have objectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like someone will say, I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to improve on yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not looking at other issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, for example, if you breed,
if you want to improve on yield of a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain variety, you are forgetting that
there are also other issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you take this variety,
which is high yielding, and maybe it is
[SPEAKER_05]: very tall, and you are taking it to areas,
for example, in the eastern region,
[SPEAKER_05]: they like medium height varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if it is high yielding,
because the women are the one cultivating,
[SPEAKER_05]: someone will say, ah, that variety,
I can't do it, harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning you have to maybe get men to hope
you and men actually will be enjoying
[SPEAKER_05]: their brew.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not bothered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a woman, you have to provide food at
home.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can say no when I follow that
argument.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can also say yes, because after working
with you, say, actually, things are
[SPEAKER_05]: changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that the approach is also changing,
which is demand-driven, whereby as social
[SPEAKER_05]: economists, now at least we have a voice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before, we used to work in silos.
[SPEAKER_05]: A breeder is working alone, and even
social economists, the agronomists,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you find that everything is mixed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, now we are working,
we are following the interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_05]: approach, whereby we come together and
discuss how to handle such issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there I can say that it is coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in case we get any government funding,
we still have to follow the demand-driven
[SPEAKER_05]: approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you please help me thank Gargan?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
