[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try and live up to that wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a little bit over-empowered by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I am a microbial ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started out my life as a marine
microbial ecologist and applying the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: of how bacteria communicate with each
other and with their environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they sense things, to understanding
how they do that in many other ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really amazing time to be a
microbial ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the few times in history
where people have actually taken us really
[SPEAKER_00]: deadly seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time was probably in the late
19th century when they found out bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: could kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they find out that bacteria can
make people healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really starting to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great is that the horticultural
world is starting to pay attention as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that the bacteria that
colonize plants and live on the outsides
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants and insides of plants actually
may be playing a role in the health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this isn't anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if anything, the agricultural
world has led the world of science in
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing and understanding how bacteria
play a role in the health of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't look at nitrogen fixation any
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been incredibly important for us
as researchers to understand how all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecological interactions that go on
inside the ecosystem, which is a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they play a role in the health and
productivity and development of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to do with plants and
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did found the Earth Microbiome Project
around five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an effort to catalog microbial
diversity in as many environments as we
[SPEAKER_00]: could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my colleagues Rob Knight and Janet
Jansen, we really tried to push this
[SPEAKER_00]: forward as an opportunity to look into
ecosystems and build out a repository to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us understand how many organisms
there were, their potential functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they were interacting with the
world around them on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as was famous for Chicago, we had no
small plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a very big undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very ambitious at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to ramp back our
ambitions as we found out quite how
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult it was to get people to share
their samples and share their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We initially thought, well, everybody will
want to have the microbiome sequenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, because the microbiome's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we quickly realized that people
were not necessarily as excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing all of their carbon data and all
the ancillary data that we thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: just ancillary data, which turned out to
be people's PhD theses and publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't quite as willing to share
that up front as we thought they would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to scale back our
ambitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to date, with over the 400
collaborators we have, we processed around
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 samples for 16S ribosomal RNA
sequencing, about half of those for 18S
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosomal sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a smattering of those for shotgun
metagenomics as we slowly burnt through
[SPEAKER_00]: our financial supplies and contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These represent over 50 large-scale
biomes, a biome being like open ocean or
[SPEAKER_00]: prairie soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's around 6 billion sequences in
this database, with a little over 27
[SPEAKER_00]: million bacterial tacks are identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data analysis is occurring in a
public forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this data is made publicly
available immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't actually published any of
the results of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people have been publishing it for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was talking to Terry on the way
from the airport, I was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we'd be quite happy if someone
wanted to take all this data and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: publish it, because it's a pain in the ass
to try and analyze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: People coming out have been utilizing some
of this data to try and understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: many species there might be on Earth and
to predict that number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are exciting studies coming out
that are utilizing this data to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeographic patterns, the pattern
associations with different climactic
[SPEAKER_00]: variables, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to talk a little bit about
how we've utilized some of these data and
[SPEAKER_00]: other studies in order to try and derive
some kind of large-scale ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the interactions between
plants and bacteria and over soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first ones we did as part of
the EMP was work with Rebecca McCully and
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiera on modeling utilizing microbial
community systems to model how bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities varied across a range of
prairie conditions in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collecting samples from relic tall
grass prairie sites meant creeping into
[SPEAKER_00]: basically graveyards in the dead of night
and taking soil cores and into disused
[SPEAKER_00]: railway lines, anywhere that hadn't really
been used for agricultural activity since
[SPEAKER_00]: around 1850.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this meant civil war graveyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically collected samples from those
because they were the least contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: by agricultural activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois has lost about 98 to 99 percent
of its prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, that's a remarkable
degradation of a natural biological
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and one that, you know,
we bitterly complain when other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: try and, you know, agriculturalize their
land in the destruction of the Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did to one of our primary
biological environments nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensively destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we utilized this information to look
at the microbial communities in different
[SPEAKER_00]: sites around this, from the extent of this
prairie system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we interpolated and extrapolated
beyond those points to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: climactic variables that exist now
correlate with the position of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes along with plant variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hindcast that back to around
1840 to when the prairie was complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the extent of the Midwest tall grass
plant prairie system had a distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By mapping our association between
climactic variables and plant distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, we were able to identify the
predicted relative abundances of organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: like the verruca microbial phylum across
that system and generate some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive understanding of the
distribution of that organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, verruca microbial are hard to
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire phylum has very few cultured
representatives in our databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flourish where carbon-nitrogen ratios
are very high because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily do so well when you have a lot
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good at carbon metabolism and
they're good at activating resources which
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used by certain types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when soils are turned over to
agriculture and you get an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, you see these things
disappearing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very interested in trying to
identify ways to restore these prairie
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw very well to go in and,
you know, rip out all of the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation and just plant a load of new
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's proven to be very effective in
certain systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also keen to say, well,
how can we create stable ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we rebuild carbon processes and
organic matter pools within these systems
[SPEAKER_00]: which support the autonomous preservation
of that environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we had to understand those
bacteria which were significantly related
[SPEAKER_00]: to that and, more importantly,
their functional diversity and their
[SPEAKER_00]: capability of supporting carbon and
nitrogen turnover in these environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may seem a little bit like,
oh, wow, they do time-traveling statistics
[SPEAKER_00]: to predict what things looked like 150
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoopee-doo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, yeah, it does look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not necessarily the be all and
end all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're really trying to do is capture
the system and understand how that system
[SPEAKER_00]: varies, understand what perturbs it,
what leads to its stability so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: try and recreate it, not just in our
computers, but in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so working with other researchers
around the Midwest and on the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're now trying to implement some of the
work that we've done here in small plots
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually build out new systems where
we have restored prairie sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also been working on this in a
different context, but across climactic
[SPEAKER_00]: gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is work we're doing with my
colleagues in National Chinese Academy of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to understand the
differentiation in forest ecosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: across a climactic gradient along the East
Coast of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in collaboration between our labs,
we took samples along this gradient,
[SPEAKER_00]: 110 soil samples from both natural
undisturbed forests across this gradient,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then basically analyzed the diversity
of archaea, bacteria, and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper is in submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a lot of data today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yet been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can feel free to peer review,
critique it as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've always been very upfront about
presenting the data that we are already
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to get feedback
from the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you can analyze it faster
than we can, then go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a lot of chronicleota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of aphrodibacteria,
no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of ascomycota, but we do see
amazing biogeographic variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can map and model that variance to
large-scale network patterns to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: strong correlative interaction space
between different kingdoms of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every dot here is a bacterial OTU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every green dot is a eukaryotic OTU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black lines are positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red interactions, you can't see
many of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I can't even see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at that close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some there, are negative color
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, just looks like a morass
of network information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by teasing apart the topology of these
networks, we can actually start to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how some climactic variables
can lead to differentiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: coassociation patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these connections are strong and
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only those with a spearmens of greater
than 0.7 are actually identified in this
[SPEAKER_00]: network structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each size of each node is proportional to
the relative months of the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 66,000 associations among
3,000 microbial OTUs, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, nearly 4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of these interactions are global.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 10 are region-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are inherent structures within
forest ecosystems across the eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: seaboard of China which are globally
distributed no matter what we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, suggesting that there's niche
specificity within a forest ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: irrespective of the climactic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the inherent variance in the system,
this 10% of these interactions which are
[SPEAKER_00]: region-specific, that's what yields
climatic range specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that climatic range specificity is
what's interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by understanding the variance
between regions, we can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what makes an ecosystem
important in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those organisms may be important
to the system ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this, if we look at how we
interpret that network topology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the connectivity of the network is
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get more connections, more significant
interactions between bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: archaea, and eukaryotes up in the northern
region compared to the southern region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get greater precipitation in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a semi-tropical environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that this greater
precipitation leads to decreased niche
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, you're getting more moisture
connectivity in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture connectivity allows microbes to
move out of their individual pockets and
[SPEAKER_00]: interact more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on a global scale, indirectly through
metabolite transfer and directly through
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a decrease in the specific
niche connectivity between organisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase in a broad scale
characterization of network space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lower precipitation in the north
induces a strong niche differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, organisms clustering down in
their little niches, disassociated from
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms which may be a millimeter
away on another organic mass matter
[SPEAKER_00]: particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that niche differentiation is a
globally attributable trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a study I'm not going to talk about in
detail, as you're not going to mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from right now when I am going to
mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hospital microbiome project,
in this study, we followed a hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, 10 patient rooms,
two nursing stations, for 365 consecutive
[SPEAKER_00]: days, cataloging all of the patients on
three body surfaces and all the staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the environments within the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some 50 different surfaces, including air
and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the bacterial community
structure across all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that people share more bacteria
between each other, including patients to
[SPEAKER_00]: staff and staff to patients and staff to
staff, when the environment has more
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, when bacteria have the
capability of surviving outside the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a definitive increase in sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting, and again,
I'm telling you unpublished data,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is currently in review.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see an increase in disease burden
in that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this increase in microbial sharing
isn't leading to an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital-acquired infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just distributing microbes on a
bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if anything, we see a small
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about what that means
until the cows come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moisture is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for increased activity and
movement of organisms between sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very tangential as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go off on a too weird a track,
does someone throw something at me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to get back onto what I was
talking about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so utilizing this information,
we can start to build out intercontinental
[SPEAKER_00]: and transcontinental understanding of
microbial community structure and what it
[SPEAKER_00]: means in a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Tibetan Plateau in North
America, collecting samples in transects
[SPEAKER_00]: and dotted samples around areas and
transects around the Tibetan Plateau
[SPEAKER_00]: across climactic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start to interpolate and build maps
of microbial community structure across
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems and link them into climactic
variables in an attempt to try and predict
[SPEAKER_00]: how these systems respond to
climate-changing environmental systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Tibetan Plateau starting in
1900.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now in 1925, 1930, with annual
averages in the shift in microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: community structure or beta diversity
across the whole system as we move across
[SPEAKER_00]: a century of climactic variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see in this pretty picture is a
significant change in the... Let me just
[SPEAKER_00]: play it again so you can see it while I'm
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a significant change in the community
fluctuation, in the differentiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community structure as parts of
the system become destabilized due to
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing temperatures, as parts of the
system become highly productive due to
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing carbon dioxide, and as
agricultural activity takes over in the
[SPEAKER_00]: latter part of the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know when it was in 1910?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I went back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a time traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you not watched Doctor Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hindcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have pretty good climactic
records back to 1910.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to 1910, they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were weather stations present in
parts of Tibet back then, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: first bought by the British and then later
by...
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the French and then the Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the system's been reasonably well
monitored, and we have good records for
[SPEAKER_00]: global climate variables at degrees of
resolution for pretty much the whole globe
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a certain level, mostly
interpolated from existing data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a model, so... Oh,
yeah, everything's a model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it agrees with your model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, damn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you prove me wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to predict what happened
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to understand, if anything,
what the relationship is between microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities' destability or stability
between years and climactic variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I can... Even within a
five-year grant, I can only get five years
[SPEAKER_00]: of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to try and predict outside the
bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can use this to make predictions
about what's happening now at a fine scale
[SPEAKER_00]: if you understand what the long-term
trends might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, this is just a pretty picture,
but underlying it is a fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical model which can help us to
extrapolate and predict beyond our
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in here, what's interesting is the
microbial community structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: present-day Tibet is best predicted... Oh,
I'm talking to you alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best predicted by the climactic variables
in between 1968 and 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the... which,
again, is a bit weird, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the climate in 1968,
1972, that is the climate which best
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates with what we observe in
current-day Tibet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is actually equally true for
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take that as a variable
predictive algorithm, it means that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: predict if nothing changed on Earth for
the next 30 years, taking today's climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can predict what we should see the
system stabilize to in about 30 years'
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that basis, this is obviously Tibet
and North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the current richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the next 30 years, if we believe
that climate has this relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: time and microbial community structure,
we'll see a significant shift in richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the systems have become an
increase in richness due to
[SPEAKER_00]: destabilization of community structure,
reduction in abundance of certain key
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whereas most of Tibet will show a
regionally homogeneous predictive
[SPEAKER_00]: capability, the North American coast will
show a highly heterogeneous response
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, majority will increase in
richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see the similarity between what
happens in northern Canada and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in this other basically
semi-arctic zone, they call Nepal the
[SPEAKER_00]: third pole on Earth, we see a similar
increase in richness due to a
[SPEAKER_00]: destabilization of the Adhafic variables
in the soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is highly linked to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we haven't done at all is use
plants in any of these calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to, but we don't have a lot
of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do see is a variance in the types
of bacteria that we find across these
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can correlate that to plant inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Tibet, we'll see an increase in
alpha-proto bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me qualify that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We predict if everything stays normal and
there's no inputs at all, that we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase in alpha-proto bacteria and a
decrease in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha-proto bacteria in both of these
systems, in these soil systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: show a significant correlation to
carbon-nitron ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we believe that this could
be linked into soil moisture and could be
[SPEAKER_00]: linked into a distribution in the change
in below-carbon inputs into this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by changing below-carbon inputs based
on changing plant biodiversity and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, we'll see a shift in the
microbial community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what we do, but at least we've got
some kind of understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now trying to use this to
predict occurrences each year in these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very broad scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to get much finer resolution
as we move forward with our ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: classify the system.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was talking with the guys working
on a reasoning earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we start out in Merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very interested in the
connectivity between above-ground tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants and what was happening in the
soil and trying to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential implications for strain-type
variants and microbial community structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dafic variables in soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, this is just a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dots are closer together,
more similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black dots represent Bacterial taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the colored big dots represent a
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you've done is basically taken
all of the dots, all the OTUs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the similarity in their abundances of
those OTUs starts to drag together or pull
[SPEAKER_00]: apart individual sample types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bog soil and root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the soil around the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All clustered very closely together
because they're very similar environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your root system, so the
rhizoplane, starts to differentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you move up into grapes and leaves
and yellow flowers, we see a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you notice that the OTUs that are
shared in the soil are also shared down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots and lots of these lines
connecting these green and yellow plots
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the blue and red plots over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that immediately told us that the
vast majority of OTUs, the bacterial taxa
[SPEAKER_00]: we found up in the above-ground tissues,
came from down here or were also found
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they didn't come down there,
they came from there by some other route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below ground, you see a significant
differentiation in the high-level
[SPEAKER_00]: functional community structure of these
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proteobacteria dominating those
above-ground systems and mostly organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: which are good at dealing with stressful
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the types of adaphic
variables which drive differentiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems, we see that the adaphics
are very important, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-nitron ratio and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH was a very interesting one for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at different vineyards
throughout a vineyard region.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a vineyard region called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a winery region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a place where there are lots of
vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the same strain of
Merlot, the same ecotype of Merlot across
[SPEAKER_00]: these different vineyards, and then
cataloged how the community structure
[SPEAKER_00]: changed across those vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see pH is a big variable that
drives that, because different vineyards
[SPEAKER_00]: use different types of organic fertilizer
and inorganic fertilizer to fertilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we saw impacts of carbon and
carbon-nitron ratios as drivers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH induced in the different soils was
still a key driver, which is known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, there was a significant
effect due to air temperatures indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: a driver for the microbial terroir,
especially on the above-ground surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 2011 and 2012, we saw a
significant differentiation in the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the leaves between the two annual
time points, suggesting that a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature could have an impact upon
what's happening to the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: population, including in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system variance was being driven by
soil edaphics and also climactic
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing tack again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm switching around because I have lots
of stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all very well and good,
understanding how community structure
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiates across these natural
gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm most interested in is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why certain bacterial organisms are
finding themselves co-associated with this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and becoming abundant versus
this environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the selective pressure driving
those organisms to develop in that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they evolve to adapt to that
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is to start to
rebuild the genomes of those organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: from my perspective, and look at the
evolutionary drivers and the trait
[SPEAKER_00]: selection within those populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reconstruct genomes on a large scale
from a typical metagenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grab lots of different bacterial
isolates from different genera in that
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grab viral genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can even grab some archaeal genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can utilize that information to
build out metabolic models which describe
[SPEAKER_00]: how those organisms interact with each
other and with their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working in a soil system with
hydrochlorohexane pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you create lindane, you have a
pollutant which you throw back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's these huge HCH dumps in
certain countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're illegal in a lot of countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they create a very toxic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by looking at HCH degradation in
the microbial community, we can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms we can culture up and genome
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can map those to metagenomes we
collect from these environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And utilizing that information,
we can predict what the last common
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor of the extant population in the
system would have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And utilizing this information,
it suggests that the ancestor genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: lacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It suggests that 20% of the genes in each
subspecies were absent in the ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these subspecies we see present in the
system have gained genetic material due to
[SPEAKER_00]: a selective pressure driver from the
pollution event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ancestor, we predict, is unable to
grade HCH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it acquires the lind genes to allow it
to degrade HCH from this
[SPEAKER_00]: transposon-mediated lateral gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually even isolate a lot of
the transposons and transposon elements in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genomes of these organisms and
co-associate them and their non-synonymous
[SPEAKER_00]: synonymous ratio with the lindane
degrading regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps us to predict the
functional capability of that organism and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it evolved that capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone from the entire planet,
and I've now zoomed down into one gene
[SPEAKER_00]: genome, but looking across those scales is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also go even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we dig down into the metabolic
capability of an organism, this is work we
[SPEAKER_00]: did in peat moss and looking at
thalmokyota and thermotoplasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thalmokyota oxidizes these long-chain
fatty acids via some trophic interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with methanogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've been able to do by taking
the genomes of these organisms and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at them across redox gradients in the
system, we can identify the drivers which
[SPEAKER_00]: allow these organisms to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got anaerobic respiration with
fumarate as a terminal electron,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at thermoplasmata,
another organism for which we had no
[SPEAKER_00]: genome relatives in the system before,
we see sulfite and organosulfonate
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction as the driver for its capability
to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terminal electron acceptors are
depleted to very low levels in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems, and yet anaerobic
respiration is really dominant still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a key component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why are these RK particularly
abundant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking, you know, we now have fumarate
and organosulfonate are important for
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration of the carbon mineralized in
these peatlands, which gives us an ability
[SPEAKER_00]: at the molecular level to start to
understand the potential implications of
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in this environment upon carbon
mineralization, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the remineralization of components
into the biosphere and driving potential
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in climate systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking, you know, I've gone from making
spurious comments about what happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1840s to driving all the way down into
the potential metabolic interactions of an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism with its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And linking those substrates between the
two is going to become increasingly
[SPEAKER_00]: important in our ability to derive
appropriate, accurate, predictive climate
[SPEAKER_00]: models from what we can understand of as a
system driver in the soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to go to a new study.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brand new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no attention span.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can understand that from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really interested in invading
plants, mostly because when we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: in tall grass prairies, we see this
beautiful relationship between a stable
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem and its very stable but highly,
sorry, very permanent but highly instable
[SPEAKER_00]: community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we perturb that long grass prairie,
even an iota, the system starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: disassemble, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase the nitrogen by a small margin,
the system disassembles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to understand, well,
when a plant starts to invade the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does it influence that below ground
microbial community?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the significant drivers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we say about the legacy of an
invasion in terms of perturbing our
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to restore that environment back
to what it was before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this multi-billionaire in
Chicago who bought up a load of land in
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana because he wanted to be a
biologist when he was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his daddy said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went into the city and he made a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he gets to play in his sandbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you love those people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only in America can I find that kind of
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to play in his sandbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's basically trying to restore
the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the original tall grass prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he bought up 10,000 acres of ranch and
set us with this task.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial task is to try and
understand why that system needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: restored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have three gradients of
cheatgrass, napweed, and leafy spurge,
[SPEAKER_00]: an invasion gradient from high abundance
of the invader to absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all intensive purposes is native
prairie going up to an invaded plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, for the plants, you do see a
very strong gradient between the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity and the invasion plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a highly invaded plot,
you have a highly differentiated plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity, a beta diversity pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria show a similar but not quite as
robust trend apart from in the leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: spurge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, escula.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be leafy spurge or cheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, it shows a very strong
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungi show a much stronger gradient in
response to the invasion pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can start to say that,
yes, invasion does have an impact upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community structure in that
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can differentiate that from,
well, maybe this invasion area was
[SPEAKER_00]: presupposed to be good for those plants
because of these microbial community
[SPEAKER_00]: structures or some kind of adaphic
variable by looking at this over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in common garden experiments,
we planted up these systems with
[SPEAKER_00]: invasives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year after planting, and there's no
real significant difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community structure in either
the native environment in green,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheatgrass in red, napweed in blue,
or spurge in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one year was not enough in these
systems to derive any kind of spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after three years, the system starts
to arrange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now pushing this on,
but we've only just got three years about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're starting to see now is,
at least for napweed and for spurge,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're starting to see significant
clustering of those populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial communities in the below
ground systems, around that invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system starts to show consistent
shifts in chemistry and microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing the chemistry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that these modifications to
soil properties, probably driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in carbon inputs into the soil
due to predatory release of the invader
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not in its native habitat
anymore, reinforce the dominance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: invader, making sure those invasions are
difficult to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think, unfortunately for our
billionaire playboy, that it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to remove some of these
invaders, nigh impossible, once they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain level, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: their legacy on that soil system might be
unattainable unless you go through an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly dramatic ecosystems structural
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, fertilization reduces bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to point this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work with groups in Africa
trying to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been to Africa myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying this to Rebecca earlier,
but I'd love to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are trying to take some of this
data and put it into a more translational
[SPEAKER_00]: framework so that people, growers
especially, can start to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to understand how
differential land use strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as rotations and fertilizers,
fertilizer combinations, can be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase functional capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing numerical models and
statistical models, we can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the potential implications of
differential land management strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: for improving productivity for some of the
900 million poor people who are using
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture as their subsistence
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a completely different note,
how much longer have I got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got to be strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about seven more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are currently sitting in a built
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of you is emitting 38
million bacterial cells into your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all becoming more microbiologically
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are sitting closer to each
other are becoming more microbiologically
[SPEAKER_00]: similar than the people sitting further
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are physically interacting,
you'd be increasing that degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: similarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this environment is the environment
where we're all growing up, where we as a
[SPEAKER_00]: species, unless you grew up on a farm or
you grew up in the Amazon rainforest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, there might be some people
in the room that fit that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of us grew up in a 20th
century home, or some of you 21st century
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has significantly altered your
microbial interaction compared to what
[SPEAKER_00]: your ancestors experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ancestors probably experienced a more
agrarian lifestyle, interacting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cows and the pigs, not playing on their
iPads, but actually living outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: working outside, even as young children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that increased the microbial
biodiversity of their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your child is brought back from the
hospital and lives in this environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's consistently cleaned and made
quite sterile, this architecturally
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial system is altering their
microbial profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enough about health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off this whole gambit on
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to talk a little bit about
microbial forensics as a new track of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine, something I'm very interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out by doing a study for the
Sloan Foundation on the home microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found, among other things, that
families we could look at the bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: community on, say, the floors and the door
knobs, et cetera, and we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high degree of accuracy,
predict which family belonged to which
[SPEAKER_00]: home based on the bacteria they left
behind in their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of those 38 million microbial
cells you're shedding, your microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud needs a microbial fingerprint in
your home, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these shows a particular
surface, focused on the kitchen counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three people, a grown up child
living with his parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the kitchen counter,
person three, their microbiome is the
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant influencer of that
environment, the predominant source for
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria found in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the mother of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no gender bias here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that she actually went
away for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Person one goes away here, and his
microbiome disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the red one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But person two, who is the father of the
home, his microbiome suddenly became
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant in the kitchen when his wife went
away for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kitchen floor was dominated by dog
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this is obviously important,
because dogs are significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing, as well as the mother's
bacteria having a different role,
[SPEAKER_00]: because her cloud is depositing bacteria
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also tell when people are
physically interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a young couple living with a lodger,
focused on this PCOA diagram over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell that the red and blue samples
are closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a couple who are not genetically
related, but who are living together and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing more microbes because of their
physical interaction, hopefully not with
[SPEAKER_00]: the lodger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lodger does indeed show a
significantly differentiated microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the young couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: More similar to the young couple than he
is to anyone else in our study,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's living in the same space and
sharing the microbial cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their noses are not microbiologically
similar, because people don't interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with their noses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with Time Magazine,
we applied this technique with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Departments of Justice to set up some
crime scene investigations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the unfortunate cover of our
issue of Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jared Hampton Marcell, who's my
awesome lab manager and all-around guru,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you ever want to know anything about
DNA extraction, he's your man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he went down to Florida, because it's
warm in the winter, and worked with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida PD and their forensic team on
setting up a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crime scene, we had a professor's house
from a local university, his wife and
[SPEAKER_00]: their cat living in a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went away for like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of the students, like an hour and
a half, sorry, two of the students broke
[SPEAKER_00]: into the house and ransacked their fridge,
stole their TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in there for like 35 minutes,
and then they left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in with the PD, because this
burglary had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we swabbed all the surfaces of the
floor, sequenced the microbiome on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor and on the surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then brought the husband and wife and
the cat back in and sequenced their
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome from their skin surfaces,
subtracted the resident's microbiome from
[SPEAKER_00]: what we found on the floors and the
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a residual microbial finger
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ran that microbial fingerprint
analysis against 8,000 people in our
[SPEAKER_00]: database of skin microflora, also with the
two students who have burgled the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we knew who they were,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could identify the students with
99.6% accuracy based on our 8,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial fingerprint left over is
actually slightly better than using their
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, if you just use standard
genotype fingerprinting and not whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are very excited by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Justice is very excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've funded us and JCPI and a few
other people to expand this into a large
[SPEAKER_00]: study to determine the potential of
utilizing this kind of microbial forensics
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to detect crimes in the coming
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about the number of
people that are put in prison on the basis
[SPEAKER_00]: of bite marks or hair fibers or clothing
fibers, which are bullshit for detecting
[SPEAKER_00]: anything accurately, this might be a
valuable addition to Forensic Team's
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog of tools in order to get the
right, the wrong people in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get the baddies in jail and keep the
goodies out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point this out finally,
because I've got like two minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mapped my microbial dynamics in our
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit about IRB.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't suck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to Ruth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm even going to go worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my youngest son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them fire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my youngest son.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's microbially interacting with the
bedroom floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the only one that really had a hand
interaction with the bedroom floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's crawling around on the floor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was two years old, we did the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see these weird
interactions and map them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add dogs into that mix,
dogs significantly increase the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution patterns of the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They increase the amount of sharing
between people.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague, Rob Knight, showed that if
you have dogs in the home, you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to share more bacteria than if you
don't have dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mapped out that interaction over
six weeks of daily analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the dogs do indeed
significantly increase the diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife maybe used this to rescue a dog
from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Captain Bowdiggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a proper serving captain,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has actually increased the
microbial diversity of our house,
[SPEAKER_00]: only by a small margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our house is none of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was significant compared to the
time periods before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think this is important,
because if you introduce dogs into a
[SPEAKER_00]: family's home, when the child is under the
age of one, they have a 13% reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: the likelihood of developing asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work from University of California San
Francisco has demonstrated that dog
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, such as Lactobacillus,
when gavaged into a mouse's intestine,
[SPEAKER_00]: can significantly reduce the likelihood of
that mouse having an asthmatic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these interactions all suggest that
every single one of you should go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue, I repeat, rescue, not buy,
a dog as soon as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to end there, because I talk
about toilets and stuff, and I got a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would decide to point out we have a
new journal in systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that's interested in microbial
systems biology, and you want to publish
[SPEAKER_00]: in an awesome journal where you get rapid
decisions, blah, blah, blah, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: publish in our journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great line of senior editors
from across the board, kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 110 editors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 110 editors are the ones that will
handle and make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every manuscript, so you'll get fast,
rapid decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am on every single one of those 110
editors to make sure that the reviewers
[SPEAKER_00]: give out reviews in the time frame which
they have agreed upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more waiting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been a senior editor at ISME
Journal and Environmental Microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I understand pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my way of getting out pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: 21st century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I change my microbiome when I go to
the hospital?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or change it afterwards?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not based on the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on the composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, not easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could take a typical
microbiome transplant, and if you waited
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough, you replace your intestinal
microbiome with somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't swab myself with some cordial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that you could do it for a
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, your skin is not just a
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a deep, contextual environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I sterilize your hand right now
with an alcohol wipe, in three minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards, I'll be able to detect your
unique microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bubbles up back from the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done that study on a number of
occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very keen to know that because the
best thing about it is, yeah, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to perturb it, but you're very
unlikely to be able to change your strain
[SPEAKER_00]: level differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you're wearing a hazmat suit,
you're never going to be able to stop it
[SPEAKER_00]: from shedding, even if you wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly leaving your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK, so to be perfectly honest,
I'm split between us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it should be done in small
children's environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, spraying antibiotic
cleaning products onto surfaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: what impact could that be having on
people's health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's got all that mood in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry, over here on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretend the light's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for telling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're most interested in is trying
to see if it affects health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see no real implications between
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I said, if you use these things
and then you interact with something,
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbiome resurfaces pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that certain cleaning products,
things with triclosan, can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might have some hormonal impact,
although that's still tenuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any conflict of interest with
any of the companies that manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that in infants who are
developing, I think it's dangerous to
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize the environment as much as we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should actually be increasing
their interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with Amish and Hutterite
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amish live on personal family farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids always interact with the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hutterites don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only boys over the age of 14 are allowed
on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both from the same ancestral
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both live a very similar lifestyle
apart from that one removal of a microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: source in the Hutterites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amish have virtually no asthma in
their population of 35,000 people we look
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hutterites have 30% asthma in their
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we do something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a remarkable coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say increasing the biological
diversity in a world where we can control
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens through vaccines and control
measures with our community and our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should actually be increasing our
microbial diversity through interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with the natural world rather than
decreasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off my seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an autistic son, so I'm slightly
biased in this respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly believe that there is a
significant link between microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: dysbiosis in the child's gut, especially
early in life, and development of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some evidence that I haven't
published yet in RATS to demonstrate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with it from Sarkis Mazmanian
and Paul Patterson out at Caltech has
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated a significant link between a
mouse model of autism and the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: a probiotic in order to alleviate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is a mouse model of autism?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to ask yourself that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mice do show some very interesting
neurological behaviors and physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbances, which are very similar to
what we see in autistic children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the probiotic does tend to alleviate
those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're moving forward with a phase two
trial now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at its introduction into a human
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have hope that we can rebalance
people's systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out, I'm slightly
biased because my son is perfect just the
[SPEAKER_00]: way he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually embrace neurological
diversity in our community in a way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of people are scared to do
because the other is a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: different and they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe academics, this is the right
audience to talk about that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually not trying to kill my son
and I wouldn't try and change him for the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there are other people who are
desperately in need of an improvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the science at in modifying
microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: In any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the science at in modifying
microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me move it out of humans for a second
and into the soils because I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a complex of interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that I have an interest in
Grossentia, Matt Wallenstein's company,
[SPEAKER_00]: which produces a probiotic to increase
your bud growth for those cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want big buds to make you higher,
then go with Wallenstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that instance, we've demonstrated that
in order to actually allow those bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that we introduce into the soil of these
plants to have a significant ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize, we have to disrupt the ecosystem
and reduce the stable associations between
[SPEAKER_00]: the existing microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do that from our
perspective is to add more carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: different carbon substrates, into the soil
system prior and it shakes up the status
[SPEAKER_00]: quo and then you add your probiotic and
bing, bam, boom, some of them start to
[SPEAKER_00]: take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt doesn't want to know that because
then they're in the soil and he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to add more of his product,
which would make it poorer, so that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But theoretically the same is true for
human intestines or buildings or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: environment you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disrupt the initial ecosystem and then
add and overlay it with a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fecal microbiome transplant works exactly
like that, ostensibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a follow-up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's interesting that you say that
and I think that contradicts one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things you were doing with the
hindcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you that when you have a
community it's sometimes hard to push that
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium to a new state, but yet when
you run that hindcasting you're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that these climate variables are just
going to change the community to respond
[SPEAKER_01]: to that new climate instantly without the
memory of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 30 years for it to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm saying with the hindcasting
that if the climate is this it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take 30 years for that equilibrium to
reshift, probably due to a change in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity in the above-ground system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going at with that trending is an
inability to understand the variance in
[SPEAKER_00]: the parameters of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human gut is never going to change to
an environment where it looks like open
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to stay within certain bounds and
many soil systems are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking at a prairie it has bounds
of influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to go outside of those
bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't necessarily know what those
bounds are, but if we sample through the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter variance space we may be able to
capture those bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can link the parameter variance
space to what the climate does to the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome or even indirectly or directly
we can have at least an ability to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: the variance in that in the microbiome
space, the structural space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structural space of that microbiome
system within the bounds of reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right in the fact that I can't
hindcast back 150 years or even 100 years
[SPEAKER_00]: as in the Nepal system one and actually be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm only utilizing that to demonstrate
the opportunity to identify how similar
[SPEAKER_00]: trends exist irrespective of my ability to
predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will just try to identify an
underlying current of information which
[SPEAKER_00]: predicts an emergent property which I
don't necessarily yet understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that with reasonable accuracy I
think even if it's within the bounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: predictability.

University on the web at cornell.edu Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
