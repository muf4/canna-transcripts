[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I want to thank Penelope and the
students from the Boyce Thompson for
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first time I've ever been
called a translational taxonomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, this is a term, translational
taxonomy is a term I coined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having that term be actually
applied to me is kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: because nobody knows what I'm talking
about until I give, you know, a talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, oh, that's what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to refer to myself as a
phytobacteriologist or sometimes a
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial taxonomist, but a reluctant one
at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a lot of what I do, in fact,
or how I approach research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really want to thank you and your cohort
for bringing me up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned a great deal from you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an aside for mentoring, I believe
that, you know, mentorship goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a relationship and that
mentors often learn as much from their
[SPEAKER_02]: mentees as the mentees learn from their
mentors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the approach that I've
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've learned a great deal again here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I've learned about... Aptamers,
aptamers yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't know what aptamers
are, there are people here that do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going home to research them
because I think they could be really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're going to talk about
translational taxonomy for bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to... Oops, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give you an outline of what we're
going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really want to talk about the complicated
state of bacterial taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people think it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can keep lots of information in
different systems in my head at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not complicated to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say it's complicated,
I think, oh, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I understand why people think
it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you some examples of what I
mean by translational taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to give you a little bit of
where I've come from and where I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: in the lab, what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a feeling for how you might be
able to collaborate with us, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then briefly, I just want to say a few
things that we're doing at PSU in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to do that because that's where
I spend a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These days is as a department head and
head of a research center.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spend a lot of time doing other things
than the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people who do the research,
these are some of the pictures and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see a little bit of their work as we go
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Penelope said, I spent 20 years in
the Salinas Valley of California working
[SPEAKER_02]: for the USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the research I'm going to talk
about was done related to the Salinas
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but much of it is translatable to
Pennsylvania because almost everything
[SPEAKER_02]: except for maybe avocados and citrus that
was grown in the Salinas Valley,
[SPEAKER_02]: and avocados and citrus aren't grown
there, but they're grown in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: is also grown in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the same kinds of questions
can be asked in a different context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, I'm still collaborating
across the board on some of these crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the crops that I worked on when
I was working in Salinas and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: crop values at least at 2012, the values
of these crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just note that for example, if we look
at cabbage, I'll just take an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cabbage production in Pennsylvania is
worth $3 million instead of $35 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of gives you the flavor for
the whole relationship between maybe the
[SPEAKER_02]: Salinas Valley in the salad bowl of the US
is what it's called versus what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to the growers that are producing
these crops, they're extremely valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thinking about disease systems and
how to help those growers with the
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases is important in both places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is translational taxonomy?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think of it just like we think of
translational medicine, which is research,
[SPEAKER_02]: basic research that is brought into a
clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of translational taxonomy in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's looking at the three pillars or
the legs of the stool of taxonomy in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop strategies for disease
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the seat on which we sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in all three pillars of
taxonomy in relationship to bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just give you a little bit of
what that is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna give a little bit about
bacterial taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is that you're all awake at the
end of the bacterial taxonomy part so that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get into the disease management
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if people are nodding off or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because often, taxonomy in general,
people start to glaze over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's something that I do when I
need to fall asleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so these are some of my key interests
in basic taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to put them out there so
that you know that I am a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: nerdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that I really do find pleasure in
reading about species concepts and
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about species concepts for
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, in plant pathogens,
I'm gonna explain a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_02]: path of our concept and how we use the
path of our concept and whether or not it
[SPEAKER_02]: fits in some systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really interested in where it's
breaking down and why it's breaking down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also interested in this question
of natural host range versus experimental
[SPEAKER_02]: host ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means for our classification
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally want to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The binomial system of nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk about that later,
it's another hour seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to junk Linnaeus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he did a great job of taking the
paragraph that was the name of organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: down to two words.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think now we need to take it to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I often talk about identification
with regard to the appropriate level of
[SPEAKER_02]: taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your target?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you need to, at what level do
you need to identify something to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: control the pathogen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And often researchers, we want to get to a
more refined level than a grower might
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the grower doesn't know that they need
to be at a more refined level than they
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having the appropriate taxonomic level
understood for the management practices is
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the places where I go to when I'm
talking about translational taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a background about taxonomy in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about bacterial taxonomy,
originally the taxonomy was based on a
[SPEAKER_02]: very few principles or very few
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really based on those
characteristics that we needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: distinguish those things that would kill
us from those things that won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or those things that would kill our plants
versus those things that won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially the basis of all taxonomy for
bacteria was really based on a few
[SPEAKER_02]: principles and they were specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see here listed a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the result of that was is that
the groups that were classified were not
[SPEAKER_02]: really groups that potentially were
evolutionarily coherent, but they were
[SPEAKER_02]: groups that looked alike and smelled
alike, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that resulted in were species
that were monothetic, that means they had
[SPEAKER_02]: similar characters, and were polyphyletic,
which means they had different
[SPEAKER_02]: evolutionary backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This to us now seems very unusual because
we're used to trying to put groups into
[SPEAKER_02]: monophyletic groups and look at their
evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it from a
historical standpoint, that's not where we
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really the basis of where a
lot of our confusion comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about pseudomonas
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the folks who took the workshop heard
my spiel about pseudomonas yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pseudo, fake, monas is the Greek word
for unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word money comes from the same word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's a fake unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a lot of things in there that
looked alike, but they knew it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really a coherent group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been paying for that ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of this subjective era of
classification where we needed it for our
[SPEAKER_02]: health and well-being, put on top of that
this idea of the new host, new species
[SPEAKER_02]: cliche that has been written about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, few comparative tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I isolated something from broccoli,
for example, I might not have had at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time the ability to compare that pathogen
to pathogens from all over the world or
[SPEAKER_02]: from other hosts, in fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there were few tests that were done
comparatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were lots of different organisms
that were isolated that were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: synonyms for the same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with each new host, people were giving
them names and designating them as
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: As if there was a direct relationship
between the host and the specificity of
[SPEAKER_02]: that species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that isn't necessarily the case,
or wasn't necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was really no way to compare
broadly these organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a second factor that has really
added to the confusion in pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: taxonomy, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this led to a number of misconceptions
and a lot of synonyms within the
[SPEAKER_02]: literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody with me so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, nobody's sleeping yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so layer on top of that,
the advance of our technologies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went from phenotypic testing and
maybe host range testing into looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics that are actually more
amenable to hypothesis testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we talk about nucleic acid-based
techniques for classification,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can actually start to do statistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that even with phenotypic
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we begin to think about using
numerical taxonomy or statistical methods
[SPEAKER_02]: for analyzing these data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're at the point where we can
actually look at whole genomes as well to
[SPEAKER_02]: see whether these organisms are clonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they different?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how different is, of course,
the million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we layer these pieces on top of
that background of confusion, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: or of subjectiveness, it becomes
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it becomes difficult to tease apart
what is the subjective background and what
[SPEAKER_02]: is the objective data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna just show you a little bit
of that as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the same time as we were moving from
the subjective era of classification,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I could spend a lot of time talking
about that era in particular, but as we
[SPEAKER_02]: were moving from that era into a more
objective era, there was also going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bacterial community reorganization of
the code of nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, classification is one part of
the stool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you've got the groups classified,
then you have to name them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And naming is actually done by a set of
rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Classification is done using the
scientific methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's question, inquiry, there's data
that support hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually naming the organism has a set
of rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no rules for classification per
se, or there shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for nomenclature there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nomenclature codes are where the
rules are.
[SPEAKER_02]: People often confuse that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that the classification has
some kind of rules and that there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate classification.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are best practices according to the
scientific method and the thoughts and
[SPEAKER_02]: opinions of the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rules are here in the nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the bacteriologists were
reorganizing the nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they knew that there were
synonyms throughout the bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: nomenclature and throughout the species
that were described.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not just for plant pathogens,
it was also for human pathogens as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got together and developed a new
code of nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the new code of nomenclature
required that there be a catalog of names
[SPEAKER_02]: for valid names of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting into that catalog required
that a name had a validly published
[SPEAKER_02]: epithet, and that means it was published
so we could all read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a modern description, so something
that we would all be able to test and
[SPEAKER_02]: distinguish one organism from another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there had to be a nomenclature
type strain that was deposited somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could all get a hold of it and
compare our strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with this is that it didn't,
for plant pathologists the problem is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't include host range as part of
that modern description.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of our species, in fact,
were based on this new host, new species
[SPEAKER_02]: cliche.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, most of our species
were going to go away and disappear,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact be consolidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the result of that approved
list in 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, the Pseudomonas syringes,
there were 41 nomen species, and most of
[SPEAKER_02]: those were consolidated into Pseudomonas
syringes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with that is that we still
needed to be able to distinguish the
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen from celery, from the pathogen
from tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could distinguish them based on
host range, but not at the level of the
[SPEAKER_02]: species and that modern description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caused a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what plant pathologists did,
and I know some of you all know this,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that we took the nomen species names,
and these are the specific epithets for
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And except for those that are in bold,
they were all put into Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringae as pathobars of Pseudomonas
syringae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those in bold were all left as species
because they could be distinguished by
[SPEAKER_02]: modern methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pathobar concept was put together
as part of the International Society of
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant Pathology's committee on the
taxonomy of plant pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that 10 times fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they developed this idea of a
pathobar, which was supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: temporary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is, okay, we'll put them all
in Pseudomonas syringae, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we have all of this money for
bacterial taxonomy coming through our
[SPEAKER_02]: governments, we'll be able to tease them
apart into real species again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know there's no money for
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over the 40 years that since this
has happened, is it 40 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: 80?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some progress, but it's been
piecemeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really the problem with it,
is that we've had a piece of work done
[SPEAKER_02]: here, a piece of work done there,
and then trying to understand what that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole piece means is what's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll go on from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this concept of pathobar,
really a pathobar is designated as
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has a different host range
or causes a different disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: but is within the same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we don't know whether or not,
we didn't at this time know whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: these things were actually the same
species or different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has caused a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally there were pathobars for the
four species that are listed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently we have pathobars for over 26
species, just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so for plant pathogenic bacteria,
now you don't just have issues with naming
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria at the species level,
which are coded by the International Code
[SPEAKER_02]: of Nomenclature for Prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, if you want to sleep,
that's the thing to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have a code of nomenclature
for naming pathobars, and you have to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with both of them if you're working with
nomenclature of plant pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the kind of thing I like to
do, so I belong on the boards of both of
[SPEAKER_02]: those groups that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue is that we've got species,
subspecies, pathobars, but often we're
[SPEAKER_02]: really working at the level of ecotypes or
strains even, when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to control diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be differences between one
ecotype or serotype, or it could be any
[SPEAKER_02]: different kinds of characteristic that
you've been evaluating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be differences between strains
at very fine levels, and that may be the
[SPEAKER_02]: level of taxonomy that we need to be
working at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pathobar may help, but it may be
at this lower level that you want to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so just a little more confusion for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got this group of organisms that
have been put together, and now we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: concept for species that was layered on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also around the 1980s, there became
this idea that there would be the golden
[SPEAKER_02]: rule for bacterial species concepts,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this became a species definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, people found that if they
did DNA-DNA hybridization, and the DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization values were 70% or above,
that they were likely the same species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to tell you what this process is,
because it's complicated and not many
[SPEAKER_02]: people used it, you take two different
bacteria, you label one of the DNA from
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the bacteria, usually with a
nucleotide of some sort, and that is
[SPEAKER_02]: labeled, and you melt them, mix them
together, and then you let them hybridize,
[SPEAKER_02]: use S1 nuclease to cut away the
single-stranded portions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're left with double-stranded DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can measure the rate of
radioactivity in your sample and compare
[SPEAKER_02]: it to a sample where you've put the same
organism DNA with the same probe,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got the organism with itself,
the organism with something else,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the difference between those is the
percent hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for any experiment where people wanted
to look, is this in that species or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would have to use all of the controls
necessary and do each of these
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridizations, because you couldn't
create a library of them and just go
[SPEAKER_02]: online and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each control had to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that everybody had to have
those type strains or pathotype strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it resulted in only a few
laboratories being able to do taxonomy at
[SPEAKER_02]: the level that we needed to have taxonomy
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a period of about 10 years,
only a few people in white towers,
[SPEAKER_02]: very esoteric, who only wanted to speak to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, wait, this is being broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, let's see, it was not
democratized, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was very difficult for having
normal plant pathologists to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine the species of an organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fast forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the problems with this is that
if a species was determined, let's say in
[SPEAKER_02]: the case of Pseudomonas cerebellum,
for example, it was determined that all of
[SPEAKER_02]: those pathobars actually represented nine
different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they couldn't distinguish those
species one from another using phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can't do the DNA-DNA hybridization in
my lab, I need those phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics in order to be able to
look at whether or not organisms that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: isolating really are one species versus
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nomenclature would not allow us to
name species that were really,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are species, the genoma species is a
genetic species that we understand to be
[SPEAKER_02]: related to one another, but we weren't
allowed to name them because of the code
[SPEAKER_02]: of nomenclature, because there weren't
characteristics that would distinguish
[SPEAKER_02]: them in our laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got a system where we know
that there are nine species, but we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: actually name those species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Pseudomonas syringae still had all
of these species, it had nine species in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people had no idea which was
which.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we know that science is iterative
and classification is an iterative
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we start out with the phenotypes
and kind of the mess that we had in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning, and then we start to tease
these things out using the DNA-DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization, that goes on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we've got sequence data that we're
trying to add on top of that, but we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't really even cleaned up what we
know about the genotypes yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where I think we're going for species
concepts, we're gonna get away from
[SPEAKER_02]: sequences pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna be function as well as
interactions in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_02]: sequences that are gonna be the basis of
the forthcoming species concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody wants to talk about that,
that's a whole nother seminar too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is the current status of
Pseudomonas syringae taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just like to present this to you
because this is a clarification of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm glad you think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna show this to you because I
think it helps formulate this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in gray, you have basically a genomo
species, but people have used sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis to look at the relationship
between these organisms, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for example, genomo species three,
which would be Pseudomonas syringae or
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudomonas tomato if it was ever proposed
to be that, but the type strain would be
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudomonas syringae pathobarctomato DC
3000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people know that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was designated as phylogroup one by
people using sequence analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some people will refer to this
group as phylogroup one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people will refer to it as genomo
species three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pseudomonas syringae syringae,
is Pseudomonas syringae sensu stricto,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: The strictest sense of Pseudomonas
syringae because the type strain for
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudomonas syringae is in that group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here are the different genomo
species or species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, Pseudomonas cannabina,
it's one we're gonna talk a lot about,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a species which many people here,
some people here work on organisms in this
[SPEAKER_02]: group, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: But was previously these were thought to
be Pseudomonas syringae, but now people
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're a different species,
okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody reacting like, no, they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I've ever seen people almost
fight like duke it out was about this kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't change the names of things on
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get really upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what happens when we get a new
pathogen that it might be a Pseudomonas in
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We test the phenotypic characteristics to
begin with when we isolate it and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: go on to do the genetic and taxonomic
analysis in a little more detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna tell you a couple of stories
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much time do we have left?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna tell you a couple of stories
about how we use translational taxonomy
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in between 2002 and 2010, there were a
number of ice outbreaks of disease on
[SPEAKER_02]: parsley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these were fluorescent Pseudomonas,
according to the phenotypic tests that we
[SPEAKER_02]: traditionally do, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that there are two different
pathogens that cause disease on members of
[SPEAKER_02]: the APAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's Pseudomonas syringae pathobar
coriandricular, which causes disease on
[SPEAKER_02]: coriander or cumin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is Pseudomonas syringae pathobar
api, which causes disease on celery,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've never been reported,
in fact, on the other crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought, well, maybe the parsley
pathogen was one of these two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the approach that we have
traditionally used in my lab is a
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-locus sequence analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're moving into a whole genome
sequence analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I think you all know what
multi-locus sequence analysis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sequence a number of housekeeping
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You analyze them as if they were one gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gives you a stronger phylogenetic
signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we were able to show that
these are, and you really can't see this
[SPEAKER_02]: in the translation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are different genomo species of
Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the different species we
talked about in that chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually, with the multi-locus
sequence analysis, there's really a good
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation between the MLSA information
and the genomo species or the DNA-DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization values.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using multi-locus sequence analysis,
you don't need to use DNA-DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, if you look in the
literature, almost all of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: pathology literature now will have
multi-locus sequence analysis instead of,
[SPEAKER_02]: or in addition to DNA-DNA hybridization
for taxonomy, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really good system depending
upon which genes you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we analyze this a little more
closely, the parsley strains came from
[SPEAKER_02]: both genomo species nine, or Pseudomonas
cannabina, or from genomo species three,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the tomato group, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were closely related to
Pseudomonas syringae pathobar API.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, the API, if you look at the,
I do have a pointer, don't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like to move, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get my workout this morning,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at, okay, if you look at the
type strain for Pseudomonas syringae
[SPEAKER_02]: pathobar API, it's quite a bit different
than those BS strains, which is bull
[SPEAKER_02]: selenus as opposed to other BS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a bit different than those other BS
strains up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's been a change in what we're
isolating both from celery and from now
[SPEAKER_02]: parsley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So parsley strains, Pseudomonas syringae
pathobar API, but they're also Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringae pathobar coriandrichola in the
Pseudomonas cannabina group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a place where we actually have
two different organisms causing the same
[SPEAKER_02]: disease on parsley, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that in, you can make
the Pseudomonas syringae pathobar
[SPEAKER_02]: coriandrichola, you can make that pathogen
a pathogen on celery, you can inoculate it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can get some kind of plant
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've never seen it from the field on
celery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, we can get a plant reaction
from Pseudomonas syringae pathobar API on
[SPEAKER_02]: coriandr or cilantro, but in fact,
we never see it from the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so there's a difference between what
we're seeing in the fields and what is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually causing disease and what we
isolate or what we can get to cause
[SPEAKER_02]: disease or plant reactions in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this mean to us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so let's go back to a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the Salinas Valley where the land is
rented for $2,000 to $3,000 an acre per
[SPEAKER_02]: year, it's really expensive land,
that's just the rent, they turn over crops
[SPEAKER_02]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, if somebody is a celery
grower, they might grow some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: other crops, but they're not gonna be
growing lettuce or they may not grow some
[SPEAKER_02]: other kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually stick within the same plant
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody is growing parsley and they
have the disease, we really recommend they
[SPEAKER_02]: rotate out of the APAC completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're growing celery and they get
the disease, they could go and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: cilantro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a crop rotation system that
they can use that they won't see the
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one option, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the kind of strategy we use
once we know what the organisms are and
[SPEAKER_02]: what the host ranges are and what we're
seeing from the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I consider translational
taxonomy, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are going, oh, maybe that'll
work, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna tell you another story.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the story of pepper spot of
crucifers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna tell that primarily because I
know people are working on Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringipathibarmaculicula and organisms
like that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the pepper spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some symptoms of pepper spot on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just tell you that Pseudomonas
syringipathibarmaculicula was a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: pathologist at the USDA at the same time
that Irwin F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smith was the leader of the program there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you notice that that publication is
McCulloch 1911.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, women were allowed to
publish without their supervisors on the
[SPEAKER_02]: publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Irwin F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smith, who was considered the father of
phytobacteriology, had a number of women
[SPEAKER_02]: that worked for him that published
independently and did independent
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's an interesting historical
fact that that happened during the 1920s
[SPEAKER_02]: or early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like 30 years later during the
50s, I guess that's 40 years later,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, later women were not allowed to
publish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, often women did a lot of the
work and were not even included on the
[SPEAKER_02]: publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's a very interesting
historical fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nonetheless, she isolated Pseudomonas
maculicula.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called something else when she
isolated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many, many people work with
Pseudomonas syringipathibarmaculicula.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, they're working with
Pseudomonas cannabina
[SPEAKER_02]: pathobarallisolensis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an organism that has been studied
for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to show you a little bit
about how we determined that this really
[SPEAKER_02]: was a cannabina.
[SPEAKER_02]: The host range for this organism is
different than the Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringipathibarmaculicula host range in
that it is a pathogen of monocots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a number of crops that we'll
see the pathogen on that we don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudomonas syringipathibarmaculicula on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first saw this organism causing
blight on arugula or on broccoli rot,
[SPEAKER_02]: we thought it was Pseudomonas
syringipathibarmaculicula because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: coming off of a crucifer and it was a
Pseudomonas syringi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the organisms that's worked with
as a model for Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringipathibarmaculicula is ES4326.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people here work on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody ever see that number before?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes devastating disease on radish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's a great organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is that there have been
comparisons between this organism to
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudomonas syringipathibarmaculicula and
there have been explanations of,
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular explanations by why they're
different pathobars or why different,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe different races or things like this,
but they're actually different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our thoughts about what this
organism is doing and what the molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're analyzing are doing have to be
broadened to realize we're looking at two
[SPEAKER_02]: different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and I know that's kind of some days
shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this was the different genomo
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's genomo species nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is ES4326 in an MLSA and it is
identical to the pathotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a paper where we actually look at
the whole genome sequences of these
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some differences when we
look at rep PCR and the host range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we isolate from arugula and
radish, we only see the ES4326 type,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is this organism here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now other plants we can isolate and we'll
see Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: syringipathibarmaculiculensis, the
pathotype type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an interesting difference there
that yes, you can inoculate those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and get disease, but really in the field,
what we're seeing is only one type or the
[SPEAKER_02]: other depending upon the host range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but both of these go to both
crucifers and monocots and that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: really exciting place that people are
working as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say that you can see there's
pathobar philidelphi and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: coriander here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a student, Beth Elger, who is now
at Michigan State, who we're working on a
[SPEAKER_02]: paper to go ahead and change the
nomenclature of all of those as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know that you love when we
change the names of organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, I don't know when the
seminar ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: 105.
[SPEAKER_02]: 105.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're gonna forget the cucurbit one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just get talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk a little bit about mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using the same kind of technique
to look at mushroom diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is bacterial blotch in
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been attempts to control this
disease using bacteriophage and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with bacteriophage in a number of
different systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting about it is that in
a mushroom production house, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: have a contained system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I think about biological control,
that seems like a natural place to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to deploy biological control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is we know from the literature
that there are a number of different
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms, that's how we do pathogenicity
testing on mushroom tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of different organisms,
keep going, that cause diseases on
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so blotch can be caused by Pseudomonas
telasi, which is what is the traditionally
[SPEAKER_02]: thought of as the blotch organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also Pseudomonas gingeri,
which is up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a number of other organisms have
been shown to cause the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to know what's causing
disease in mushrooms in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was survey, we've surveyed
so far seven different mushroom houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shows you the sampling array from
two beds of mushrooms that we looked at in
[SPEAKER_02]: one house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for each of these circles,
if there's two colors, that means on one
[SPEAKER_02]: cap, we isolated from two different spots
and got two different species from that
[SPEAKER_02]: same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each color represents a different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one had three different species on
that cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a number of species,
we think at least seven species of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens causing blotch on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when someone came, the researchers in
the past had looked at using bacteriophage
[SPEAKER_02]: to control this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a bacteriophage that was
effective against one organism,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are more than one organism
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're actually working with a class
to isolate bacteriophage to all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different pathogens so that we can try
using a cocktail of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we monitor what organisms are
present in houses, in different houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using a similar approach for black,
black leg and soft rot of a potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some of you know that there's a
Dickey, a dentha cola is now and has been
[SPEAKER_02]: detected in the North Northeast and of
course across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have a new student, Amanda
Mignello, who is working on this and she's
[SPEAKER_02]: really interested in looking at a
microbiome approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: To doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm gonna skip through that and just
tell you that Emma Rosenthal, who was in
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg Martin's lab is currently working on
one of my favorite projects, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: lettuce disease problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bacterial leaf spot on lettuce
that she works on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have already characterized both the
diversity of the organisms that cause the
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, but we also know that there are
three races of the organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That caused the disease and we have
differential hosts for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that at least for one of them,
there's a single gene for resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Emma is working currently, we're
working on classifying these organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're not just xanthomonas
contestris.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really xanthomonas hortorum.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another name change, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's done a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually sequenced 27 strains and
has assembled those for whole genome
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To really understand what these
differences are and what are the factors
[SPEAKER_02]: that are related to the race
relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: She will be using forward and reverse
genetics to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just gives you an idea of what
we're working on now with that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a few seconds, I just want to
say something about the department.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who we are as a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently 26 faculty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run usually around 25 to 26 graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we've been asked to push that up
to 40 by our dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is going, how many graduate
students do I need to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a kind of interesting goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some strategies to get there,
but that's who we are as a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four different signature areas
that we concentrate on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within each signature area,
we actually have four different areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have techniques or strategies for
researching these areas, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether we're in mushroom science and
technology, we use these three different
[SPEAKER_02]: or four different emphases to look at that
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that'll give you kind of a summary
of who we are research wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new strength in phytobiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've hired two people in particular,
but we're part of a larger group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a year ago, we started the Microbiome
Research Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we currently have 100 scientists who
are involved in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 10 that are a part of a cluster
hire, five that were hired in medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: five that were hired in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are about five more that will be
coming on board, three in ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the College of Ag has made a huge
investment in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked me if I would lead the
Center primarily because they wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a really strong foundation for the
faculty that they're bringing in to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to collaborate together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to talk to anyone about how we've
organized this center, but we have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of interaction, even with the arts.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we're having a symposium in
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two different sessions that we'll
be having at our weekly meetings that are
[SPEAKER_02]: about arts and microbiomes in ways that
it's really good I'm not controlling it
[SPEAKER_02]: because I would have never thought to do
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a documentarian who is very
interested in microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that person is doing is very
different than a plant pathologist would
[SPEAKER_02]: have a documentarian do, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But across the board, there's a lot of
different kinds of interactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: including with our social scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say that we have a lot of
different initiatives within the
[SPEAKER_02]: department that comes with having a new
department head.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbiome center is key to
strengthening our environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology emphasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have strengths in STEM and access
to STEM and diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building a couple of bilateral
programs with international institutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The primary one is with the University of
Pretoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been very successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have gotten a lot out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The workshop that we had today is part of
our comprehensive professionalism
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I've gotten a
lot of pleasure in is really engaging with
[SPEAKER_02]: the alumni in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, last thing is just to advertise the
degrees we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think two things that are unique about
our program is we have dual titles with
[SPEAKER_02]: plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our students walk out the door with a
PhD in plant pathology and maybe a PhD in
[SPEAKER_02]: biogeochemistry or plant pathology and
international ag and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have an online certificate in ag,
biosecurity, and food defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a couple of minors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a major in plant pathology
for the undergraduates, but we have
[SPEAKER_02]: minors, which feed our programs,
feed your programs, in fact, and feed
[SPEAKER_02]: other people's programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so more the merrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for listening to my
acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you all for your
patience and listening to some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things we do in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my current team.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the current team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure who's on Zoom, but you might ask
who's on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's on Zoom?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's on first?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hear anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've run right up to the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to say, I planned this talk last
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided that I wanted to do something
different than I've done before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is my first time trying to
talk about these things in this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll try it again next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave a really elegant example of the
deciphering some of the entities
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with these diseases of parsley
and other hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of a detailed knowledge and
study won't be often available for the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So presumably, you envision a tiered
management strategy where you use your
[SPEAKER_00]: management recommendations to parallel the
study or understanding of biology of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, often before I would even
begin a research project, what I ask
[SPEAKER_02]: growers is, what are your options?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to manage this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things you are likely to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I get those answers, then I can
actually target the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they know it's a pseudo, if they know
it's bacterial and they only have two
[SPEAKER_02]: options for control, that's all we need to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bacterial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really depends what options are
available to the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the mushroom growers, they're very
innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some extra money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would be willing to invest in
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be willing to invest in
development of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at, for example,
these development of a biocontrol for them
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that high value cash crop would
make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't necessarily make sense for
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my first question is always to the
producers, what kinds of things do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have money for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kinds of things are you willing to
do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlie, we don't have many mushrooms
produced in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: What sort of options do Pennsylvania
mushroom growers have for control or
[SPEAKER_03]: reduction of bacterial diseases of
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a fun crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved to Pennsylvania, I thought,
how lucky could a pseudomonas girl be,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you've got all these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, pseudomonas is involved in
the stimulation of mushroom growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the actual fruiting body formation by
the fungus is stimulated by pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_02]: putative-like organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a whole nother ball of wax,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to kill off the good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to kill off the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things that conventional
growers can use is chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic growers cannot use chlorine,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: The primary methods for control are
sanitation, steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they steam their whole rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can steam the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And humidity control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that isn't optimal for, like the
things that are optimal for pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: control are not optimal for growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're constantly doing this fine
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the organic systems, they really
tip toward disease often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, in fact, we were just awarded a
million dollar ORI grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research Extension Initiative funding to
work on this and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases in relationship to biological
control, in particular, and microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis more generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really have humidity control,
sanitation, and chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you take away chlorine for the
organic folks, it's sanitation and
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're really looking for other
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're already starting to
get a picture that their disease problems
[SPEAKER_02]: are more complicated than they once
thought, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that really is my job is to let people
know that their disease problems are more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated than they thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't just deal with one breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to work with us, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious of how all this flux in
taxonomy, how that is intersected with
[SPEAKER_01]: international trade barriers and
regulatory sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they keeping up with the changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in fact, I have been working with
APHIS in particular and just the
[SPEAKER_02]: permitting section to try to get them up
to date in the understanding of what the
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial taxonomy is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of them really do understand
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they bring new people in,
we want to make sure that they're up to
[SPEAKER_02]: date as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would have to look at my calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe there's a visit to APHIS on
my calendar soon to give the whole two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three hour version of bacterial taxonomy
at a glance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the folks from the Penn State
Department of Agriculture asked me to come
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk about bacterial taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to them, well, I feel like I've
done an adequate job when I've talked for
[SPEAKER_02]: a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long can I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know a week of bacterial
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always try to make it fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had a number of people come visit
me for a week so that they can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you know what translational
taxonomy is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: No further questions, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
