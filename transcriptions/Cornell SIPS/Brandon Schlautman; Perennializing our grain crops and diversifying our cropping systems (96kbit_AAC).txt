[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank all the graduate students
for putting this on in Corteva as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun for me so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was placed appropriately in the
order of speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a lot just listening before
my presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today I want to talk to you a little
bit about the Land Institute where I work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an institute that's founded about 40
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a certain set of uncommon problems or
uncommon goals in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to begin with a quote from
the founder of the Institute, Wes Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wes says that it's impossible for us
to operate in our daily lives and not
[SPEAKER_02]: create the world that everyone must live
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we desire ranges the genetic code in
all of our major crops and livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot avoid participating in the
creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is in agriculture far and away our
largest and most basic artifact that human
[SPEAKER_02]: culture and the creation totally
interpenetrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is very real, very obvious as we
look at how humans have changed the
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape of the world today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look in the mountains of China where
we have paddy rise systems and terraces,
[SPEAKER_02]: or Gray County, Kansas, the Kansas,
Nebraska irrigated agriculture areas,
[SPEAKER_02]: or places like I was in January,
Taipei, Palestine, where through
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture over thousands of years,
we've eroded away the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil that was there to a point where
not only can we not do agriculture here
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, but the ecosystems that preceded
them, the oaks, savannas that were there
[SPEAKER_02]: before, cannot reestablish even after
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we've done through
domestication and the technologies that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've developed to create the agriculture
that we have today is fairly amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at a map of the human
appropriation of net primary productivity
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world, we see that many of the
areas we think of as being very
[SPEAKER_02]: productive, we're appropriating up between
60 and 80% of the biomass, the net primary
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity that would have been there
before agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in the 80% range of the
ecosystems that we're replacing them with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty amazing when we think
about what the crops that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: domesticated started as.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that we're growing those crops
has problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we think about how our crops are
grown, they're grown in these systems that
[SPEAKER_02]: require continual disturbance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kept at an ecosystem level that's
early in the successional gradient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we never allow ourselves to develop
these systems to retain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, we have leaky agro
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see that in our cropping
systems, we have losses of biodiversity
[SPEAKER_02]: from those times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lots of landscapes in those
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have losses of soil resources from
those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we continue to lose nutrients through
volatilization, through leaching,
[SPEAKER_02]: through runoff, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is ultimately inefficient,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is keeping our net primary
productivity down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to maintain the net primary
productivity of those systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to supplement those ecosystems
with continuous inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to look at biodiversity loss,
this is a map of the United States showing
[SPEAKER_02]: the counties in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every county that has a color,
at least 20% of the cropland in that
[SPEAKER_02]: county is devoted to crop production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look around at big portions of the
US.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a small effective crop number,
meaning on 20% of the landscape,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's maybe only three, four,
maybe only one or two species that are
[SPEAKER_02]: taking up the surface area of that
landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_02]: My family farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: In York County, Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow, there's like three to four
effective crop species on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: But out of the 366,000 acres that are
there, 84% of them are devoted to crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 82, 2.5% are devoted to just two
crops, corn and soybean production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think about, OK, what's happening
on those other 16% of the acres?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a couple of towns.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a golf course.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really easy for us to be
desensitized to those environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's normal for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was talking with some of the other
speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew into Detroit on my commute here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always look out the window,
and I see an 80 here, and I see a quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: section here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's normally a perfect grid square.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really interesting flying into
Michigan, where you still see the
[SPEAKER_02]: sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was like the back 40 or 20 that
was devoted to timber still.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that was a part of that
culture, I guess, that was there before
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not a part of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen something like that in
where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that is really important
to remember is that we're losing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil from our agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at a natural ecosystem,
there is soil formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fetigenesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're building soil through rock
weathering really, really slow,
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000ths of a millimeter per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're developing new technologies and new
techniques to do agriculture better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're still having net losses of soil
on an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a small percentage of our agriculture
is devoted to no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about 5% no-till in the US right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of the agriculture is still
plowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing up to, you know, 1.5
millimeters of soil per year from those
[SPEAKER_02]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we think about, you know,
what does sustainability mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have soil left to do
agriculture, where is that food going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we can look at soil losses
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2012, most of our most productive areas
are still losing, you know, enormous
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at, you know, here's the
Iowa-Illinois region.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing 5 to 10 metric tons per
hectare of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about, you know, the volume of soil
that that is and where is it going,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we've lost from most
of the soils is the organic matter that
[SPEAKER_02]: was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost – lose it as CO2 through
respiration and oxidation of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: organic content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a map – I've farmed a
little bit with my cousin-in-law in Kansas
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a map of one of our fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here really clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my cousin-in-law took the field over
about eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the stuff that's yellow and green,
this was native pastures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hadn't been tilled in anyone that could
remember his lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have soil organic levels that are
in, you know, threes, fours, fives,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even sixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These areas that are red, those have been
farmed continuously for the last,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, unknown number of decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty typical when we look
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just 30, 40 years of tillage, we reduced
the soil organic matter that was there by
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 percent up to 50 or 60 percent,
depending where we are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil organic matter is very important,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our nutrient storage system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we store the water that our
crops need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we store the nitrogen that our
crops need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the phosphorus is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where everything is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we lose that, when we have sand,
it's even more important for us to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue adding inputs to the system every
year to maintain the fertility and the
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity of those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention the CO2 that we're losing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that CO2 that's in the organic
matter is old, net primary productivity
[SPEAKER_02]: from how many years ago, we're unsure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the other thing that we lose often
is our nitrogen and our phosphorus losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of our phosphorus losses,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's imported phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's animal manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rock phosphate that's mined from
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nitrogen is the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that this has major consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, these aren't just some
unique outcome of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are predictable consequences of an
agricultural practice in the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing it by keeping our
agroecosystems at this early stage of
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary succession.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have hypoxic areas around the
world, dead zones around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, you know, the largest dead zone
in the world this year, 20,000 hectares
[SPEAKER_02]: annually in size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not doing that much to address
this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're projected that we're going to
continue increasing our nitrogen inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: annually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we – 2 percent of the world's
energy every year goes to creating
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge reason why we're all here is
because of that unique invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're – we have not really improved
our nitrogen use efficiency very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S., now we're in the 60 percent
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: But globally – our global average is about
42 percent nitrogen use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1 percent of the world's energy is
creating nitrogen that's not used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's running off and leaving the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elsewhere as nitrous oxide emissions,
the potent greenhouse gas, or as nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: leaching into our groundwater supplies or
runoff into our marine ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, you know, as a consequence of
agriculture and human activity in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're beginning to cross these planetary
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans are now, you know, the biggest
determining factor of climate and
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a unique time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In history, you know, that one species is
controlling so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we look at what kind of
boundaries we've already crossed – you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we've already crossed about four.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that our climate is increasing at
a rate that we have uncertainty about what
[SPEAKER_02]: the risks of that are going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things like genetic diversity loss
and land system change from a forest
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem that's holding the carbon in
place and the nutrients in place to our
[SPEAKER_02]: cropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also crossed these boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's very interesting to me,
you know, we have really disrupted these
[SPEAKER_02]: biogeochemical flows through our nitrogen
and phosphorus fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we have UN agencies and
international agreements about things like
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change and what temperatures we
want to talk – be at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't really addressed this
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have an international agency or
agreed upon, you know, levels of inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just continue to project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really used nitrogen on the
whole African continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a place where we imagine –
right now, they're in the 80s for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as they begin really applying
it, we imagine that efficiency is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when we talk about,
you know, uncommon plants for uncommon
[SPEAKER_02]: goals – so uncommon goals of plant
breeding, of our plant science,
[SPEAKER_02]: of our research, you know, these are still
pretty uncommon goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're at a time in history where they
need to become our common goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us need to be thinking about
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a graduate student, where is your crop
grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: What soil type is it grown on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the vulnerability of that soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have to do to maintain the
fertility of those soils?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very important for us to
consider in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, more importantly,
how are we going to address these issues?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we change in our crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the Land Institute – Wes Jackson,
once again, you know, this is what he
[SPEAKER_02]: says.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since nature has the most sustainable
ecosystem, and since ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture comes out of nature,
our standard for a sustainable world
[SPEAKER_02]: should be nature's own ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look at some ecosystems that have
reached this, you know, later-term
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary succession, where we have proper
earth systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the nitrogen cycle that's
functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're retaining nutrients in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do we notice about those?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whether it's the prairie,
whether it's a tropical rainforest or a
[SPEAKER_02]: savanna, or even coastal wetlands and
taigas and tundras, all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems are composed of, you know,
really noticeable things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, they all are predominantly made of
perennial species, perennial plant
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, it's never just a single species.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's – some species might be more
dominant in the ecosystem than others,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there is always diversity in those
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is becoming the goal of our
organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at a natural ecosystem,
right, because we're perennial and high
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity, we have soil formation
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have increased soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're retaining nutrients in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a habitat that allows for a
functional soil microbiome to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have water infiltration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have rock, like in Palestine,
where the water just lands on the rocks
[SPEAKER_02]: and runs down the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using the nutrients that are landing
on that landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look at our current
agro-ecosystems, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized by annuals, crops,
low diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have reductions in soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have nutrient losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have functioning soil
microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have poor water infiltration in a lot
of landscapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're trying to envision a new –
what we call natural systems agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not natural, it's still engineered,
it's still humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still the ones that are affecting
the climate and the environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, by designing these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're composed of perennial crop
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have moderate diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we envision them as
actually allowing soil formation to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen, having increased soil organic
matter, retaining nutrients, having
[SPEAKER_02]: functional soil microbiomes, and
infiltrating water that's landing on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what are some of the
reasons that maybe these later
[SPEAKER_02]: successional ecosystems are functioning?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one, we can see that we
actually probably have increased net
[SPEAKER_02]: primary productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a field in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a field that's been filed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about to be planted to sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time of the year, this is one
of our researchers field at the Land
[SPEAKER_02]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is silphium, which is a perennial
relative of sunflower in the Asteraceae
[SPEAKER_02]: family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it's big and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we have living root systems,
they're going to begin growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing photosynthesis as soon as the
environmental conditions are appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we have warm enough
temperatures in the spring, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be actively growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully someday as a whole,
you know, we can see that instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: taking away most of the net primary
productivity as seed from the system,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a larger pool of net primary
productivity to begin from, and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: still take large yields of seed away,
leaving some of the net primary
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity there to feed the soils and
to build the organic matter and those
[SPEAKER_02]: other ecosystems that we need for
functional soil microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also can see that perenniality can
increase the soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at temperate grasslands,
perennial species are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, perennials have a 40 to
60% below ground allocation of their net
[SPEAKER_02]: primary productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of the organic material
that's landing on the landscape is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going into living roots in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our annual grains, we only have 15 to
20% below ground allocation of net primary
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity, and it's turning over each
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the vision of the landings
here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is an uncommon goal,
but one that we know is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the top is intermediate wheatgrass,
species that we've been domesticating with
[SPEAKER_02]: other people around the world for quite a
few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the bottom is our annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the differences in the net
primary productivity of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount of organic matter,
of carbon that's entering the soil each
[SPEAKER_02]: year in those root systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really the vision of the
future, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can stand as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to bringing carbon into
the systems, these large living root
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, you know, accomplish most of
their goals when grown on slopes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can limit water erosion or covering
the soil and holding the soil all year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can also, you know, limit our water
contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water that's there is being
infiltrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have large living root systems that are
going to be uptaking all of the nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in our soil and preventing runoff
into our stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of planting, you know,
buffer strips in and around our fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have field-scale buffer strips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I hope that we can
envision and dream of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resource partitioning in diverse systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at a diverse system,
we have, you know, biomass and we have
[SPEAKER_02]: root organs and plant organs of all
different shapes and sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are big taproots,
reaching deep in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have, you know, fibrous root
systems that are putting a lot of matter
[SPEAKER_02]: into the top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really have this partitioning,
this niche partitioning that happens in a
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary, later term, successional
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're capturing nutrients and holding
them in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all levels of the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're capturing sunlight and water at all
levels of what's supposed to be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we can imagine even with
perennial grains, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have a perennial cereal rye species,
we have some ecosystem services that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're holding the soil in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're providing continuous living roots
there that are creating habitat for things
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly like AMF fungi and other soil
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we add new species like alfalfa to this
mixture, we have another additional
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem service that we can apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these nodules providing habitat
for nitrogen-fixing rhizobia species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, we're bringing nitrogen
into the system to facilitate the growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and development of our soil organic
nitrogen pool and other plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, you can imagine that we add
maybe a third species, a perennial
[SPEAKER_02]: sunflower type of variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we add a second species,
a perennial perennial perennial relative,
[SPEAKER_02]: that in addition to growing additional
biomass and using the resources there is
[SPEAKER_02]: also providing, you know, habitat for
beneficial insects, for pest control,
[SPEAKER_02]: and habitat for other wildlife in our
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, you know, we have this
gradient of soil health that has improved
[SPEAKER_02]: through this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are really the uncommon goals
of our institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working to develop perennial grain
crops through domestication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this species intermediate wheatgrass
here is a perennial wild relative of
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat, and we have a direct domestication
program for that crop, or through wide
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have multiple other programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at other common annual grain
crops that we're trying to use wide
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization to bring perenniality into
those species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, in addition, we're trying to
deploy these grains in diverse crop
[SPEAKER_02]: assemblies on agricultural landscapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in addition to the land institute,
we have collaborators all around the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that are interested in working on these
same crops and cropping systems with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really increasing quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a perennial rice breeding program
and researchers that we're working on that
[SPEAKER_02]: have developed perennial rice varieties
that are planted on thousands of hectares
[SPEAKER_02]: already and have been almost equally as
productive as the annual rice varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in those same regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six harvests in a row, three years,
two perennial events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so perennial legume breeding,
that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The land institute hired me in 2016 to
position as a perennial legume breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was 2016 was the International Year
of the Pulses, the FAOs year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the year before was the International
Year of the Soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we recognize the importance of
pulses and legumes in this idea of what a
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable future agriculture could look
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed Alison's talk today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think looking into the future,
the one thing that we're missing still is
[SPEAKER_02]: the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need sustainable inputs of nitrogen
into our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And legumes are one way that we can do
that, especially a perennial you
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish that's developing a long-term
root system and you're slowly releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's becoming part of the soil organic
nitrogen pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know, for example, like,
well, we'll just keep talking here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was hired in 2016 without a species
or a crop or even a vision of exactly how
[SPEAKER_02]: the perennial legumes were gonna fit into
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started it late fall,
2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember kind of sitting in my
office with a set of questions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: still the same questions that I'm asking
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like the first question is,
what legumes are perennials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which legumes are there that I can work
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: A next question was, which species should
I choose?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many are there and which one can I
work on?
[SPEAKER_02]: The next question Larry's presentation was
really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we develop an idiot type for
whatever species we're working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually as a breeder, how do I
develop a breeding program for that crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: So which legumes are perennial?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually began working in a
collaborative project while I was still at
[SPEAKER_02]: the University of Wisconsin as a graduate
student a couple of months before I
[SPEAKER_02]: started the position with Dr. Allison
Miller through this perennial agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: project global inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to build an inventory of
all the legume species and look at their
[SPEAKER_02]: life history.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no nice list of what are the
perennial, what are the taxa in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabaceae family and which ones are annuals
and which ones are perennials and what
[SPEAKER_02]: type of perennial they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had this idea that we wanna have
perennial herbaceous legumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fit into our sort of envisioned
cropping system of things that are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: back every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of 20,000 some species,
about 30% were perennial herbs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind they were interested in,
4,800.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I had my list of which ones are
perennials, but we still have to decide
[SPEAKER_02]: which species to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a large number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really interesting to me,
so there's 20,000 some species in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabaceae family.
[SPEAKER_02]: As humans, we use maybe 15 as foods that
we eat and maybe another 30 to 40 as ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that we use as forage crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's this whole broad amount of
diversity that in some instances we're at
[SPEAKER_02]: risk of losing and that we don't really
know that much about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we choose those 15 because those were
the obvious candidates to people 10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago when they started domesticating
plants around the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did it just kinda happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there just that one unique person who
saw that plant and was used to eating that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and thought, I'm gonna try planting
the seeds one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just kind of went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it's at this, which species
should we choose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the next question that I
focused on kind of my first few months at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Land Institute and really developing
this idea of what do we want in a crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some basic concepts, we care about
its economic potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we establish it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the field management strategies
that I need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it harvestable?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the yield potential?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it adaptable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be only grown in a specific
location in the world or can it be grown
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the place?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the seed quality
attributes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's its nutritional profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have any anti-nutritional
compounds in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be used like CBD in some high value
product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like a quick way to commercialize a
new species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then very importantly, what are the
ecosystem services that this species could
[SPEAKER_02]: provide?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it require resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it retain resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it provide other provisions for other
purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it dual use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be used as a fiber and a seed crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I wanted to think about the
ease of breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that things like plody level
and genome size are really gonna be an
[SPEAKER_02]: important criteria long-term and how
successful we're gonna be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also this availability of genetic
resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're a new scientist and you
wanna start doing something your first
[SPEAKER_02]: year, availability of germplasm and
genetic resources, and then really
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about what's the quickest way
that I can release something that's useful
[SPEAKER_02]: in agriculture, dual use became kind of
the most important criteria for me right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still evaluating many other native
and wild species that haven't been used
[SPEAKER_02]: before, but moving forward with these
ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we think about what perennial
legume species are being used right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we have many common perennial
forages, especially alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfalfa's probably the perennial
herbaceous species that's had the most
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic research, agronomic research,
and we grow it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've really been looking hard at
these perennial forage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that I can collaborate that
know something about these crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seed available for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really makes sense to start with those
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking at them as perennial
companion legumes, something that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: interplant between rows of other annual or
perennial grain species as our nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: input.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also as kind of the perennial
grain, perennial pulse idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we harvest something that's edible
that can be used as a new pulse crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was sort of the beginning of
my, how do we develop an idiot type?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first year I just kind of ran with
it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably we want big seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So alfalfa is a great example of a crop
with really good potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a whole seed industry that's
already existing to produce seed for
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow a lot of it in the Western United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sometimes achieving yields,
you know, 600, 800,000 pounds an acre
[SPEAKER_02]: without really breeding for those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are pretty comparable to the
lentil yields that are in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, grown in very similar ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I think at first,
naively I was thinking, well, we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have bigger seeds for sure, because people
aren't going to want to eat really small
[SPEAKER_02]: lentils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, thinking about
long-term seed establishment of forage
[SPEAKER_02]: legumes is pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to either till a lot and have
really firm seed beds and plant very
[SPEAKER_02]: shallow, which is the same as with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we didn't want tillage to be part
of our long-term cropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also can't have that much residue
on the surface of the soil because the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are small and can't push up through
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was hoping that, you know,
increasing seed size will help with
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started with this germplasm called
alboria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edwin Bingham had worked on it at the
University of Wisconsin for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an alfalfa wide hybrid with
metacago arboria, which is a woody
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial shrub from the Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has seed size that are quite a bit
larger than conventional alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one cycle of selection,
we saw some interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, out of my half-sib families,
I had families that were really
[SPEAKER_02]: outperforming the alfalfa checks in the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as, you know, this is just data from
the USDA grid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we look at the two subspecies of
metacago sativa, compared to all of my
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding populations as a whole,
you know, we are actually shifting the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed size of alfalfa in some way closer
towards this other species' natural seed
[SPEAKER_02]: size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another crop that I'm really interested in
is Sainfoine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another perennial forage legume that
has a long history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fascinating in that we look at
archaeological evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans were eating this at one point in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's caves in Turkey and around that
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding charred remains of these
seeds now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been some recent interest in
actually using it as a seed crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: a grain crop already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a few studies in Italy and
in Europe where organic protein sources
[SPEAKER_02]: are really in need and really expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've been actually looking at
these seeds as a possible protein delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feeding trials with pigs and chickens
and other monogastric like mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, we haven't seen any negative
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been good rates of gain that are
comparable to soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like there's a lot of
promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has, you know, when we think about
idiotypes, I think lupins kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: encapsulate what I imagine the morphology
of a new perennial grain would look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this beautiful terminal raceme
that has all these nice little flowers on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine being skimmed off easily
with a combine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we expect this to be one of the big
problems with investigating perennial
[SPEAKER_02]: forbs in general, is that they don't
really have this nice determinate growth
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern and then senescence pattern that
we can think of in our annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dry down sort of naturally on their
own and are easily harvested with a
[SPEAKER_02]: combine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe in a system like this
where we have dry seed pods up above,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can use a stripper header on the
combine and come through and just skim
[SPEAKER_02]: them off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've never seen a lupin pod,
they're super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look pretty much like a soybean pod.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they look like a stem of soybeans with
pods all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three or four seeds in a pod and pretty
good size.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three other species of lupins that
have already been domesticated annuals
[SPEAKER_02]: that are grown around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of the species that was
domesticated by the Incas in South
[SPEAKER_02]: America, its progenitor is actually a
perennial species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of opportunities to
explore that in more detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cross it with the native species
lupinus polyphyllus that I'm interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the ornamental lupin that you
see planted in people's flower beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been breeding already for these,
you know, increased reproductive output.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an interesting one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I started this second
round of, okay, how do we develop an
[SPEAKER_02]: idiotype?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really began when I started
thinking about companion legumes and how
[SPEAKER_02]: do you breed for something that you're
going to plant between rows of something
[SPEAKER_02]: else?
[SPEAKER_02]: If your phenotype is actually,
you know, the expression of a phenotype in
[SPEAKER_02]: a different crop, how do you select for
that interaction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what sort of breeding system do you
use?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have, people have been trying
this for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the species I'm working on is cura
clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tried using it as kind of this
living continuous cover mulch system,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Albrecht worked on it a lot in
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig Schafer's worked on it in the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've tried all sorts of ways of
trying to kind of manage the compatibility
[SPEAKER_02]: and the competition in that system,
but no one has taken a breeding approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one has really gone through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way that we can solve that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we select to change these systems?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I began to think about
really in detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is our cropping system?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the row spacing going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we planting in between?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the limitations of a candidate
species in that system?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these new species that we try,
you know, I'm getting wild seed sent from,
[SPEAKER_02]: either I buy them from native seed
nurseries or there's like these wild seed
[SPEAKER_02]: collection networks where they just,
you email this person and they mail you
[SPEAKER_02]: some seed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collected this in this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have terrible germination rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually there's a lot of outbreeding,
depression, and genetic load that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to evaluate these things in
plots even because, you know, they're hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which traits are components of seed yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: So even like in the lupinous polyphyllus
seed yield study, we don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: should I be selecting for more seeds per
pod or should I be selecting for more
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers on a raceme?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what traits are increasing the
compatibility of my legume in my mixtures?
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, you know, for these mixtures,
can I breed plants in monoculture stands
[SPEAKER_02]: or in space plant nurseries?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do I have to do my breeding in between
rows of the companion that they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be grown with?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the projects we started last
year, last year was our first year of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotyping with a technician and master
student in my lab, is really trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: design these intermediate wheatgrass
alfalfa bicultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we began a multi-state study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about 30 varieties of alfalfa
planted in between rows of intermediate
[SPEAKER_02]: wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Wisconsin, Kansas, and Minnesota,
really trying to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these varieties are really divergent,
entries are really divergent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have branching root systems,
tap root systems, really quick regrowth,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there certain traits that are
correlated with the system?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe are there certain varieties that
we can already recommend to farmers to
[SPEAKER_02]: adopt this system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because kernza intermediate wheatgrass is
in this early stage of
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-commercialization and farmers are
beginning to plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if we could,
you know, have farmers start planting this
[SPEAKER_02]: in a cropping system in a way that we know
long term is where we should be moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started designing a cropping
system and this is how we're running it at
[SPEAKER_02]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of them are perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both produce a lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: In late April, early May, depending where
you're at, the alfalfa almost begins to
[SPEAKER_02]: flower the first time, depending where
you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the intermediate wheatgrass has grown
as well and so you can actually have a
[SPEAKER_02]: grazing event or a forage harvest here
just before this onset of tiller
[SPEAKER_02]: elongation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year, our trials in Kansas,
we were producing one and a half or so
[SPEAKER_02]: tons of really high quality dry matter at
that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: After this forage harvest, we left to let
it go and the alfalfa is going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering again in late May, early June.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it's between rows,
we can't really harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this time, the intermediate
wheatgrass really starts closing up the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we look at the alfalfa,
we're actually declining in biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: continually from about this, you know,
May, June transition until we ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: have mature seed that we're harvesting
from the intermediate wheatgrass here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end, we have residue that we
can once again graze or bale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at this cutting last year,
we were averaging about four and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: tons dry matter in our plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not nearly as good quality of hay,
but it would be fine as grinding forage
[SPEAKER_02]: for heifer diets or beef diets.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, it starts regrowing again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the middle of September,
we can take a third cutting, a third
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest or a third grazing event where
we're going to produce another one,
[SPEAKER_02]: two tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our grain harvests are respectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, we were in the 700 or so pounds
of seed yield per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also are producing between six and
seven tons of dry matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really this new system that we
can imagine farmers adopting hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: very quickly, especially in Kansas,
where we still have a tradition of having
[SPEAKER_02]: these warm season pastures that farmers
are most farmers still own a small herd of
[SPEAKER_02]: cattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we're we're generally
buying feed and hay and feeding hay in
[SPEAKER_02]: this period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, stretching stretching it
out and reducing the hay we need to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: this time before we move to our warm
season pastures in the middle of May would
[SPEAKER_02]: be a great benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once again, once our warm season
pastures start declining in productivity,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can move them back to our cool season
grass legume mixture here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending how many fields we have,
you know, we can bulk residue and graze
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really fits nicely into our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also looking at cura clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Abby Hahn is here with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a research resident at the Land
Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really starting to begin to
understand, you know, what is controlling
[SPEAKER_02]: the compatibility in this system,
especially with maize and with
[SPEAKER_02]: intermediate wheatgrass?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a project we plan to find
out all the accessions in the USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're characterizing really well using
some interesting morphometric approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: for leaf size and area and shape and
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at white clover research when
they're using in mixtures with grasses,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaf color and the leaf shape and size
and really makes a difference in the
[SPEAKER_02]: competitiveness of the cura clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Kansas, we really noticed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's these clovers that have sort of
a bluish color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really a waxing waxy coating
on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really preventing water losses in
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those ones seem to perform really well
in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, how do we develop a breeding
program?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this has been a very fun experiment
for me to start from nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the first year we're
asking questions like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what piece of equipment do we have that we
can plant these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do I get the seeds out of the pods
of my alfalfa plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I harvest my lupin seeds before
they all shatter and fall on the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can measure yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should I not let them, should I not
measure yields?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I just measure after everything
shattered as a way to find ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: indehiscent?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you know, because we don't
have an idiot type, how do we do breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: on the fly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to develop an idiot type
in advanced populations?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what to select for while
we're still doing the agronomic work to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what the cropping system is and
how it should function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this has been an interesting
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you think about a typical forage
legume system, we want to look at yields
[SPEAKER_02]: for two, three, four years in a row before
we really make our selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want this long-term yield stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is what I've started doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a cura clover example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really starting to do this with the
five species that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa, cura clover, lupins, sanfoin,
and alfalfa, again, as a grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting with maybe 100 selected
plants here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And making a polycross in the greenhouse
in the late fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did this last November.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're moving into, you know,
the beginning of year two, or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's kind of year one,
but we harvest the seeds from those
[SPEAKER_02]: polycrosses, and maybe I want to plant 100
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have 10,000 total progeny that I'm
going to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of plants to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to do some selection
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to select vigorous seedlings
that haven't succumbed to diseases in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, specifically inoculating them
for traits like the phonomyces
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-resistance, which is a seedling disease
in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, we just started doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Abby's been potting plants in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try to pot as many of
these seedlings as we can, so about 2,500.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through another
polycross here to produce new half-sib
[SPEAKER_02]: seed families, basically, or grandson
families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to be able to plant swords in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is typical kind of forest
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to go to swords so that we can
evaluate them on a whole plot basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't expect that many of them to
actually produce enough seed to plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: swords.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we further reduce our entry number by
selecting the top seed dealers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, we're going to plant them
in plots in the field, intercropped with a
[SPEAKER_02]: species, intermediate wheatgrass after
there, or maybe in monocultures for the
[SPEAKER_02]: grains.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning of our second year,
this would be the fall of 2019,
[SPEAKER_02]: this fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, we have enough plants that
actually produce seed to make two plots
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can use some sort of partially
replicated design instead of having to use
[SPEAKER_02]: checked varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we move into our beginning of our
third year here, we're starting to,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spring, have our first spring
grazing simulation, like I showed you in
[SPEAKER_02]: that first, our cropping system design.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a summer grazing
harvest and another fall grazing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go through that iteration three
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are planted in monocultures,
space plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to really evaluate things
like leaf area, regrowth rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: fall dormancy, and a variety of
characteristics that we can also use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of it, we can select our
top 1% of our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we're learning about our
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning, is this viable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there certain traits that are better
adapted to this system?
[SPEAKER_02]: And really developing our idiotype through
this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, starting in 2022, I guess fall
2021, we'll take those 100 plants that we
[SPEAKER_02]: selected and begin moving towards the
genomic selection procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start the same way with 100 seeds,
harvest the seeds, and plant those 10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, begin selecting our 100
project each year based on the genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: prediction model that we had developed
previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're designing an idiotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning about the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're phenotyping all these things at the
same time as we go and splitting off into
[SPEAKER_02]: additional cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of having a five-year cycle,
I'm now on a one-year cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll take a portion of these plants
that will become my next training
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over time, basically, I have about
500 plots at my one-year age group,
[SPEAKER_02]: my two-year age group, and the three-year
age group of plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're continually cycling through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't pick a species yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, we have five species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the same time, we're trying to
select species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is really a way to compare
effectiveness in a cropping system,
[SPEAKER_02]: a building in the future to maybe perform
as a grain crop all simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be starting to develop some
genomic tools for these species where,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, cura clover doesn't have markers or
a linkage map or anything yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're developing a linkage map
using capture-seq from rapid genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: while also at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, we'll make a targeted
sequencing panel from the linkage map,
[SPEAKER_02]: choosing markers randomly distributed
across those linkage groups to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted panel for the genotype of the
training population and eventually in
[SPEAKER_02]: these genomic selection models.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, I'd like to
hear them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering how long you envision the
alfalfa to be present in an intercrop
[SPEAKER_06]: system like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like the intermediate wheatgrass
could outlast the alfalfa by quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wondering what you had in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, what we've observed in
intermediate wheatgrass is that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: declining yields after the second,
third year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending where you're at,
it's going to determine how long that crop
[SPEAKER_02]: system is going to be a part of your
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might not have to be more than four
or five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one nice thing about the way we're
imagining it is that we allow time for
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulation of carbohydrates in the root
crowns to increase the persistence of our
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we hope that it's going to stay
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by not actively cutting it the five
times that we would in a normal year,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to help with the system a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, persistence is part of the
selection procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we're really measuring three
years of phenotypic data before we make
[SPEAKER_02]: selections so that we're making sure that
we select plants that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: performing that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things like cura clover, for example,
could be a better candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't really chosen yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cura clover has this rhizomatous growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely persistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might stay there longer in the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But curanza and cura clover both have
these really fibrous above-ground root
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that may end up competing more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might also allow for this interaction
and nitrogen transfer to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're learning that through the
breeding at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect genotypic variability for
the ability to cooperate with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: species in your intergrouping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one of the goals for this sort
of pre-breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant these other varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, we have about 30 varieties
planted of alfalfa, at least, with
[SPEAKER_02]: intermediate wheatgrass around the
country, hoping to see, is there genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: and phenotypic variation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the curanza or intermediate
wheatgrass respond differently when you
[SPEAKER_02]: plant different varieties between them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like the first experiment,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we use the most divergent phenotypic
variation that we have in varieties in
[SPEAKER_02]: that experiment, then there's no
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we have to go the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's something we need to be
selecting for in intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so far, we've observed quite a bit of
variation, and we think breeding is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to work, at least for adaptation to
climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Wisconsin, the alfalfa was
out-competing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Wisconsin and Minnesota both,
the alfalfa was out-competing the
[SPEAKER_02]: intermediate wheatgrass quite a bit in the
establishment year.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Kansas, it was the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at biomass ratios,
the alfalfa to intermediate wheatgrass
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass ratio is like two to one in
Wisconsin and one to two in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we go further and try to figure
out, OK, what is it about these varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: that's causing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fall dormancy seems to be key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in alfalfa, we have this ranges of fall
dormancy that we expect controlled by
[SPEAKER_02]: photo period sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're going to start growing at a
certain time of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grasses have some photo period
sensitivity, but they're also more growing
[SPEAKER_02]: degree dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we accumulate growing degree days
and photo period differently in both
[SPEAKER_02]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can imagine, at some point in time,
making sure we overlap the phenology of
[SPEAKER_02]: those two things just right so that we can
reduce competition or increase
[SPEAKER_02]: compatibility, however you want to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really related to what you were
just talking about, is that what about
[SPEAKER_01]: undesirable species?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're not tilling, what about
weeds, nut grass, all these other kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that incur crop fields?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so far what we've seen, that's a
pretty big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first year of our establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the weeds, when we think about
them in our cropping systems right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: are also annuals that are adapted to using
all the resources really quickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing really quickly in these early
successional ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're finding, to some extent,
is that when you put a big perennial grass
[SPEAKER_02]: there and these other perennial legume
species, especially the rhizomatous ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: they out-compete the weeds really quickly
as we move up this successional gradient
[SPEAKER_02]: in our cropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have problems with things
like trees and with things like other
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial species that don't really take
hold in our cropping systems the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow them right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't had problems with the
Palmer amaranths and the things like that
[SPEAKER_02]: after the first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we don't know what's going to
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the new frontier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can think about continuing to go
along paths or to explore things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've overlooked as humans for the last
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of overlooked this idea of
having perennial grain crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's somewhere that when we see how
things function in our earth systems right
[SPEAKER_02]: now that we need to begin exploring in
more detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the perennial lupine idea is
kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that for annual lupine production
there's issues with anti-nutritionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking at lupines,
is this something you would want to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at sooner rather than later because it's
such a big potential roadblock to grain
[SPEAKER_03]: usage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we are starting collaborations.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little circle diagram I was showing
you, we're actually phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing some mass spec work to look at
the alkaloid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's alkaloids and lupines that are
toxic to mammals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that's really
interesting about it, so we had three
[SPEAKER_02]: species of lupines that were domesticated
and eaten for thousands of years with the
[SPEAKER_02]: alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are water soluble and heat
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a processing step to
removing the alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were kind of nice to have there
because they provide sort of anti
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivory in those cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've now used mutagenesis three times
and removed the alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since this pathway basically doesn't
function anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lupines that we're cultivating
now, especially in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the lupines in Australia are non
bitter types, the sweet types.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't produce alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, we still have a lot of the
bitter types that are grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you buy like lupini beans in
Italy or in Palestine where those are all
[SPEAKER_02]: actually soaked for multiple days before
they're fed to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question to think
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm starting breeding potential
new species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something that I should get rid of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that something that I should take
advantage of in designing this crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what sort of food system do you need
to have to control that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in Australia, they have a law that
you can only have the non bitter types
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't want anyone to have the
chance of eating something that is high in
[SPEAKER_02]: alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, there's no laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so everything has to be processed this
kind of the same way treated like they
[SPEAKER_02]: might have alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all these fascinating things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we talk about high value
products, alkaloids are important for
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal uses and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there might be a whole industries
about actually taking the alkaloids out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lupines and using them as a secondary
product and using the proteins for human
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have one on Zoom?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a question from Chris Smallwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some challenges you face with
product development using these perennial
[SPEAKER_04]: crops and what are some successes you've
had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done no product development so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is because I'm still trying to
decide what we're going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have been doing product development
for other grains at the land institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So intermediate wheatgrass is in this
pre-commercialization stage under the
[SPEAKER_02]: name, the grain sold under the name
Kernza.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just hired a commercialization
manager to oversee that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, there's way more demand than
supply available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in this unique state of time
where there's so much demand that we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: produce enough seed for farmers to plant
because we're trying to have income to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the research and et cetera by
selling the grain to people to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully what we imagine is that
people begin valuing, like the plant-based
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins that we were talking about,
people begin valuing things because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: impact that they have on our environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can pay a premium for those things
in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do a whole lot of food safety
research before I can release anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the current intermediate wheatgrass has
gone through iterative rounds of applying
[SPEAKER_02]: for these kind of generally regarded as
safe ingredients so that they can be
[SPEAKER_02]: registered for use in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfalfa is a really nice candidate also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lupins are because there's already
lupins there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they already have some of those
statuses, which hopefully helps someday in
[SPEAKER_02]: that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking about how you might transition
from annual systems to these more diverse
[SPEAKER_04]: perennial systems, how do you think is the
best strategy to go about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of compromises are you willing
to make?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are you trying to maybe leverage
in doing so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so one of the reasons that we're
pushing towards these dual use forage
[SPEAKER_02]: grain systems is that we are compromising
right now releasing intermediate
[SPEAKER_02]: wheatgrass as a grain crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to achieve the same yields
as wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing respectable amounts if there's a
premium value for the grain is one way to
[SPEAKER_02]: move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the compromises we're going to
make is probably in the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the way it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about wheat, it's got like
a 10,000 year head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to envision, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 2050 is this number that we throw out
about how are we going to feed people in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2050.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need to think about feeding
people in 2100 and 2150.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are we going to do to solve these
problems that are pressing right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have upset biogeochemical
systems in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start thinking about those
problems as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I don't release something,
if there's no perennial legume crop in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next 10 years, I don't know if that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need them at some point in time,
and someone needs to start working on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it definitely has to not be a me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be a we.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's no chance that any of
these perennial legume species can exist
[SPEAKER_02]: or perennial grain crops, et cetera,
without having a larger scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: public, and private interest and
investment in the development of these
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, with that, let's thank Brandon again.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
