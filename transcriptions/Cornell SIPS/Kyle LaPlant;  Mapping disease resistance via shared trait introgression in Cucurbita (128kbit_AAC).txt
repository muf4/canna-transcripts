[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name's Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the Missouri lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be continuing our
discussion on disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will be talking about mapping
disease resistance genes in key curbit of
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk today a little bit
about two different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about resistance to
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, the viruses that I'm
working with are cucumber mosaic virus and
[SPEAKER_00]: then three podiviruses, papaya ringspot,
watermelon mosaic, and zucchini yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I will be talking about our
work in mapping powder mildew resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically this gene PM0.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work is being done in key curbit of
PEEPO, which is the species that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: things like zucchini, summer squash,
some winter squash, pumpkins, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this species is very important
for all of these market classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there really aren't a lot of resistance
genes to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no native resistance to any of
these diseases in key curbit of PEEPO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that, breeders have been
forced to go to other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For virus resistance, the most common
source of resistance for those four
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses are coming from Nigerian local and
manina.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two old, old varieties of key
curbit of moshata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key curbit of moshata is like a butternut
squash, tropical pumpkin, that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can cross pretty well with key
curbit of PEEPO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been, in the past, it's been used
to bring in those disease resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people also use this variety called
Whitaker, which is an interesting variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: named for this man, Thomas Whitaker,
a famous key curbit geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has resistance that has been
brought into a key curbit of PEEPO
[SPEAKER_00]: species, but it's from three related wild
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a very interesting pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have been using this as a
bridge, so they don't have to try to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: with all these crazy wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very rarely, people are using key
curbit of equidorensis, which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those related wild species that is much
more difficult to cross with, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: have resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get started on this, I was looking
for any variety that was listed as having
[SPEAKER_00]: some resistance to any of these viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a pretty good collection of
mostly key curbit of PEEPO, some moshata,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of different market classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, for our two most
important viruses, CMV and PRSV,
[SPEAKER_00]: there just aren't that many resistant
cultivars available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing moving forward is
evaluating these and trying to pick the
[SPEAKER_00]: best ones to start developing segregating
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can move forward with that and have
more recombination there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the bottom two, WMV, ZYMV,
at least we have a few more varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: there, so we can start doing more mapping
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just zoom in and talk
about just one of these viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: papaya ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a devastating disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes just terrible fruit deformation,
and then the plants are stunted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody wants to buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could eat it, but if you went to a
store, nobody's going to buy something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm focusing on this one because it is
unique in that it's one of the podiviruses
[SPEAKER_00]: that, in the past, resistance has been
described by a single recessive gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought is that the most likely
candidate gene for this is this EIF4E,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a translation initiation factor
that interacts directly with the five
[SPEAKER_00]: prime cap of mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown in other species that
mutations in this gene will result in a
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive resistance to mostly
podiviruses, so that's encouraging,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a few other classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little cartoon of how this
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EIF4E is part of this whole translation
initiation complex, and it binds directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to this genome-associated viral protein
that is acting as the five prime cap for
[SPEAKER_00]: virus RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is a mutation in this protein
and it can't bind properly, then this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole complex doesn't form, and
translation doesn't happen, and the virus
[SPEAKER_00]: can't spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward with that, I'm just
looking for any possible candidate genes
[SPEAKER_00]: from other transcriptomic work that have
been identified in cucurbitous species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to start sequencing those
genes, looking for any polymorphism that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be leading to these mutations that
would interfere and inhibit this binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also working to develop more
mapping populations and doing more
[SPEAKER_00]: screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so changing gears a little bit,
I'm going to talk a little bit now about
[SPEAKER_00]: powder mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps some of you remember Bill
Holdsworth talking about this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have mapped the major powder mildew
resistance gene that's present in most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivars that are available today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an introgression mapping approach
where we knew that this resistance came
[SPEAKER_00]: from one particular wild species,
and it happened in one introgression
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to find this candidate
interval of about 500 kb that all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant varieties shared and none of the
susceptible varieties had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with additional fine mapping,
we got that down to about 76 kb,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we developed a marker that was
predictive in cucurbitous people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep going with this, we really
wanted to figure out what is the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: gene involved and what causal polymorphism
is happening, because right now our marker
[SPEAKER_00]: is just sort of tagging this
introgression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, I was working through this
analysis again, and I redid what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: using the new Moschata genome that's
available, which is much more complete
[SPEAKER_00]: than the PIPO reference that we were using
initially, and found one strong signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is confirming what we found using
the other reference genome, so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I zoomed in on that region,
looking at about 80 kb, and we have about
[SPEAKER_00]: a dozen or so possible genes in here that
have annotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two in particular that I
really want to focus in on, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: this MBS-LR gene and this powder mildew
resistance protein that has the RPW8
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these, if it's going to be any of
these, this is where I want to put most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my effort, because this MBS-LR gene is a
very common R gene for a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and the powder mildew resistance
protein with the RPW8 domain is very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to powder mildew, and it's been
shown in a few other species that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is causing resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really get into this, for these two
candidate genes, we've been doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, did some RT-PCR, and we found
that they are expressed in both the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant and susceptible varieties,
so there must be something else going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just presence-absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to do additional
sequencing and using RACE to pull out the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire sequence of these genes from both
resistant and susceptible varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're looking for polymorphism that
could be leading to this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we are a little bit more
confident that one of these two genes is
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely our best candidate,
then we're thinking about moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: with either a virus-induced gene silencing
technique to knock out the expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene in the resistant plant,
try to bring it down to a susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: level, or possibly using any
transformation techniques that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: like an ultimate confirmation that our
candidate gene is in fact the causal gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to just thank the
members of the Mazurik lab, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: Paige Reeves, for all her help with the
powder mildew work, my committee members,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my funding through QCAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been allowing me to really dig into
some of these different, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different diseases, which are really
important to the Cucurbit community at
[SPEAKER_00]: large, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, you know, there isn't a lot of
work done in Cucurbits yet using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one that has been shown to work at
least in proof of concept is, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like Apple spherical latent virus,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been shown at least to work in
proof of concept, but not a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: has been done using VIGS in Cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be something that if I
wanted to use at first, we'd have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this system working and then go from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sounds kind of fun to me,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, it's present all throughout
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure where it came from,
but it also can affect papayas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's that same sort of virus,
but it pretty much infects papayas and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Cucurbits and not a whole lot else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like CMV that can infect like a
thousand different things.
Yes?
So that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of redundancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the cell has other like different
versions of this, it could still function
[SPEAKER_00]: normally and it might just be that there's
specific EFRE virus interactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't working, but with the cap protein
of the mRNA that's in plant cells that's
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different than this viral cap
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that interaction might not work with
the virus, but it could still work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mRNA from the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty common mechanism of
resistance to recessive viruses like that.
Thank you.
