[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any local effects of extreme
weather and climate change in the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially because you're native here to
Dutchess County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the winters are getting much
milder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more severe weather as we head
south seems to be getting more snow,
[SPEAKER_00]: more cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winters are not nearly as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had three major weather events in
the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two years ago, the excessive snow
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last fall with the, you know, being hit by
tremendous amounts of rain, the hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this winter with, I don't ever
recall a winter of this as easy as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through snowless winters,
but never with as mild as it's been.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a winter, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot less hay was fed,
a lot less hay was used, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for those that didn't have to
buy hay, but it's poor for those of us
[SPEAKER_00]: that sell hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the insect population and the bad
bugs that weren't killed in today's paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a major thing about Lyme disease
being perhaps the banner year for Lyme
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really concerned over what's coming
down the road, even though I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only hope that things won't be as
dire as they may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to your farm during the
extreme weather events and how much money
[SPEAKER_01]: you think you lost, how did it affect you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it started in April last year
with the fact that we had so much trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the crops in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, we got them seeded and we
couldn't even go back and roll them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll them and pick up rock, which in turn
we probably got a poorer catch of seed
[SPEAKER_00]: than we should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bothered us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just little things that,
you know, don't always add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you have to send people
again and again back to the field because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big wet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go around and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost probably half our old crop because
we couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't harvest it in the window that
we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing that's bothering me
right today is that we left probably
[SPEAKER_00]: $15,000 worth of hay, second-cutting grass
hay, in the field that we could not
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest last fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made many attempts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some in, but we knew a lot of hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we left $15,000 worth of hay in the
field, which is really financially
[SPEAKER_00]: bothering me right now, strapping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost a field of corn that was,
you know, a lot of it was management fault
[SPEAKER_00]: for not chopping that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left it for grain, thought we could get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the late snow storm and it was
very tall corn and it took it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost, we lost a lot of corn over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably lost a minimum of 40,000 or
so in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, as a farmer, you can weather the
storm, but you can't weather continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it on the chin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you know, you come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring brings eternal hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, as a farmer, that's what fuels
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, you know, as I become alive,
I mean, this winter, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the warm weather comes, we all feel
like doing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a farmer, it's just so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we think again this year,
I have, this is, probably skewed vision
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is going to be the best year
ever.
