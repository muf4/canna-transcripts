[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my name is Alyssa de Villiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a third year MS PhD student in the lab
of Dr. Carmen and Ede Martinez,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm really excited to share my
research with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna try using this clicky thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first I'd like to acknowledge my
committee members, Dr. Nicole Benedict,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Natalie Capiro, and our collaborators,
Dr. Christy Goodale and her amazing lab
[SPEAKER_01]: group in ecology and evolutionary biology,
and also Dr. Taryn Bowerly in
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the lab group I'm in,
all the great members of it, and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly Anid, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been lucky to receive funding through
the USDA for the first two years of my
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm recently funded through the
Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate research grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to give you a general idea of how I
anticipate my degree going, the first two
[SPEAKER_01]: chapters will be based on my master's
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: This involves acidification and nitrogen
addition in forest soils and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects on the water extractable
fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next two chapters that I'm
proposing for my dissertation will shift
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at cellulose decomposition and
trying to link enzymatic breakdown with
[SPEAKER_01]: this technique that Anid mentioned of
density functional theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diving right in to the master's
project, as I said, this is looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification and nitrogen addition in
forest soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while our collaborators in the Goodale
lab group are looking at ecosystem fluxes
[SPEAKER_01]: of carbon and nitrogen, and the Bowerly
group is looking at below ground carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: allocation and root exudates, we're
focused on the soil solution or what comes
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the soil into water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our hypothesis was that dissolved
organic matter, composition, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: sorption to soil minerals to form mineral
associated organic matter would be altered
[SPEAKER_01]: by nitrogen addition and acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an important issue because,
as probably many of you know, we've had
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification and nitrogen addition going
on for quite a long time in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see on the right here is global
sulfur emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the combustion of fossil
fuels, and particularly coal, we started
[SPEAKER_01]: having an increase in the 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you see, I think I can,
here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see here is around 1950,
we have a sharp acceleration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down here, this is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in black is atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is nitrogen sources in the
Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that same pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the 1950s, we have a big
acceleration of atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see it peaking around 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happened then was essentially
the Clean Air Act started regulating
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur and nitrogen emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on this picture, what we see is that
through the combustion of fossil fuels,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are
released to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through dry or wet deposition,
they get distributed across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that conclures acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cause nitrogen addition,
which itself can cause acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we might have other sources
of nitrogen addition, like ammonia
[SPEAKER_01]: volatization or runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see in that graph,
we've actually already peaked on those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those regulations worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they helped to bring it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this only is showing until 2000 in
that top graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those numbers continue to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually what we're seeing now that's
more important than the effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification is really what's going to
happen as we recover from acidification
[SPEAKER_01]: and recover from nitrogen addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to see what effects we have on
the soil from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them that can be happening is
that more dissolved organic matter can
[SPEAKER_01]: leave the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can cause lake browning,
where the water is getting more organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter and more color in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that in turn affects the aquatic
life in streams and lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also we are thinking about soil health in
terms of losing nutrients or retaining
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And climate change, if we have more carbon
coming off into the soils, it's possible
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbes would be able to respire
that out as CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might lose that from the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of frames what we're thinking
about in this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The setup we used to look at this was
actually pretty exciting, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been happening for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I was involved with the project,
these were already treatment conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: that were set up in sites around Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a control treatment with no
amendment, an acidified treatment where
[SPEAKER_01]: elemental sulfur was added, a nitrogen
addition treatment where nitrate has been
[SPEAKER_01]: added, and an acidified plus nitrogen
addition treatment where ammonium sulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: has been added.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea there is that some effects
might be from both acidification and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, but some might be from just
acidification or just nitrogen addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to call each of those
treatments a plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plot was 40 meters by 40 meters with a
10 meter buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing to know here is
that those treatments were each replicated
[SPEAKER_01]: six times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 24 total plots distributed at
three sites around Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, these are forested
hillsides that are silt, loam,
[SPEAKER_01]: and septisols.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some pretty big variations
in organic matter and pH at these
[SPEAKER_01]: different sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do take that into account when we're
doing the statistical analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: At each of these plots, soils were sampled
in five locations and composited to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plot level and then sieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And four depths were taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the forest floor, which I'm
going to call the O horizon, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty shallow depths, so 0 to 3
centimeters, just the first top inch of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 to 10 centimeters and 10 to 20
centimeters, which all fall into the A
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down here in this graph, this is just
to show that we did have acidification in
[SPEAKER_01]: the treatments we expected to acidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So acidify only brought the pH of the
forest floor down to an average of 3 and 1
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really quite acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point in the study, these soils
that I'm looking at are from 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only saw a small effect of pH in the
acidify plus N condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also important to note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we look at the 0 to 3
centimeters top inch of soil, both acidify
[SPEAKER_01]: plus nitrogen addition and acidify are
bringing the pH to around 4.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to ground everybody in what
kind of pHs we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: because some of them are really quite
acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was not involved in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved in the soil sample
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these samples, as I said,
were composited, sieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it to me, so here's where I come
into the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I receive that soil, and I shake it with
water, and then filter it to less than two
[SPEAKER_01]: microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what we have is this water soluble
fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that's going to come off the
soil into the water, sometimes we might
[SPEAKER_01]: think of this as the dissolved organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our first objective is to find out
what's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as many of you will know, it can be
very hard to find out the exact compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to pick some analyses to
give us an idea of what's in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's that characterization step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you think about that water moving
through the soil, and now it's picked up
[SPEAKER_01]: various different things into it,
now it's going to start interacting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part to simulate that is a
batch experiment, where we take that
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved organic matter and shake it with
minerals that are found in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the assumption here is that you have
some amount of, say, carbon or nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shake it with a mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: You re-measure the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever amount that's decreased,
that has been absorbed or stuck to those
[SPEAKER_01]: soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've completed the experiment,
but not this variable importance,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to be the next aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea there is to say, what factors
are controlling how much carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically is sticking to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these different soil minerals?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, objective three is ATR,
FTIR, flow-through experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing to know here is
we're going to take a soil mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to add some organic matter on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to create what we call MAOM,
or mineral-associated organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to run root exudates
off of that and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So root exudates can push off organic
matter, possibly off minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe they'll get stuck themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one really important thing to remember
the whole time I'm talking, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: probably people in this room mostly
already know this, but I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about bulk soil or the carbon and nitrogen
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the carbon and nitrogen
in the water that comes into contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I might call this the water soluble
fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could call it the soil solution or the
aqueous phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I might talk about soluble carbon and
water extractable nutrients, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that it's all in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why we care about this fraction is
because it's highly mobile, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: responsive to environmental changes,
and it's available to plants and microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: without a lot of additional effort on
their part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I have all these arrows is not to
say, oh, I've gotten every single input or
[SPEAKER_01]: output of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to illustrate that if we find
that we have more or less of something in
[SPEAKER_01]: that water soluble fraction, it could be
for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's because we have more input.
[SPEAKER_01]: But equally, it could be because we have
fewer outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of, as usual with soil,
is a mess for trying to determine exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: why something's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just keep that in mind for when we see
an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jumping right into the results,
I'm going to start in the O horizon and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about dissolved organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here on the left, we see that all of
our treatments reduced the carbon coming
[SPEAKER_01]: off the soil at this point, which is 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A decade into the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we want to see what can we say
about that carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just saying the amount of carbon is
pretty general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one measurement type we can get is
aromaticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aromaticity, you can think of as
sometimes people think of these benzene
[SPEAKER_01]: rings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's where you have bonds where
electrons are shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to make the molecules more
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if it is a complex system,
then it can add more color to those
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see here is that the only
treatment that had an effect was our
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that lowered aromaticity of the
dissolved organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now moving to this graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of a proxy measurement for
size or molecular weight of molecules in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is acidification alone is
the only condition that had an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And its effect is, if we follow this arrow
up, to make molecules smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start to get this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we can see down here, if we imagine
these little brown balls as dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: organic carbon, that when we acidify,
what's coming off the soil is less in
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not showing the box by here,
but it also has a trend of less color.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, when we add nitrogen,
we still see less dissolved organic
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon, but no change in size or metis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first, I thought, oh, the
nitrogen's having a modifying effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: the acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember that in this O horizon,
that acidify plus end treatment actually
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't that acidified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, based on the fact that size,
aromaticity, and color in the O horizon
[SPEAKER_01]: have a linear correlation to pH,
what we're actually seeing is just an
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why might this be happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we get into,
I'm just giving you some ideas on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody else is welcome to add their
ideas in at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be biotic and abiotic
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why might we have less input of DOC into
our water soluble fraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with nitrogen addition, it's been
shown that there's fewer root exudates
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the trees are getting enough
on their own of their requirements met
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe they don't need to be enhancing
the system to their benefit in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatively, maybe we're retaining more
of the DOC on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have acidification,
that is going to take oxygens with
[SPEAKER_01]: negative charges that are in solution and
add a proton to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're not going to be negatively
charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tends to reduce repulsive
interactions between organic-organic
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions we'd be talking about in the
O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could mean that more is
retained and less is coming off into
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then in terms of the smaller size in
the acidification treatment, a biotic
[SPEAKER_01]: reason might be that at that really low pH
of 3, 3.5, we could be inhibiting
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a little bit is happening,
but they're just knocking off a few number
[SPEAKER_01]: that are just small bits off the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then an opposite idea would be that,
in fact, larger molecules are coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of that acidic pH,
they're broken down into smaller molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly, abiotically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the type of thought process
we're going through when we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, the implications,
and this is really something that other
[SPEAKER_01]: studies have found also and is really
important, is that as we recover from
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification, the opposite effect can
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that we would have more DOC
coming off soils, but also that it's made
[SPEAKER_01]: up of larger and more aromatic molecules
with more color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why that matters is that idea of
lake browning that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have more DOC coming off and also
it's more aromatic per unit of carbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can impart more color to waterways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that other people
are finding and researching actively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we see that nitrogen addition
also reduced the total amount of dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: organic carbon, it seems like that the
recovery from nitrogen addition could add
[SPEAKER_01]: to the effects of the recovery from
acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, straight from carbon to nitrogen,
all the important players here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this top left box plot, we see total
dissolved nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And acidification plus nitrogen is
reducing total nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And acidification has a trend of
reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so then we want to think,
well, what kind of nitrogen are we talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, we're looking at inorganic
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrate and ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see something pretty interesting,
although not wholly unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in purple is the acidification only
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see is that this is for
nitrate in that graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see is in the O horizon,
there is no water extractable nitrate at
[SPEAKER_01]: all coming off of these soils under
acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go down into the top inch of
soil, there's still almost none.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we don't see an effect for the
other treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on this graph, this is ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see is that there's a little
increase in ammonium under acidification
[SPEAKER_01]: and a decrease in ammonium in
acidification plus nitrogen addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're adding nitrogen in that condition
as ammonium, you might think, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're adding ammonium to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammonium might go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, pictorially, you can see that the
ammonium in acidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero percent nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in the acidification plus
nitrogen, we have a little reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium and increase in nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why might that be happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the major bacteria that we
need to think about when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium and nitrate is nitrifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably, there is at least some role
going on here for why we're seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be a number of reasons that
we're losing that nitrate in acidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a microbial reason would be that even
though nitrifiers can operate at some
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic pHs, again, we're really acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's possible that we're seeing
inhibition of nitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the ammonium is accumulating and
not being converted to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also could have more output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I'm sure these two are
working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from abiotically speaking, nitrate is
an anion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to stick to negatively
charged soil particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just going to have loss from the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as acidification pushes out base
cations and those leads to the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate is a good companion to exit with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we could have more output due to
chemo denitrification or self
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition of nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm actually going to talk about
this one at the same time, because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: still in the acidification treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we add protons or hydrogen ions to
the solution, that might also push off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absorbed ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some reasons that would
explain what we see in acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about in the acidify plus N?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we have that decrease in
ammonium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, my idea is that maybe we have
an increase in nitrifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to process that ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saying, here's your substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're adding it every single year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they're pretty good at
processing that and continually putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out nitrate into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really need that kind of
continuous input of nitrate, because
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's not going to be retained in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either going to be taken up by plants
or leached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen is that water
extractable nitrate was completely absent
[SPEAKER_01]: after a decade of acidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the nitrogen addition,
but the acidity that is the major factor
[SPEAKER_01]: influencing nitrogen speciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to move out of the O
horizon and into the mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a new player in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this first graph is showing is the
relationship between aluminum and
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a known relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, not wildly surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the important thing to
emphasize here is we don't see a
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship in the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aluminum's really not playing a role,
even though we have those really acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: soils in the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we get down, even an inch down,
all of a sudden we see that correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving to this graph on the upper
right, this is showing size or apparent
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular weight on the y-axis to aluminum
on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what we're seeing is that
aluminum's really not affecting the O
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon, and very essentially not in the
first inch of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we get down a little deeper,
to 3 to 10 centimeters, as we increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum, molecules are getting larger in
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times we see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times people talk about cation
bridging, which is the idea that a
[SPEAKER_01]: positively charged particle with more than
one positive charge could essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: mediate between two negatively charged
carbon-containing molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have two carboxylic acids with
negative charges, and you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a calcium with a charge of plus 2 in
the middle, it's kind of making everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: play nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making it so that you can have a
little less space between those negative
[SPEAKER_01]: charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aluminum is a plus 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could expect that the same thing
might be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could be evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on this bottom graph, this is showing
aromaticity again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a relationship between
aromaticity and size in the O horizon and
[SPEAKER_01]: the top inch of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once we get to 3 to 10
centimeters, we see a steeper slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's saying, as we have more
aromatic molecules, they're larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start to get this picture where
there's more aluminum in solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: more carbon in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are larger molecules with more
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have these larger when there's more
aromaticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why would we care about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next part is leading into the batch
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we have an idea of what's maybe
making larger molecules, which tend to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down on mineral surfaces more,
and we get the sense that aluminum is
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a role in that, and we get a sense
of how much carbon we have in solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: now we want to know, how is it going to
stick to the rest of the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for this, we move to objective 2,
which is the batch experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I extracted dissolved organic
matter from the 0 to 3 centimeter layer
[SPEAKER_01]: and then shook it with Gurtite,
an iron oxide hydroxide, kaolinite,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 1 to 1 aluminum silicate clay,
gibbsite, and aluminum hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the 3 to 10 centimeter soil,
which I'm not going to show the results of
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this graph, which is, again,
I'm only going to show one result from
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still processing the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this graph, I think, is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is aluminum sorbed on the x-axis and
organic carbon sorbed on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just look at the amount of
organic carbon sorbed to the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see, as expected, kaolinite is really
not absorbing very much carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then gibbsite and Gurtite are
absorbing at least in the same order of
[SPEAKER_01]: magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting part is we saw that
aluminum association with carbon in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, but now we're still seeing it on
what's been sorbed, so what's left the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution once we shake it with those
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be a couple reasons we
might be seeing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this bottom one is saying here's
aluminum associating with organic
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules in solution, just like we saw
maybe on that previous slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a key absorption to the
iron and Gurtite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of all helping it come
together, kind of co-sorbing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or alternatively, maybe aluminum first
absorbs to the Gurtite and then allows for
[SPEAKER_01]: more organic compounds to pile on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way, we're going to be
investigating what's going on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing whether we can see particularly we
can look for this bond here of iron-oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we'll be continuing to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, that's going to wrap up the
master's project discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll move on to what I'm proposing for
my dissertation proposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is still relevant in forest
soils, I'm actually mentally shifting more
[SPEAKER_01]: to agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we talk about soil health and
nutrient cycling and how to build soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health, which is something really
important to me as a small farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing we noticed is one way is to
add plant matter and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does all that plant matter have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how that cellulose breaks down and
how it interacts, how quickly it breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: down, is going to affect that nutrient
cycling through the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to look at five factors on
cellulose decomposition, pH, enzyme and
[SPEAKER_01]: cellulose concentration, the presence of
three soil minerals, probably the ones I
[SPEAKER_01]: just showed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The presence of low molecular weight
organic molecules, like amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the presence of a divalent
cation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in agricultural systems, calcium is
probably the one we'd want to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: because obviously when you're liming,
you're adding calcium to soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, could these different
factors affect how quickly cellulose is
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling?
[SPEAKER_01]: And inspiration for this comes from the
way cellulose enzymes work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, this is cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made up of chains of glucose monomers
called fibrils that are then hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: bonded together in this actually rigid
crystalline structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to break it down, you need three
different types of enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: endoglucanases, exoglucanases,
and beta-glucostidases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of an exoglucanase
cell 7A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a molecular dynamics simulation of
the,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a molecular simulation of that
enzyme at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see is that here, it's picking
up a fibril off the cellulose surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be knocking off two and
three chunks of cellulose at a time off
[SPEAKER_01]: the back end here out of the catalytic
domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has this flexible linker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the front, it has a carbohydrate
binding module, which they sometimes call
[SPEAKER_01]: a foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's anchoring that enzyme to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important part of the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this foot, we can see it zoomed in
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got three amino acid residues that
are helping it bind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are tyrosine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, this is going to be
processing along the cellulose surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down these little units as it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if it hits an obstacle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we think of absorption and
protective absorption, some ways that we
[SPEAKER_01]: might see that for the cellulose enzyme
would be the enzyme could bind to a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral and then knock be able to get to
cellulose and break it down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe the cellulose could bind to a
mineral and then not be available for the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another type that I want to
investigate is, what if something binds to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cellulose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what if a couple tyrosines come in
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could they bind?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would that then block the process of
this enzyme moving down the surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to test that, I have these eight
different treatment conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to shake each of them with
cellulose to allow any interference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interactions that are going to happen to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll add an enzyme mix from a
fungus called trichodamer racy that has
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to break down the cellulose
all the way to glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can measure glucose as a
function of time and see how much
[SPEAKER_01]: cellulose is being broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea would be, we assume that in
some of these conditions, you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: protective absorption of different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can investigate what we see
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, for objective two,
I'd like to link this technique called
[SPEAKER_01]: density functional theory and see if we
can get it to be predictive in a slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: more macro scale of enzymatic breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that might look like is in density
functional theory, which is based on
[SPEAKER_01]: quantum mechanics and models electron
configurations, we can model a surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a mineral surface or the cellulose
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can model a molecule,
like an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can put them together and see
how they bind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question is, and I don't know
the answer, but can we, if we can
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately, by corroborating it with
laboratory experiments, if we can
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately predict which molecules are
going to bind more strongly, can we use
[SPEAKER_01]: that to predict whether or not,
say, an enzyme is going to have trouble
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking something down?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the idea with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it's exciting is, partly because
it's high throughput.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you model your surface,
you can model a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, again, you have to corroborate
the results with your laboratory results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this question,
could it be predictive?
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be pretty exciting if we could
measure a cellulose surface, measure how
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly something bound to it,
and that correlated to how efficient the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that would be possible,
but that'd be exciting, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's everything I wanted to share
with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate everybody coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johannes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Alissa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great data and wonderfully presented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some nitty-gritty questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you're filtering your DOC at
0.22.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil scientists usually do 0.45.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aquatic scientists 0.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why 0.2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that the goal with all the
filtering is to make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting microfiltering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not getting microbial biomass,
but also not getting fine soil particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we just chose 0.2 to make
sure we weren't getting anything in that
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are some things between 0.2
and 0.4, particularly colloidal bits.
[SPEAKER_03]: For LC-MS, we're doing 0.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just wondering whether there was
some other reason that I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to remember the chart of
the different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember at some point looking at
it, and that's what we chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always interesting how the different
fields are using different cut-offs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might lose a little bit that's in
that range of 0.2 to 0.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you look at, do you think sulfur
plays a role in all of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you honed in on the nitrogen
acidity, but then there's sulfur as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you fundamentally change
when you add sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also with the historic emissions that
it changes organic sulfur forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm sure it plays a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sulfur can be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's redox reactions going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, when we add the elemental
sulfur, it's primarily acidifying by
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a lot of sulfur cycling
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we were not well set up
to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sulfur in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a lot to say about it,
but that's definitely an important role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know some other papers are
looking at sulfate concentrations also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the counter ion for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, what could be a counter ion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily nitrate and sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The aluminum component is basically
acidifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going from this Gibbs identity of these
ionic state aluminums, but with the pH,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you decrease the pH, you're increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accelerating aluminum.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, certainly from a concept of
recovery from acidification, what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: tag there that this is what we're going to
see is recovery, rather than this is just
[SPEAKER_02]: more, we're not, it's no more acid rain in
a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the BPA, but still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that's something I'm
really interested in thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if other people have this
problem, but I find my mind can go round
[SPEAKER_01]: and round in these sort of different
circles of, oh, maybe it'd be this way,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe it would happen this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it depends what role aluminum is
playing in the adsorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not seeing it in the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the research out there that's
similar, that's looking at that runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: into streams and Lake Browning is talking
about what's coming from the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the O horizon is not going to be
a source of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be going into the soil
and then interacting with aluminum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just running off the surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's in the soil, I would expect
that what we're seeing is more aluminum is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually helping it stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would expect that as the pH goes up,
that it would reduce aluminum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that that could also exacerbate losing
more carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I was looking at it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're thinking it's more like a
spodasol than the inceptosols that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's that experiment that's up
on Turkey Hill or Game Farm, we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Farm, up to Mount Pleasant,
that they actually put the trees in place
[SPEAKER_02]: to see if the, I mean, because it's the O
horizon, these are the acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the organic material that's coming from
these trees are actually creating the
[SPEAKER_02]: spodic horizons, which would then be these
VHS and VHS as farther down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I looked at those numbers that
you were saying, this is the A horizon,
[SPEAKER_02]: those aren't A horizons, you've got an A
horizon that's maybe this thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like the soil series, they consider
it AP, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, depends on how you want to
think about it, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's all effectively
been disturbed soil at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that thinking about how the
recovery of acidification will affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum is important, and whether
something like calcium or a different
[SPEAKER_01]: divalent cation could sort of take over
some of that bridging role would be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, but not something we're at
yet, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so then another applause, and I will
see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
