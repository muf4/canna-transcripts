[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're logged into the fifth of six
strawberry webinars sponsored by the North
[SPEAKER_00]: American Strawberry Growers Association
and hosted by Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Horticulture and Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kathy Heidenreich and I will be
your moderator for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be starting in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to point out to you,
if you were not able to see last week's
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars by Mr. Steve Koike and Dr. Tracy
Leske, you can go to the webinar link here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the web links box and they have both
been recorded and are there for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to at your convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Leske was kind enough to provide some
information in response to a question by
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the participants about trap
construction for brown marmorated stink
[SPEAKER_00]: bug and the availability of commercial
traps and those documents are down here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the files box.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pyramid trap construction is a plan to
build your own and you can download those
[SPEAKER_00]: files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the file and then click download
and the other is some information about a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial trap that's being distributed
by AgBio.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first speaker today is Dr. Robert
Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob is research plant pathologist with the
USDA ARS Horticultural Crops Research Unit
[SPEAKER_00]: in Corvallis, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works on virus diseases of small fruit
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob serves as research leader for the unit
which has 66 permanent employees including
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 research scientists and is a courtesy
professor in the Department of Botany and
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Pathology at Oregon State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research in Bob's lab focuses on
characterization, detection and management
[SPEAKER_00]: of viruses in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one of the few laboratories that
concentrate on viruses in these crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: he is involved in research on berry crops
in most U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: production areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, Bob's research focuses on virus
complexes and how to control virus
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases in berry crops in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: His lab is also involved in the National
Clean Plant Network and serves as one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the centers for producing virus tested
materials that are then made available to
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob works closely with growers and
presents his research and his applications
[SPEAKER_00]: to grower groups throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for signing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about viruses which is
my favorite topic in case you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: heard me speak before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the only thing I give talks
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom here is my email and
phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to get more information
afterwards, feel free to send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just my first and last name with a
dot and then that is ARSUSDA.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, with that we will get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I start, I would like to
acknowledge the people involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: project in case I run out of time at the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yanis Chanatakis is a former student and
post-doc in my lab now at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Arkansas, Fayetteville and works on
viruses in berry crops and has talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, did a lot of this work when he was
in my lab and is working on doing a lot on
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberries right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pamela is a student that was in my lab
from Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next four people are, five people are
technicians that have been in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right hand side we have
collaborators, Mark Bolden, Dan Markham
[SPEAKER_01]: from the UC Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both involved with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Wintermantle at Salinas with ARS did
the white fly transmission work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Sweeney was our co-operator up in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some of the material we'll be
talking about from the germ plasma
[SPEAKER_01]: repository and we have samples sent from a
lot of different locations around North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have at any one time we have
between four and six undergrads working in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab that actually keep everything
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wouldn't be able to do this without
funding from a number of sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course the USDA pays my salary and some
of the technician's salaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The California, British Columbia,
North American strawberry growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Oregon and Washington growers and then
the Northwest Center for Small Fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get funding from a number of
different sources which is necessary to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the program running at the size we
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case you feel left out,
feel free to contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a significant donation and
have your name added to that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strawberry viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most strawberry cultivars that are grown
today will not show any symptoms if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're infected by a single virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the cultivars we grow won't
show symptoms if they're infected with two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three viruses depending on what those
viruses are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the breeders have been doing a pretty
good job about developing tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the drawback to that is if you have a
tolerant cultivar, you have one plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: has virus A, one with B and C.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the nursery they're all symptomless and
over time those will get mixed together
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can then get disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visual symptoms usually, like I said,
don't develop unless there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation of viruses and some of the
material we'll see later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see those symptoms until we had
four viruses present.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use indicator plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indicator plants are really only used
in the certification and the Clean Plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Network Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really sort of our gold standard to
pick up unknowns or to detect viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: where we don't have good lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also is a backup for any lab tests
that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we used to call severe strains of
viruses, and I'll show you one of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: now that we have good lab tests and good
characterization we realize that many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these, actually I think all of these that
we've looked at now are actually mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: infections rather than severe infections
or severe isolates of a specific virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just examples of grafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top we have strawberry mild yellow
wedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the lower part strawberry vein banding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the yellowing along the veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then strawberry model on the top left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then strawberry crinkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those four are all aphid born.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's an example of what we used
to call severe model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Severe strawberry model, it's actually
strawberry model plus paludosis and I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe B.
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudoyellas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually a complex there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these viruses are transmitted
by the aphid ketosiphon fragilefoli which
[SPEAKER_01]: is the common strawberry aphid that we
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll see on the pointer here on
the hairs along the back of this aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: there's little bulbs on the top of each
hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very distinctive feature I've
never seen in any other aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally this is the only aphid you'll see
on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally you'll see the green peach
aphid which doesn't have those bulbous
[SPEAKER_01]: structures at the end of the hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a light green aphid similar in
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the green peach aphid only transmits
one or two of these viruses and is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cause a disease complex in your
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't transmit strawberry
mild yellow edge or strawberry crinkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one we see occasionally is
the cotton aphid or the aphis cassifiae or
[SPEAKER_01]: aphis phabe, the black bean aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, those aphids we don't see very
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only transmit one or two of the
viruses and aren't going to cause a
[SPEAKER_01]: complex if that's the only aphid there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A virus complex because they don't
transmit some of these important aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what the vector is,
just because you see an aphid,
[SPEAKER_01]: check to make sure it's key to siphon
before you get too excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling the aphid to prevent virus
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what really started a lot of this
research was a serious strawberry decline
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that showed up initially in
British Columbia in the cultivar totem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It showed up in the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it their Y2K disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And totem is a cultivar that was released
back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the features it had,
it was virus tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have strawberry mild yellow edge,
mottled and vein banding, and it never
[SPEAKER_01]: showed any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an adjacent field, a hood cultivar,
for example, would be completely decimated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same virus complex and totem
would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2000, we started seeing virus-like
symptoms in totem, which we'll come back
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2002 and 2003, there was a
severe decline in strawberry production
[SPEAKER_01]: areas in California, in the Watsonville
area and now in the Oxnard area,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as well as in northern Washington and
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm located in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really have a big problem in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we didn't have that big
problem in Oregon is we don't have white
[SPEAKER_01]: flies or they're very, very rare to see a
white fly in a strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't get very many aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our summers are so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the two major vectors are
very low populations in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the disease continues to be a problem
in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what the viruses are and we know
how to control that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you an example of that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes a very coordinated effort
because in the Northwest, we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial cropping system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are in the field three to four
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody has to be on the same page as
far as control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to do it for three or four
years to get rid of the inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to get that coordinated
control strategy implemented because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has to buy into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example of strawberries in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in 2003 when I first went down
and looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were on the call last week,
you saw Steve Koike's images of charcoal
[SPEAKER_01]: rot and fusarium rot where they had
complete collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this looks a little bit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look up close, the plants
actually become stunted, discolored,
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventually they might die.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is in a breeder trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see down below here, you see that
you've got stunted plants alongside
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy looking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a complete collapse like we
saw with Steve Koike's talk last week on
[SPEAKER_01]: the charcoal rot and fusarium rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a different beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also you'll see on the lower
right here, the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was walking through those
strawberry fields in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: virtually every leaf had whiteflies on it,
which is a real surprise to me because we
[SPEAKER_01]: had never seen whiteflies on strawberries
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Y2K disease they talk
about up in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are totem plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what they're seeing is a lot of
reddening of the veins, curling of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves, and even the very large lesions
you see on the lower right here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: petioles, highly distorted leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the lower left here, this is a
field about one year after planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first crop is just getting ready to be
picked on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this field has not been harvested yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that area, a number of growers
consider quit growing strawberries because
[SPEAKER_01]: of this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another cultivar impuget
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, one that's very virus tolerant,
had been doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But about 2000, we started seeing a lot of
collapse in these plants prior to the
[SPEAKER_01]: first crop being even picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a virus complex that's showing up
that's present in those fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with these two examples of strawberry
decline, we started looking in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found lots of aphids, the Ketocyphin
Fragifolia, the common strawberry aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, there were many fewer
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the role of each of the viruses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there other viruses involved in
this complex?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set out to first identify which
viruses were present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made a concerted effort to develop
a lab diagnostic assay for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: known viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we did a survey,
which we actually still continue to add
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on the top left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Pallidosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You graft it into Vigaria virginiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants are growing really well,
you can differentiate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants aren't growing that well in
the greenhouse, they sort of look that way
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one to call sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the lower right, we have strawberry
necrotic shock virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see this symptom,
after grafting, it's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get that symptom on one leaflet as
it's emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the leaves subsequent to that look
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you graft and don't look at it for
six weeks, you would never know that
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to watch these on a weekly
basis for every two weeks to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch that symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are some samples we got from the
repository, leafrow virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen this in the field,
the chlorotic fleck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we wanted to make diagnostics,
we went to the repository to look at their
[SPEAKER_01]: collection of infected plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we found initially
was that there were a number of white fly
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted viruses present in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: At relatively high incidence, the
strawberry Pallidosis and Beats of the
[SPEAKER_01]: yellows were very high incidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2003, when they had this serious
collapse, up to 90% of the plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: infected with one or both of these
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strawberry Queenie virus 3 and 4,
those are additional Queenie viruses which
[SPEAKER_01]: should be white fly transmitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't sequenced the entire virus,
but they're present in the field as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a strawberry plant
infected with all four of these viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does not show any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it makes them very susceptible to the
aphid transmitted viruses, very not
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one aphid transmissible virus comes in
there, and then the virus collapses,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant collapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these prime the plant to be extremely
sensitive to the aphid transmitted
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these viruses, white flies,
they're moving all the time in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're strong flyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things can spread very quickly in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the strawberry Pallidosis,
working with Bill Wintermantle,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did some transmission studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, the white flies would have
to be on the field with those plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: about six hours before they could acquire
virus, you know, six to 12 hours before
[SPEAKER_01]: there was any transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not something that they move very
quickly, they feed a little bit and move
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those very short feeds, they're not
transmitting viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to settle down and they have to
actually probe deep enough to feed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: phloem tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: These viruses are associated with the
phloem tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to sit there and feed for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it takes so long for the white
flies to acquire the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is true for transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they acquire the virus and they move
to a new plant, it takes 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, before they were able to
transmit, which means that insecticides
[SPEAKER_01]: may be effective because the white flies
have to be there for a fairly long time
[SPEAKER_01]: before they can transmit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the transmission efficiencies,
this is interesting because in the
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental conditions, beet sooty
yellows was transmitted much more
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively or efficiently than paludosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the field, paludosis was usually
much more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, those greenhouse studies don't
exactly match with what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the interesting ones here are the
melva and the urtica, which are basically
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds in the, can be weeds found in the
perimeters of the field, strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't seem like these are
important sources of inoculum for these
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can be infected and the white
flies will feed on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beet sooty yellows has been known for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very broad host range transmitted
by the same white fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if we look at the aphid
transmitted viruses, the first four
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses on this list are the most common
ones that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the four viruses that really
make up the complex that we see in
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Washington and into British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that's changed in that
complex up there in 2000, prior to that we
[SPEAKER_01]: never saw strawberry crinkle virus in
Northern Washington and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is probably the most common virus
we see up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the big shift?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same aphid species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a new biotype of aphid, a new strain
of the virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this virus is the one that is the new
virus added to that mix when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the decline in totem and other
strawberries growing up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the good news is that strawberry
crinkle virus, once the aphid picks up the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus, it doesn't transmit for about three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of time for intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: To control that virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing strawberries for
fruit, you don't need to control all four
[SPEAKER_01]: of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to control enough of those
so you don't get disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have totem and you can control
crinkle, you control the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the fruit grower, you just want the
plants to do well and look well and not
[SPEAKER_01]: have disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a virus or two that are
symptoms, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a nursery situation, we want the plants
all to be virus-free if possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't know where those plants
are going to go and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce a virus into a new area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry clorotic fleck is aphid
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one we haven't seen in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Latency in strawberry pseudomyled
yellowedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our report in the literature, I've never
seen those in the field, but we do not
[SPEAKER_01]: have isolates of those to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two we do not have lab tests for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing about these viruses,
they have very narrow host ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those first four viruses pretty much only
go to strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're primarily transmitted by the
strawberry aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry aphid is very, very finicky
in that it will feed on strawberry and
[SPEAKER_01]: starve to death almost anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where a coordinated control effort,
if everybody sprays their strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fields for three years, we could get rid
of the inoculum because these viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't hanging out in the native
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the aphids aren't out there in the
native vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going from one field to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time somebody plants a new
field, you've got inoculum moving in from
[SPEAKER_01]: older fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these viruses cause more problems than
any other group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always seem to be an important
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white fly transmitted viruses by
themselves don't seem to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transmitted by ketosyphin, fragile folate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that persistent transmission with
strawberry crinkle is a critical piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: information because it's such a long
latent period, which means we have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of time for intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also the best characterized of
the viruses in strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two viruses that we just don't
have isolates for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We graft index everything in the Clean
Plant Program so these will show up if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematode transmitted viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In North America and strawberry,
we really only see tomato ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see it very, very rarely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is these nematodes don't move
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got good nematocides that people
have been using, either soil fumigation or
[SPEAKER_01]: other nematocides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the incidence of these viruses has
really gone down in North America and
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and other parts of the world as
well because of the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in the annual cropping system,
which is very common in many production
[SPEAKER_01]: areas now, these plants aren't in the
ground long enough for the nematodes to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get there, do the infection,
and cause much disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally not important in these short
life cycle crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in things like raspberry, blackberry,
and blueberry, they can be very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato ringspot and raspberry for us can
be a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Southeast, tomato ringspot and
blackberry is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blueberry is susceptible to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we lose our soil fumigants and
nematocides, these may become a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll solve them in the future,
especially in areas where we've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: matted row perennial cropping system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ILR viruses, there's four of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pollen borne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apple mosaic is very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiloensis, for Gary, Chiloensis virus,
primarily restricted to South America from
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiloensis plants that came from Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a few positive plants in the
northeastern part of the US or
[SPEAKER_01]: southeastern Canada in the Great Lakes
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry necrotic shock and tobacco
streak are often used as synonyms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry necrotic shock is usually the
one that we see in strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a severe reaction in the plants we
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't see them as major
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the nurseries, we want to make
sure that we're not distributing these
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, necrotic shock virus and
tobacco streak are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The antibodies we have will pick up both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have PCR tests that will pick up
both in a single test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people wish to, we can
differentiate by PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, we're interested in
detection and elimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And necrotic shock is the most widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: TSV, tobacco streak, actually is very
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tests will pick up both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our detection for strawberry
viruses as we see it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look down the right-hand
column, you'll see we have ELISA or PCR
[SPEAKER_01]: tests for almost all of these,
with the exception of, let's see,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should have strawberry pseudomyelod
yellow edge in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an ELISA test for pseudomyelod
yellow edge that came out of Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're missing the strawberry latency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strawberry featherleaf, we don't have
an isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the tests now, most of the
viruses, we have good laboratory tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are done in conjunction with
grafting and other tests when we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: our assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a slide of a PCR test for 14
different viruses in strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just to show that we still do,
especially for the clean plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're before cultivars released,
we want to test it to make sure it's free
[SPEAKER_01]: of all known viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do the grafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do ELISA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all the tests we can before we would
suggest that plant be released to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any virus is present, we'll go
through thermal therapy and produce plants
[SPEAKER_01]: free of the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the last, I guess, eight years
now, seven, we've been doing a survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at decline, when we see
symptoms in California, you'll see here we
[SPEAKER_01]: have high incidence of B2D yellows and
paludosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the white fly transmitted
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some aphid transmitted
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grab that arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see some of the aphid transmitted
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have declining plants,
there's always at least one of the aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted viruses there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at symptomless plants in
California, we see a few, but none of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants actually showed symptoms in
this first column.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have one virus or two viruses,
some of these have three or four viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still symptomless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're looking at these declining
plants, we found as many as seven viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: in a single plant on some occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at the Pacific Northwest,
especially Washington and Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have very high levels of the aphid
transmitted viruses strawberry vein
[SPEAKER_01]: manning and the aphid transmitted viruses,
very low levels, if any, of the white fly
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted viruses and a little bit of
strawberry necrotic shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really the aphid transmitted
viruses in the Pacific Northwest that are
[SPEAKER_01]: causing our problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go to the Midwest, you see very few
of the white fly transmitted viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: very few of the aphid transmitted viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of the Midwest,
we have fields that are six years old
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's very little virus present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the disease pressure, because of
vectors, is very, very low in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Minnesota, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you start moving east of there,
you get the air currents coming up from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Gulf Stream and you start seeing,
you'll see more viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the Northeast, we see a lot
more of the white fly transmitted viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see a lot of aphid transmitted
viruses in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit surprising to me,
but that's, you know, we've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: testing out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the white fly transmitted viruses seem
to be much more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking to growers back there and
extension people, they said that they do
[SPEAKER_01]: see white flies, so maybe it shouldn't be
so surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to move along here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are control options?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do biotechnology, try to look at
resistance genes and move those into
[SPEAKER_01]: desired cultivars or engineered resistance
through genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not going to be happening in the
near future, or as it happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to be accepted for
commercial publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really our control options are based on
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vector control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what the vectors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our area in the Northwest,
aphids are the vector of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, it's aphids and white
flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the East Coast, it's more of the white
flies not very many aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You no need to get rid of all of the
vectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get rid of the aphids in California
and you let the white fly transmitted
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses go, you're not going to have
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aphids are much easier to control
because they have such a narrow host
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing vector control,
remember chemical rotation is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to develop resistance to one
or two of the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we limit ourselves to a few chemicals,
pretty soon they become ineffective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And isolation can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found several new viruses,
developed diagnostics, and really in
[SPEAKER_01]: California really worked with the
nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we realized there were white fly
transmitted viruses and they made efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: to control vectors in the nursery,
the problem was pretty much disappeared
[SPEAKER_01]: from the production fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one-year-old planting, has not yet
been harvested, no vector control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is right across the street,
directly across the street, vector
[SPEAKER_01]: control, first-year planting, and the
plants look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning of the third year,
these plants still look beautiful because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing good vector control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is they have to do that
vector control every year unless the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire area gets on board and does it
collectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a good collective effort,
I think they could get rid of the inoculum
[SPEAKER_01]: up there and then need to do very little
vector control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on Rifle Island up in British
Columbia in the Fraser River.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only strawberry field on the
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And west of that island is the Pacific
Ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no inoculum coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a four-year-old field,
no vector control, lots of aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vector management, again, once we knew
whiteflies were an issue and the nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: managers were aggressive about controlling
the whiteflies, it improved aphid control,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also meant the plants coming out of
the nurseries didn't have those whitefly
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, the fruit growers in
California on the annual cropping system
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really have a collapse problem
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by controlling the viruses in the
nurseries, the people and the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: growers didn't have to worry about the
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of looking at nurseries
after the vector control was implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of 400 samples, we tested each
sample for nine viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had two positives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very little disease present in the
nursery, no aphids observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would expect very little disease
the following year in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with Mark Bolda, who's
speaking next.
[SPEAKER_01]: He collected samples for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could see that even in these
production fields, the virus incidence
[SPEAKER_01]: increased over time so that by the end of
the season, there was a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: virus present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the complexes were so minimal,
if at all, there were no symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though there's some virus in these
fruiting fields, there's no disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the fruit growers, that's what
you're worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're worried about disease plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a virus there but not causing a
problem, there's no need to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about prokaryotes,
phytoplasmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, it's really phytoplasmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen them in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're in California, they're very
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're most common in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops, in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can grab that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida, but it's usually less than
about a half a percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably comes in on nursery stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally, they get higher percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, they're a minor problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be detected by PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an example of some symptoms you'll
see with phytoplasmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bacterial disease candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flumabacter, which is common.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find it in France and Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it caused a general collapse of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks a lot like phytoplasmas,
but is caused by a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This you can come back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're running out of time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So virus control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with clean plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most critical thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know the high-risk viruses for your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the vectors?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the vectors that are present?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what the risks are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risks are based on the vectors common
in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, we know it's aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Northeast, it's more likely to be
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the annual cropping systems,
if you start with clean plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses should not be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know the risk associated with planting
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably comes true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also true, like Steve Coyke talked
about, with charcoal rot and fusarium rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we have a really high nematode
population, and there were a crop in there
[SPEAKER_01]: previously that had tomato ring spot,
you might want to not put strawberries
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isolation from other fields, if practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Watsonville area, that is not very
practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many parts of the country, it probably
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no strawberries nearby,
those aphid-transmitted viruses only go to
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vectors only add strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're isolated, you're pretty well
protected from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Implement vector control as needed,
but be sure you know what the problem is
[SPEAKER_01]: before you take control action.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got charcoal rot, spraying for
aphids to control viruses isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do much good, isn't going to do any good,
except maybe make you feel like you did
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as having effect, it's not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of know what the
problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got weak plants in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could easily be similar to what we
looked at in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this field, there's not virus present.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have are areas that are heavily
infested with weevils, and we also have
[SPEAKER_01]: cyclamen mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, spraying this field for aphids
will probably control the cyclamen mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to do much for the weevils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not addressing the real
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a reminder to myself that
not all diseases are called by viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I think I'm going to turn it
over to Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see if there's... OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions for Bob?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to introduce our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have questions for Bob,
be sure you put them into the chat box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go through that at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker is Mr. Mark Bolda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark has been the Caneberry and Strawberry
Farm Advisor in Santa Cruz, Monterey,
[SPEAKER_00]: and San Benito counties since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: He graduated from the University of
Illinois in 1989, after which he served in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States Peace Corps in Paraguay
as an agricultural extensionist from 1989
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: He earned his master's degree in plant
protection and pest management from UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis in 1996, and worked with Plant
Sciences, Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: as a research associate and manager from
1996 to 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark's going to speak to us on spotted
wing dystrophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everybody hear me good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, thank you, Kathy, for the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to spend the next 20 minutes
or so speaking about spotted wing
[SPEAKER_03]: dystrophila, which over the last two years
has become a pest of significant
[SPEAKER_03]: importance in the dairy industries on the
West Coast, and I think will be the same
[SPEAKER_03]: case on the East Coast as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, the work I'm going to present here,
you know, I'm the guy speaking,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there are other people that I did this
work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first couple years, I worked with Ed
Sho from Bristol Research Association,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm also now working with colleague
Elie Hamby from UC Davis in the continuing
[SPEAKER_03]: years as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So spotted wing dystrophila, so you know
what I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a picture of the male fly on
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rather famous photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the flies right on a
raspberry, and you see the two spots on
[SPEAKER_03]: the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get this pointer to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the two spots on the back of
the wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this only in the male spotted wing
dystrophila?
[SPEAKER_03]: The females do not have that spot,
but the spots on the back of the wings of
[SPEAKER_03]: the male are fairly diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we worry about spotted wing
dystrophila?
[SPEAKER_03]: This first, the problem first emerged in
raspberries, and it continues to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: major problem in raspberries in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see this is a piece of raspberry
that looked like the one in the previous
[SPEAKER_03]: picture, opened it up, and you can see
right here, you see there's one larva,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there's another one right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This raspberry looked sound from the
outside, yet when you open it up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a larvae or to the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would be maggots, and that is
unacceptable in the fresh fruit industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been our challenge over the
past two years, and continues to be so for
[SPEAKER_03]: the next coming years as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the history of spotted wing
dystrophila, or SWD, because we have been
[SPEAKER_03]: abbreviating it lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: We first found it in a strawberry field in
August of 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in September, October, November of
the same year, I got many, many calls from
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberry growers complaining of the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always larvae in the fruit, and a lot of
spoiled fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was widely found in strawberry and
raspberry fields in the autumn of 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did submit samples of the California
Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vinegar flies generally are not known to
be
[SPEAKER_03]: known to the United States, but it was
identified as spotted wing dystrophila,
[SPEAKER_03]: an invasive pest to the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was new to the United States,
actually the continental North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we continued to have the infestations
in strawberries and cranberries,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It continued to spread to Oregon,
Washington, British Columbia, Florida,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then this last year, 2010,
up through the eastern seaboard,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I got a phone call there in
November, maybe it was October.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan in blueberries, it showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have it yet, you will very
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to underline this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spreading so quickly as it does,
there is no regulatory action on this
[SPEAKER_03]: pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no quarantines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no restrictions to speak of on
this pest for North American small fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when this pest first emerged in our
area, our approach has to be the right
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just go out and spray whatever
you can and kill as many flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to take a knowledge-based
approach, and of course, that is
[SPEAKER_03]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a three-step process.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're saying now, again, this is a
work in progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is most likely will not be the
final word, but this is what's working for
[SPEAKER_03]: us now.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, you want to monitor and track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kathy Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, we've lost the connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'll hold on, hopefully, Mark will be
able to reconnect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what's happening today there
with the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're waiting for Mark to try to
connect, Bob, are you still here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could answer some of those
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, are the nurseries routinely testing
for viruses?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the nursery level, the certifications
are all run by states, and it's up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual state what type of test they
require.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, they're doing indicator
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing some lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any nurseries in Oregon or
Washington that do strawberries anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not sure what the other states are
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that back east, they're doing lab
tests as well as grafting tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's state by state what the
requirements are.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the National Clean Plant Network,
one of the goals is to harmonize the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements across, you know,
for a given commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're working on blueberry,
but we would like to do the same with
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry, blackberry, and strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on a state-by-state basis what
gets done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some nurseries do more than is required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pam Fischer, what's being used?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know right now, they're using
primarily imidacliprid, various forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not something we do any
control for in Oregon because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: rare, but I think the California nurseries
are doing imidacliprid, either Ed Meyer or
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the names of the actual
products are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they admire that when they're using
imidacliprids, they also are much more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective on aphids than what they had
been using before, so their aphid control
[SPEAKER_01]: actually improved as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, any others?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is there no quarantine?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take a stab at the quarantine one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's because by the time they
realized it was here, it was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: widespread all the way up and down the
West Coast, and I think at that point it
[SPEAKER_01]: was probably in Florida as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who paid for the 3,600 tests we did?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a fair amount of funding from
industry from 2003 through 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had about $200,000 from the strawberry
industries in Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: British Columbia, and California.
[SPEAKER_01]: California put a lot of money into it for
those few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Mark's back online, he's the one that
told me they were probably losing about
[SPEAKER_01]: $25 million worth of crop per year before
they figured out what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I had a phone call from Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to get reconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam has another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it cost per test?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably costs us, bare bones
is about $5 a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing PCR, that first test
costs $5, the second one is probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: like a dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're doing nine, you figure a
minimum of about $14 or $15 per sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing ELISA tests, it's less
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the aphid-borne viruses,
what I recommend, if people are worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about looking at how they're spreading,
is to just follow Strawberry Mild Yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: Edge because we have an ELISA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the most efficiently
transmitted, so it'll be the first one out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, that and Strawberry Model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can pretty much monitor virus
movement by really watching Strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: Mild Yellow Edge in areas where you have a
lot of aphids because that's the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets there as fast as anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, you don't have to test for
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also handle, with ELISA,
you can handle a lot of samples in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry Horntail, Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I know of, but if it was,
I wouldn't be the person they would call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably best to contact the Extension
Office out in Prosser, Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who, Gwen, I can't think of
her name right now, but if you send me an
[SPEAKER_01]: email, I can send you her contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're still waiting to reconnect
with Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, Rufus made a comment about
imidacloprid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I personally don't follow
the, I never make a recommendation for a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide because I don't follow the
what's registered, what's not registered,
[SPEAKER_01]: changes in registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Northwest, the berry industries
combined, all the berries get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And help support somebody at Oregon State
University that really follows everything
[SPEAKER_01]: going into IR4, approved through IR4,
when registrations are stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he updates the industry every year on
what is new coming down the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's been approved, what type of
approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Section 18 or full approval or 24C,
I guess it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also when things are being pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they vary by state,
so I don't make any recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we've still not been able to get to
Mark reconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an internet issue on his end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a change in location when we did
the earlier test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually preparing for an interview
immediately after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope the poor guy's not too stressed
out by the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions for Bob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Second question, are people seeing the
marmorated brown marmorated stink bug in
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the small fruit crops in the
Northeast or the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well we'll give you time to
respond to Bob's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just say thank you for all of
you who have participated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we are finished today,
there will be a link to an exit survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would appreciate your input on the
possibility of another series and the
[SPEAKER_00]: topics you'd like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple five question thing you can
do right online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there's some more people typing,
some more information coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't get Mark back in the next
few minutes, then we'll shift to the exit
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and you'll be able to do that
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate your input on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have Mark's slide show?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you don't see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if Mark doesn't come
back on, if we can at least go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Mark, there you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, are you back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got good people helping me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob answered a bunch of questions,
including some of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't answer any of yours though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just answered the quarantine one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did the quarantine one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right then, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob, I have to say it was somewhat
disconcerting because the entire first
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, I had a blank screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it didn't record like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today must be the day for problems with
webinars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so do I answer the chat questions by
typing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just ... Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom, the question is, I think the lack of
a quarantine was pure politics personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say just because the spread
of the fly was so rapid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when we first had large
infestations in California, some states
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't really interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Oregon was making some noises about
a quarantine, but within days,
[SPEAKER_03]: they also had large infestations of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It spread so quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, not being that close to the regular
suicide, I can't say more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to continue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, to finish the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using enhanced sanitation to reduce
number of supplies remaining in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: That concludes my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go back to slide four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Pam.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you want me to start here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what to do, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to go over the whole talk
again from slide four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, I think on the presentation,
at the end of this slide is where you cut
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of this slide?
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut out right at the end of the
history slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will continue then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, everybody, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, you can hear me, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will do this a little bit briefer
than I did the last time, but the keys so
[SPEAKER_03]: that what we arrived at were keys to
successful management of spotted wing
[SPEAKER_03]: drosophila.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a three-step process of monitoring
and trapping to quickly detect
[SPEAKER_03]: infestations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, use of sprays once those
infestations are discovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then thirdly, the application of a
cultural control, namely enhanced
[SPEAKER_03]: sanitation to reduce numbers of supplies
remaining in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So monitoring and trapping for spotted
wing drosophila.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed and I tested many, many different types
of baits.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tested things, many different parades
of many fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried napa eugenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried commercial field fly baits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, the two baits, and definitely
for us, the yeast sugar water is the one
[SPEAKER_03]: that works the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the recipe right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one package of baker's yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a quarter-ounce baker's yeast
package that you can get at the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twelve ounces of water, four teaspoons of
sugar, and that will be enough to fill
[SPEAKER_03]: four or five traps.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one, and that is apparently
working better for cherry growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: small fruit growers in the Central Valley,
is apple cider vinegar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one sometimes works well for us,
other times it does not.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing with a trap like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at the results of a yeast sugar
water trap right here, looking at the top
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely see the spots on the
backs of the wings of those males.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other flies mixed in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see these two over here to the left,
probably house flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very easy to distinguish in these
traps what you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to search for some thick
goop or do microscopic evaluations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice system for identifying very
quickly what you have in your field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at what the trap looks out in the
field, we've got a glass mason jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes food safety issues come up with
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using it right now for our
population monitoring study.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the lid, there's four holes in the lid
that are an eighth of an inch in diameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The screw-on lid and using a piece of wire
there to hang it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stake and the Tupperware container
over the top of this is to keep out the
[SPEAKER_03]: rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that trap looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's about 100 mils of water in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spraying to control spotted wing
drosophila,
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical sprays for spotted wing
drosophila management.
[SPEAKER_03]: What works well is
[SPEAKER_03]: Malathion, Mustang, and Delegate.
[SPEAKER_03]: These three, again, we screen quite a few
materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malathion is an organophosphate,
Mustang is a pyrethroid, and Delegate is a
[SPEAKER_03]: spinetoram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rotate these materials to preserve their
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Work okay is in truss, iganic,
and azadiracht.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in the organic space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truss is spinosan, iganic is pyrethrin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just ask, who can hear me right
now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, recognize that I have tested a
whole list of chemicals, and that
[SPEAKER_03]: continues to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for writing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's continue on.
[SPEAKER_03]: A note regarding the efficacy of
spinosan's Delegate Radiant Success in the
[SPEAKER_03]: truss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can enhance the efficacy of
these materials by making the fly actually
[SPEAKER_03]: ingest it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't obviously eat that just on
its own, but if you mix it with some kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a bait, such as mulor, or maybe even
acetic acid, it may work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But understand too, that the spinosans
don't last as long when you have them in
[SPEAKER_03]: an acidic medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are putting a bait like mulor or
acetic acid in your tank, you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: buffer that or you need to use lesser
amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not go below pH 6.5 when using these
materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to force down the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic management, again, 20% in the
California caneberry industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The strawberry industry is organic,
and then 5% of the strawberry industry is
[SPEAKER_03]: organic, and that's a lot of acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do need to address the concerns of
the organic industry as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyganic, as a direct and entrust,
they gave us some control, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did last year is use them
repeatedly and try and entrust again,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I had some concerns about the
first time we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did seem that too closely spaced
maximum rate, Pyganic applications,
[SPEAKER_03]: plus or minus as a direct, gave us
significant control of up to one week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may be putting a dent in the
population growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe with three applications we get even
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I would expect so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Single and trust give the same one to
watch, but again, let's watch the
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanitation, this is the third step of the
integrated pest management program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanitation is going to be key.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this slide is double.
[SPEAKER_03]: Implementing sanitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple years ago, this site right here
in California, caneberries, was pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: common, and it wasn't really a worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a leaking pipe there,
lots of water on the ground, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got a lot of old fruit on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the keys for spotted wing
drosophila propagation, moisture,
[SPEAKER_03]: old fruit, that we can no longer have.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're looking for now is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and dry on the top, if it's possible,
and you also notice the total absence of
[SPEAKER_03]: culled fruit laying around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how raspberries, and for that
matter, blackberries, are harvested in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see at the upper part of the slide
the plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gentleman is harvesting fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: In years previous, these coffee cans right
here, each one of them would have a
[SPEAKER_03]: two-quart ice cream container in it,
and every one of those would have
[SPEAKER_03]: marketable fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in these days, the spotted wing
drosophila, what we're doing now is
[SPEAKER_03]: reserving one of those buckets for
collecting culled fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of growers have been implementing
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should caution that we have not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't tested this empirically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to set up a trial to prove it,
but it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: By removing the culled fruit from the
field is we are removing the potential for
[SPEAKER_03]: the fly to complete this life cycle,
but we need to test that out as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what one grower has done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see, again, we've got some
moisture on the top, but again,
[SPEAKER_03]: do notice the absolute absence of old
fruit on the surface of the swim.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the recommendations, again,
to review recommendations, use of an
[SPEAKER_03]: effective bait at regular intervals in the
fruiting field to detect initial entrance
[SPEAKER_03]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: The yeast sugar, the water was good,
and the apple cider vinegar also worked
[SPEAKER_03]: quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two that work good for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, you'll see I mentioned protein
baits.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of off that one now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pesticides, malafina, mustang,
and delegate are very effective in
[SPEAKER_03]: controlling spotted wing drosophila.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, underline, let's rotate those and
also let's apply those.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of bees in cane berries and
strawberries that fly at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to dry and lessen the impact on
bees, because those pyrethroids,
[SPEAKER_03]: thatocannabaphosphate, N and D,
spinendrum, will have an effect on bee
[SPEAKER_03]: populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic growers, high frequent rates of
pyganic or untressed work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same holds true about the beneficial for
bees, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanitation, lastly, removal and
destruction of infested fruit will be
[SPEAKER_03]: essential in keeping down total numbers of
flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the three steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, there's a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have time to answer those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got about ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and Bob, if there are any questions
for Bob, feel free to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Mark, Kevin Schooley would like to
know where the best placement for traps
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, best placement for traps,
we'd like to put about five out per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is good, and I would put them
towards the inside of the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see, I wouldn't put them at
the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spotted wingersophila doesn't like it when
it's so bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it down in the darker part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't put it all the way at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely don't put it on your drip tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe two, three feet off the surface of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for strawberries, you can use
like an old margarine container or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that and do the same and
just stand it in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you really need to be putting it in
where there's shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shade and moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gonna be where most of it lies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other questions for our
speakers today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, both Bob and Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, everyone, for putting up
with our connection issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, Mark, good luck with your interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.
