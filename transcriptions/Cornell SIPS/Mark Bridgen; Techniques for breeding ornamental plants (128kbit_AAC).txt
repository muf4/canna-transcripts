[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a pleasure to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the grad students for the
wonderful lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some pizza and some nice
conversation and, I think, tentative plans
[SPEAKER_00]: for coming down to Long Island to visit us
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for those of you who don't know
where Long Island is, it is down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large, actually it's the
largest island in continental United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about 118 miles long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's longer than Connecticut, than the
state of Connecticut, in case you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only about 23 miles wide,
so it's very narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, I've been down there now for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very strong agricultural location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of New Yorkers don't realize
that, but Suffolk County out here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eastern part of Long Island used to be the
number one agricultural county in the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire state until about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's number two for total agriculture,
but it's still number one for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're zone seven, so we have a
different climate than you have up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned now, we're number two for
total value of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all ag products, excuse me,
but we're number one for crop agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're number one for greenhouse production
in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're number one for nursery production in
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number five for vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you like ducks and chickens,
we're also number one for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a lot of agriculture down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's surprising, very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our research center, this is a photo
of our research center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 68 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come down, in the wintertime,
when there's no crops in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stand in one location and pretty
much see the entire 68 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have specialists in ornamental plants,
trees and shrubs, also the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, vegetables and fruits, specifically
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two plant pathologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two entomologists, a wheat
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I handle the plant tissue culture
requirements, which frankly, there aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole lot on Long Island, but a little
bit in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point I bring this, I show you
this slide is because we're the only
[SPEAKER_00]: research station in the United States that
actually is a one stop shop for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers come in, we're kind of a true
example of extension in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of our stakeholders are
within a 50 mile radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not uncommon for them to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bring their diseased plants,
their insects, or they'll ask us to go
[SPEAKER_00]: visit them and try to help solve a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do interact with them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of applied research on their
behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was telling some of the grad
students, if you're interested in doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your research down here,
we're part of CALS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk to you about
today or at least start off with is talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about our alstroemeria project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an alstroemeria we introduced when
I was back at Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Sweet Lar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only fragrant alstroemeria in the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to tell you a little bit
about plant collection, how we started
[SPEAKER_00]: there, some of our hybridization,
how we had to incorporate in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques to accomplish our breeding
objectives, and then some plant
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started at the University of
Connecticut back in 1984.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students were asking me at lunch
today how I chose alstroemeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained that when you start
working at a university, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for a new faculty member is
to develop an independent research
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an agency called the
American Floral Endowment at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: that had a list of priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of them was breeding
alstroemeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two countries that have
alstroemeria species are Chile and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the old traditional
breeding procedures, I decided to go
[SPEAKER_00]: collect some plants because species were
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made only two collecting trips to
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been to Chile now 21 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great country for the
alstroemeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 60 species of alstroemeria
in Chile, about 10 in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we go to Chile a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My students gave a seminar yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a class on plant biodiversity that
went to Chile in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think international travel is a
great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several of these students are breeding
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we emphasized during the trip,
although it was a plant biodiversity trip,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did talk a lot about plant collecting,
the ethics of plant collecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the procedures of plant collecting,
and plant exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a good opportunity for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that Chile has evolved so
many unique species of alstroemeria is
[SPEAKER_00]: because we called it an ecological island,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andes Mountains on its eastern border,
the Pacific Ocean on the western border
[SPEAKER_00]: and the southern border, and the Atacama
Desert, which is actually the driest
[SPEAKER_00]: desert in the world, to the north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this country, as it evolved,
plants evolved, as birds and animals and
[SPEAKER_00]: insects evolved, they're totally different
from what we have here in the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are many species that exist
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the students were asking at lunch
about what are some new things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of crops in Chile that
have potential to be doing some work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although we collected many
alstroemeria over the years, this one
[SPEAKER_00]: here, this species from southern Chile,
alstroemeria aria, is our primary species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of choice for our breeding program,
because our main goal is to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: alstroemeria that are winter hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that this one species allows
us to integrate that trait into our
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this now for every, almost,
well, it is almost everything we've
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced now, is alstroemeria aria,
pelican species from along the coast
[SPEAKER_00]: northwest of Santiago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great seed setter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've used many species in our
breeding program over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are quite beautiful, large flowers
that we've just used to incorporate flower
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did bring some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year, we don't usually have
flowers in the greenhouse, but we happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to have some plants that were in flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of the color
variation, we have almost every color
[SPEAKER_00]: except green and a true blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because we've integrated all
these different species into the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil, as I mentioned, didn't have a lot
of species to work with, but they did
[SPEAKER_00]: offer these two species that we were
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out that the Chilean species are
winter dormant, and the Brazilian species
[SPEAKER_00]: are summer dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, when you cross these
two species, you get an ever blooming
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, if you had a good environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's not going to be ever
blooming here in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had it in the greenhouse,
it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice that the Chilean Ostromeri,
they have these worlds of leaves quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the Chilean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, this Brazilian Ostromeri have
the worlds of leaves, whereas the Chilean
[SPEAKER_00]: ones have different kinds of linear
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants gave us a little bit of
height reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one in particular gave us
fragrance, which was one of our original
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding goals, is to get fragrant
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these species originated in
the Brasilia area, Sao Paulo area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, using old fashioned breeding
techniques back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have the internet like we have
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the process was to go to the New
York Botanical Garden, look at their
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium specimens, and just look at
where they had been found by previous
[SPEAKER_00]: plant explorers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ostromeri are a very nice plant to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're protandrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the male anthers will
produce their pollen before the female
[SPEAKER_00]: emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the pollen is formed on
the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time the female,
it has a tripartite stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the female is ready to be
fertilized, the male pollen is already
[SPEAKER_00]: dead and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about
emasculation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very nice plant to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we started doing the breeding,
we found out very quickly that we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: move into an in vitro technique to help
our hybrids survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we found out that when you do
interspecific hybridization with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ostromeria, you will produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, though, the seeds will
spontaneously abort on the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're miscarried because if you want to
talk in a different fashion, we could say
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could recognize the lethal gene
of the father, and they will spontaneously
[SPEAKER_00]: abort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is we found out that we
can actually go in and remove the embryos
[SPEAKER_00]: after we fertilize the plants about six to
10 days after fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get them to survive if we put
them in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do use some tissue culture
techniques, which I'm going to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, when I talk about
introduction to the plants, I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about micropropagation, which is a
subcategory of plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micropropagation is just the clonal
multiplication of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to put a plug in for my class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach propagation here in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be offered this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after this fall, it's changing to
every other year, because traveling up
[SPEAKER_00]: here every week in the fall is kind of
tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be offered every other
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're interested, it'll be offered
this fall, Friday mornings from 9 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use that brand new teaching lab in
plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lots of flow hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want some experience with tissue
culture, think about taking that or an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent study kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an Ostromeria seed pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ovary cracked open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the ovules, the few seeds
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're doing ovary
culture, if you've done ovary culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that this is way too late to
sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside of an ovary is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no pathogens, no fungi,
no bacteria, as long as it's not cracked
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can sterilize it 100% bleach,
100% ethanol, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really do whatever you want to to
sterilize the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you aseptically cut it open and
remove these ovules and put them in tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get about a 60% to 65% success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put it in tissue culture,
they will germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, we end up with,
hopefully, some nice new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one we introduced back in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's not in Winterharty,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I talked about Sweet Laura earlier,
the fragrant Ostromeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of Vembro culture,
a successful emerald culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the Aria species from Southern
Chile and the Cariafla species from
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, of course, offered the
fragrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Aria offered us Winterhartiness as
well as some flower stem length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up with this really beautiful
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the emerald culture,
we've used other in vitro techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is just mutation procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cells in vitro will mutate
spontaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, as breeders, use the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually do that by using
something as simple as Surflam,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like 0.1% usually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do some trials and experiments
looking at what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are different ways you can
induce mutations in tissue cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are somatic embryos from Ostromeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: A somatic embryo is just an embryo that
will produce off of a part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these embryos emerge from an
ovule germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other plants, you can get somatic
embryos from leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them from roots, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subject them to the mutagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then wait and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually direct mutations if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some work back, again, in
Connecticut in the years in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some work looking at developing
insect resistance by soma clona variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were the first lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my grad students did all the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the grad students who do the
work, so I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that first, even though I'm
taking responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my grad students do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grad student actually worked with a
plant called Terenia, which is a wishbone
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed greenhouse white fly
resistance and spider mite resistance by
[SPEAKER_00]: soma clona variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can do a lot of things
directing the kind of mutation you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we were just looking for
flower differences and growth differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Ostromeria that produced callus
and regenerate shoots from the mutated
[SPEAKER_00]: callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an Ostromeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brassica that shows you that you
can get callus from many parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and direct the mutation that you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And micropropagation, I mentioned,
is a very important part of our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are no longer breeding Ostromeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at that stage of my career that
we're focusing on trying to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: released to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ostromeria, very slow to propagate
traditionally by division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we're going to succeed by
getting this plant propagated is by
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in tissue culture and
micropropagating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult with this plant
because it's a rhizome underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizome is covered with all kinds of
fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult to get clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With hard work, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, once you get it cleaned
off, you can start to micropropagate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: divide it up, and increase your numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a very slow plant to propagate
in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a micropropagation rate
of only two and a half to three every four
[SPEAKER_00]: to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare this to rhododendrons or mountain
laurels or lilacs where you're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication rate of 15 to 18 or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make enough money from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the only way we're going to get
this into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the two that we introduced at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, as I mentioned, the first
ornamental plant that Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Maw of Majesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the second one in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Tangerine Tango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a bunch more that are waiting
to be introduced as soon as we get them
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely winter hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trialed them not only in London,
Long Island, where we're zone seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we trialed them up here in Ithaca at
Bluegrass Lane, which is your zone five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some out in Chicago right now
because Ball Horticulture is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our varieties to introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also trialed some in Georgia
because heat tolerance is another
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just shows you the variety of
colors that we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a photo I took last fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went out to the field and cut a
whole bunch of flowers and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a nice variety of flower
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bloom all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Long Island, we get hot summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still flower all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably helps them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But great for a cut flower, great for a
garden flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stop here just for a minute if
there's any specific questions on
[SPEAKER_00]: Alstroemeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll move into some of the other
things that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are your somoclonal variants stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are the somoclonal
variants stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we'll get a leaf variegation,
but that has not proven to be stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Alstroemeria are kind of like
chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will mutate quite readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do remain pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem that we have with some of
them is that in some cases, we get flower
[SPEAKER_00]: fasciation as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll fuse together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three flowers will fasciate as it
emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem we can live with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of our mutations are stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I want to talk about two other
crops that we're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know James.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Singapore now breeding orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did the initial work with the
impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at resistance to a very
devastating disease called Downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason he was doing this is that
it's a very valuable crop in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 2010, before the whole industry
was obliterated, it was $151 million
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York alone, it was worth $10.4
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants are very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you all know this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, like the ulstroemeria,
comes in almost every color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a true yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a true blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it grows in sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows in shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people love this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, it's off the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might know the reason for this is
this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know how this disease
was introduced to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it came over from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came over in a hurricane that
traveled from Africa and inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the prevailing winds in the
United States go northwards in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the winds inoculated then the entire
eastern coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it spread to the rest of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within three years, this disease had
ruined the impatiens market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens after it gets hit
with the downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say, well, why don't you
just spray it with fungicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fungicides will control the downy
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they only last for about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grower can spray his crop of
impatiens in the greenhouse right before
[SPEAKER_00]: sale with the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for six weeks, they'll be looking
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week number seven or eight, if the
pathogen is around, the plants will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think ethically, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you introduce a plant that's going
to really end up dying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we had a very dry summer in
Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the last two summers,
we didn't see a lot of downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the disease first hit Cornell,
we made a recommendation to the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York not to sell impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot stopped selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the big chain stores stopped selling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did have a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a summer like last year and
a summer like the year before with being
[SPEAKER_00]: so dry, people wanted them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to remember that if the
inoculum is not there, the disease is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once the disease hits and then it's a
fungal spore that blows in the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: it spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's certainly a project still worth
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pan-American seed has new hybrids out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impatiens hawkeri is a different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's resistant to downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made some hybrids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't look like what we think of
as a traditional impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But James started his project,
again, kind of the old-fashioned way,
[SPEAKER_00]: with plant breeding and looking at
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at several different species of
impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had quite the collection here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he propagated them, brought them down
to Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the disease on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually encourage the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our center has all kinds of diseases and
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not a place you want to
bring a plant you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we put these under a shade house with
mist in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice and wet and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we encouraged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he selected the species that were most
resistant to the downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from his research,
looking at our control plant, which we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew was very susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a lot of downy mildew to this
bounce, which was the introduction from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pan-American seed, which was shown to be
very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's just genetic
diversity in the amount of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the plants that James focused
on when he was making his initial hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows you this is the
susceptible walleriana, the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of his resistant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: His main goal, of course, was to find
hybrids that were resistant to the downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you need to have a plant that is
good looking, grows well, and propagates
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came up with these two main hybrids
that were extremely resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, he did this very tedious testing
counting leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd come down in the summertime and his
different replications.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd remove every leaf of the plants and
count them, inspect them for if they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are his two plants that I just
showed previously on the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they're fairly resistant,
again, comparing to our controls that are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost totally resistant and the one
that's very susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, oops, sorry, I went too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we are with these two
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants currently need to be
propagated asexually by cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a propagator or a grower of
impatiens, you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's going to add money,
expense, to your plant because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: slow to propagate asexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did some old-fashioned extension
work and visited several growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly in Long Island but throughout New
York, big growers, and asked them about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a vegetatively propagated impatiens
something that you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a plant I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a seed-propagated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed-propagated is much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much less expensive for their end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're currently at that point now
that we're trying to inbreed these and
[SPEAKER_00]: then eventually produce a seed-propagated
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we'll have some nice
seed-propagated disease-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out very interestingly when we
started doing this self-pollinations that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a very wide variety of flower
colors now, which we really didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from white to orange to,
you know, so we have some nice color
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't tested those yet for their
resistance, but we will this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the last project,
you know, many of you know Noor,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's working on his master's with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's currently now in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing an internship at Pride's Corner
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very large tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going over tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving over tomorrow to go visit him
and see how he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's working on this chase tree,
which is a beautiful shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be hardy here in
Ithaca, but I've noticed two years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were two plants planted at
Cornell Botanical Garden, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: still doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe climate change is a good thing
for us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's working with this plant primarily
because it's a plant that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: much variety in flower color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This purple color is about the only thing
that comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's slightly pink,
doesn't grow really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to develop some plants with
some new flower colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a plant that can get quite tall,
15 to 20 feet tall in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice thing about this is a plant that the
deer will not eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely deer resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also good for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attracts many kinds of butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a good substitute for this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know Budlia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budlia is not on the state's invasive list
yet, but it may very well be soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Vitex is a good plant that can
substitute for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're working on Vitex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noor is the beginning of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has two primary research objectives to
his project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is looking at developing a
technique to get some more clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is to develop a
micropropagation protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is once we have
the protocol for mutations, we'll mutate a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants, which we're already in
the process of doing, and then hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be able to introduce it by knowing
this micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's succeeded with both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a motto in my lab over the door
that says, ain't nothing easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our motto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes you think, oh,
this would be an easy project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this would be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the soma clona variation,
we thought that would be easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of publications out
using surf land and doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that these plants really
are somewhat recalcitrant to this
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did come up with a protocol that
we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also came up with a protocol for
micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step with this plant is to
start evaluating these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: start mutating a bunch more, and then
seeing what we come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, we had one last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a very small group of plants
from initial experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now a plant that's fastidious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grows straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see if that's kind of consistent
and if we can propagate that and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the plants that we've
bred over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk about them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are plants that we've worked on
for the last 29 years, different graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an inflectibility of people's
diets to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for flowers, the leaders in the
gardeners would rather we accept a
[SPEAKER_01]: different sort of a patient if it weren't
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then why would we need to create a
hybrid of patients instead of just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to introduce a new species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the question is how flexible are
gardeners to grow new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think impatience is probably a
good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love impatience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this bounce, for example, that I was
shown is one of our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown it, well, pretty much just
for the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a nice looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people like the variety of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gardeners are really part of the
reason for this problem with the downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the United States, people have
planted impatience in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that grows best in shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will grow in sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to make sure it's irrigated
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've planted beds and beds of
impatience in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the irrigation come on at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, of course, they want to save
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want people seeing it being
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they irrigate at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at night, it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogens are happy with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the disease spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're part of the original
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get back to your question,
I think they're just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not real flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have something that they really
like, they want to stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a scale from Daffodil to tulips,
where does Vitex fit in your resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tulips are extremely, dear love to
eat tulips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And daffodils, they won't touch usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might nibble a bud, but not usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're with daffodils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're daffodils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I didn't talk about this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had this project going on for
about 25 years, kind of a personal hobby,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at deer resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every place I've lived in
Connecticut and New York has had deer
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is an avid gardener, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both like gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we finally gave up and figured,
OK, we're going to find these plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are truly resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our gardens have been the trial site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we have deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have dozens of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've planted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plants that are definitely
resistant, boxwoods, piers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list online, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bleeding hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dicentra eximia, the small one,
is more resistant than the large Dicentra
spectabilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, with the large bleeding
heart, if you have a white flared plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to be more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, we're not sure why,
but it seems like a lot of white plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: white leafed plants are more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe the deer don't see that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not as resistant as daffodils
and vitex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not as susceptible to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the eximia is pretty resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller one, which is a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flies all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
