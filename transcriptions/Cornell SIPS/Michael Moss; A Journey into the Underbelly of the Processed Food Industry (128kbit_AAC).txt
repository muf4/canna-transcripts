[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've brought my little friend Prezi
with me, which I hope all you teachers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room are using other than PowerPoint
these days because it doesn't have words.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has cool little pictures,
which maybe will still put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really lucky to talk to students
in a bunch of places like Yale and
[SPEAKER_01]: Princeton and Harvard and MIT and Santa
Barbara and Berkeley and UCLA and two
[SPEAKER_01]: public health groups in wonderful
conference places like Disneyland or
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians dealing with obesity and
diabetes in places like Saudi Arabia here
[SPEAKER_01]: for this recent talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never been able or allowed to
actually read from my book, Salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar, Fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do that here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I laugh every time I see
the cover because it was designed by this
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy Russian emigre who lives upstate in
New York who, to do it, went into his
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store and pulled out his favorite
products off the shelf and brought it back
[SPEAKER_01]: to his studio and hand-ripped the
lettering out of them and rearranged the
[SPEAKER_01]: letters to reflect what is really going on
about the products that he and I and you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, to some extent, love so deeply,
which, of course, is what the book is all
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually not going to read from
the book, but I'm going to cite a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of facts from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2002, the largest food company of all,
Nestle, paid $2.6 billion for the Hot
[SPEAKER_01]: Pocket brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That frozen, microwavable delicacy that
became a poster child for, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: exuberant snacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And five years later, Nestle acquired the
rights to this drink, which helped it
[SPEAKER_01]: corner the market on one of the grimmest
results of overeating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year in this country, some 200,000
people undergo bariatric surgery to
[SPEAKER_01]: physically shrink their stomach as a way
of helping them to actually eat less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, gorge on the Hot Pocket, get fat on
the Hot Pocket, and then eat through a
[SPEAKER_01]: tube was Nestle's marketing strategy,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them fat, get them thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on page 337 of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, imagine my surprise, now summer before
last, when I got a call from none other
[SPEAKER_01]: than Nestle's research and development
organization on the lovely shores of Lake
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva, asking me to come give my book
talk to their secret gathering,
[SPEAKER_01]: not secret, private gathering,
of 60 R&D people, maybe 70 or 80,
[SPEAKER_01]: from all over the world that they had
gathered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first reaction was, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I told my son Aaron, who is with
us in the audience today, about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: his reaction was, I hope you're not
spending my future tuition money on a
[SPEAKER_01]: round-trip ticket to Geneva, because
there's no way they're gonna let you come
[SPEAKER_01]: back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna shove you off the
Matterhorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But know that the R&D team had a new head
who convinced me that he was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn a corner at Nestle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had read the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were responding to changing consumer
demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order for them to do good,
they needed to hear more from people like
[SPEAKER_01]: me about all the bad things that they had
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, though, this is the richest
company in the food business, or certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: is from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nestle is the owner of 29 of what it calls
the billionaire brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: As one of its research scientists put it
to me, Nestle is the Swiss bank that
[SPEAKER_01]: prints food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I decided to go, in part because I
wanted to know what their 350 PhDs were up
[SPEAKER_01]: to these days, who work exclusively on
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went, I actually took Aaron with me
as a bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the group right before I got up to
give my little spiel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm giving you a little bit of the
shortened version of what I said to
[SPEAKER_01]: Nestle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started out with the fact that in
2008, I was actually in Algeria writing
[SPEAKER_01]: about jihadi militants when a couple of
FBI agents showed up at the New York Times
[SPEAKER_01]: headquarters looking for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been traveling to Iraq and to the
Middle East, first tormenting the Pentagon
[SPEAKER_01]: for failing to equip American and then
Iraqi soldiers with armor, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how the war in Iraq was fueling
the ability of recruiters in other parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world to recruit new jihadis,
like Abu Omar here, whose job,
[SPEAKER_01]: as he showed me, was building better and
more deadly IEDs to kill more Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up in Algeria writing about
insurgence there when the newspaper
[SPEAKER_01]: decided it was probably time for me to
come home and find something safer to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mention this really only because I
went from one war to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having coffee with my editor at the
New York Times on the 14th floor
[SPEAKER_01]: cafeteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I was still pitching her a
story about US arms sales overseas,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, when she said to me,
you know, Michael, what do you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: peanuts?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, come on, Christy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let me tell you about these
missiles and this tear gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, no, no, listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been an outbreak of salmonella in
peanuts being manufactured by a factory in
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgia on the Alabama border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are getting sick all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still kind of demurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's going, look, Michael,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And investigative editors like to think of
base notes for being potentially big
[SPEAKER_01]: stories to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she says, look, these peanuts aren't
being manufactured by China or some other
[SPEAKER_01]: far off place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't blame them for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is of our own making.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands of people are being sickened.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are even people starting to die in
most states across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these peanuts are being used as
ingredients by this $1 trillion process
[SPEAKER_01]: food industry about which we really know
very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, when I went down to
Georgia, and spent some time reporting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground, that outbreak became the story
about how that industry had lost control
[SPEAKER_01]: over its food chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weeks and weeks were going by,
and the largest companies were still
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out if they were using
those peanuts in their products,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eventually recalling those
products to ensure safety of consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my reporting on food safety next took
me to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where I was
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly lucky to come across a trove of
documents that allowed me for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time to tell the story of the making of a
hamburger that sickened many people
[SPEAKER_01]: because of an E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli contamination, including Stephanie
Smith here.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a 22-year-old dance instructor who
had a burger at her mom's house for Sunday
[SPEAKER_01]: supper.
[SPEAKER_01]: One week and a week later, coming out of a
forced coma, she was paralyzed from the
[SPEAKER_01]: waist down because of the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli in the hamburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Stephanie allowed me to sort of put a
human face on this trove of documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story of that contamination was an
industry that intentionally avoided
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing about its food chain in order to
avoid costly recalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not want to trace back the
hamburger sources to these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to slaughter houses because
that would then be traced forward to other
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was Cargill creating the
hamburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was having dinner with one of my
best sources, Mansour here, who tests
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens for the meat industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, it was Mansour who
Chipotle hired recently to turn its
[SPEAKER_01]: company around from a food safety
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said to me, you know, Michael,
because as tragic as these episodes of
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination are, you really should look
at what my industry, he was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the meat industry, is intentionally adding
to its products over which it has absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was talking about none other than
salt, especially huge in processed meats,
[SPEAKER_01]: which got me thinking about sugar and got
me thinking about fat as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that became the impetus to the
research and the reporting that took me
[SPEAKER_01]: through for the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things I had to
grapple with was, well, of course we
[SPEAKER_01]: already know that eating too much of food,
I like to call the stuff we hate to love,
[SPEAKER_01]: can make us, you know, unhealthily
overweight and otherwise ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, I was amazingly lucky to
come across a mountain of documents,
[SPEAKER_01]: emails and white papers and memos and
strategy papers that put me at the table
[SPEAKER_01]: of the largest food companies in the world
as they were formulating and strategizing
[SPEAKER_01]: and marketing their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was those documents that enabled me
to identify key players in those companies
[SPEAKER_01]: and then convince them to talk to me and
open up and tell me even more secrets
[SPEAKER_01]: about their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the overwhelming sense of that
material in those interviews, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: what the book is about, is a sense that
this is an industry that's driving 24-7
[SPEAKER_01]: not just to get us to not just like their
products, but to want more and more of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no word that they hate more than
the A word, addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will justifiably argue that,
look, you really can't compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Oreos with drugs or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's some validity to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't even need to use the A word
in describing their efforts to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: the allure of their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about maximizing snackability
and craveability.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite terms is more-ishness.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't English majors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are bench chemists, marketing people
describing their efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, it's also not like this is,
I view this as this evil empire that
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally set out to make us
overweight or otherwise ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are companies doing what all
companies want to do, which is to make as
[SPEAKER_01]: much money as possible by selling as much
product as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem lies in their own sort of deep
dependence on using gobs of salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar, and fat to sort of get to that,
get to that sort of ideal product in their
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes, which is low-cost, convenient,
and utterly irresistible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was incredibly lucky to spend time with
a legend in the industry named Howard
[SPEAKER_01]: Moskowitz, who's responsible for many of
the icons in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trained in high math at Queens
College and then experimental psychology
[SPEAKER_01]: at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Howard walked me through one of his
recent creations, which was a new soda
[SPEAKER_01]: flake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a flavor for Dr. Pepper,
in which he started with no less than 60
[SPEAKER_01]: versions of sweetness, each one just
slightly different than the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: and subjected those to his 3,000-plus
consumer taste tests around the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then took the data, threw it in his
computer, did his high math regression
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out came typically charts like this,
a bell-shaped curve where at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the curve is not the dreaded middle C you
get in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rather the perfect amount of
sweetness, not too little, not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Howard Moskowitz who coined the
term the bliss point to describe that
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect amount of sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk to nutritionists,
you realize that the problem is not that
[SPEAKER_01]: the food industry has created,
or in Howard's word, engineered bliss
[SPEAKER_01]: points for things like ice cream and
cookies and soda, things we know and
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to be sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that they've marched around the
grocery store adding sugar to products
[SPEAKER_01]: that didn't used to be sweet before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now breads have added sugar and an
engineered bliss point for sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some yogurts can still have as much sugar
per serving as ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite spots in the grocery
store is the pasta sauce aisle,
[SPEAKER_01]: where some brands can have the equivalent
of a couple of Oreo cookies with a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness and a tiny half cup serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this does is teach us to expect
sweetness in everything we eat,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a real problem for kids,
especially because they are born hardwired
[SPEAKER_01]: for sweet taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you drag them over to the produce
aisle and try to get them interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: things like Brussels sprouts and celery
and broccoli, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: rebellion on your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just sugar, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to draw a drug analogy,
which I hesitate to do, but if you were to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare sugar to amphetamine, fat to the
food industry is the opiate for its also
[SPEAKER_01]: very powerful, very subtle way of sneaking
up on you, not with a bliss point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with what the industry calls the mouth
feel, because as you all know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fats are still not quite accepted as an
official taste, but rather that sensation,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks to the trigeminal nerve of biting
into a warm toasted cheese sandwich,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can tell I'm a bit of a salt and fat
guy, because the reward center of my brain
[SPEAKER_01]: is going off, because that's connected to
the pleasure centers of your brain just as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as sugar is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things the industry learned
with that is I write in the book that they
[SPEAKER_01]: could use the excess processed cheese that
they were generating as an ingredient in
[SPEAKER_01]: processed foods to increase the allure of
those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why sandwich shops,
through a very strategic joint venture
[SPEAKER_01]: between industry and the government,
began offering and promoting and marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese on every sandwich you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could walk through the grocery
store and so many products now have added
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese in it, not cheese for its own
lovely sense of eating, but cheese as an
[SPEAKER_01]: added ingredient with those extra
calories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's salt, of course,
which is a strange creature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the drug analogy to
salt is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these days it's methadone,
because they're trying to come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: salt substitutes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our salt consumption typically is
like so much higher than certainly some
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists think we should be eating
because of the links to high blood
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and heart disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real eye-opener for me was the
moment when I asked some of the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: food companies, why are you using so much
salt, not in things I expect to be salty,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just in your across-the-board
processed foods?
[SPEAKER_01]: And none other than Kellogg's invited me
in to show me what salt meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only did I get to tour their R&D
factory, but they sat me down and prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: for me special versions of some of the
biggest icons in the grocery store without
[SPEAKER_01]: using any salt in them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started with the Cheez-Its,
which I managed to take a little snapshot
[SPEAKER_01]: of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally I could eat those day in,
day out, but without salt, we couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even swallow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stuck rather to the roof of our mouth
because salt adds texture and solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved on to the frozen waffles,
put them in the toaster, and they came out
[SPEAKER_01]: looking and tasting like straw because
salt adds color and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we moved on to the corn flakes,
put them in the bowl, added some water,
[SPEAKER_01]: took a bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I could say anything,
the chief spokeswoman for the company was
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gets this look of horror on her face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she swallows and blurts out the word
metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste metal, M-E-T-A-L.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chief technical officer is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he starts chuckling and goes,
yeah, not everybody will get this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the beautiful things that makes
salt such a miracle ingredient to us is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it will mask some of the off-notes,
bad taste, that are inherent to some
[SPEAKER_01]: processed foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, some of the added minerals
to the corn flakes would give you what I
[SPEAKER_01]: had, a sensation of one of my fillings
coming loose and sloshing around in my
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I really got it,
which is as dependent as we've become on
[SPEAKER_01]: large amounts of salt, sugar, fat,
the industry itself is even more dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: on them, which is a real problem for it
now because those same companies like
[SPEAKER_01]: Nestle are now trying to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went on with Nestle and I said,
look, as you guys know, it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: salt, sugar, fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the marketing, of course,
that goes into the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And increasingly, marketing people began
to run the largest food companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a wonderful time with Ed Martin,
who was part of a SWAT team at Kellogg's
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were losing market share to
General Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me how they sat around one day
and they steamed up this thing called Rice
[SPEAKER_01]: Krispies Treat Cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they thought, well, that's a great
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it to the technicians and let
them work it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the poor technicians came back and
pulling their hair out and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every time we tried to add
marshmallow to the cereal, it turns to
[SPEAKER_01]: mush and mush is the death of cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the marketing people went back to their
consumer panel and said, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't quite do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, help us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, look, you don't
really have to give us marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably just give us the
sensation of marshmallow, the taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor or the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be powerful enough for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the industry coined the term
permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will give you permission to fool us if
you just get close enough to the real
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice Krispies Treat Cereal without the
real marshmallows became a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Kellogg's, I spent a whole chapter on
the Lunchables because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet and spend lots of time with
the inventor of the Lunchables,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Drain, who was still amazed to this
day that they managed to turn little
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of processed cheese and processed
meat and crackers, something nobody would
[SPEAKER_01]: be even interested in eating necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into a billion dollar a year brand that
kids would get excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at one point in the process,
they learned and decided and were sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: known for saying among themselves that
they realized that Lunchables wasn't about
[SPEAKER_01]: the food as much as it was the badge
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great buzz that gave to the kid who
pulled one of these Lunchables out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: lunchroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: He or she became the cat's meow of the
lunchroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they came up with that slogan for
the kids, all day you got to do what they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, but lunchtime is all yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food industry is incredibly smart
about hitting, finding and hitting those
[SPEAKER_01]: emotional buttons, which really for much
of the time is what drives us to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, there was Jeffrey Dunn
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the fiercest warrior at this
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He rose to become president of Coca-Cola
for North America, South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey Dunn walked me through Coke's
pioneering of the Super Size Me phenomena
[SPEAKER_01]: where they decided they could make more
money by offering unlimited amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: drink, soda, Coca-Cola to people in
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really the ingredients didn't cost
that more even for the mega sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The warlike language they used in their
competition with Pepsi, where they would
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to their best customers,
people who would drink two or three Cokes
[SPEAKER_01]: a day or more, not as their best
customers, but as heavy users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're targeting of people like
Tatiana here, who I caught up with in a
[SPEAKER_01]: corner store in Philadelphia, knowing that
when kids walk into a store with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of their own spending money and make
those first decisions about what to buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will become imprinted on that
product, on that brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why Coke, the envy of solid
food manufacturers around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: focused so hard on putting Cokes in the
hands of kids at ballparks, knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of that joyous moment of a kid being
with their parent and getting that product
[SPEAKER_01]: in their hand was worth gazillions in
advertising, in implanting that wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: memory in the kid's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's the analogy to
tobacco, which isn't just an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of us have forgotten that back in the
1980s, the largest tobacco company in
[SPEAKER_01]: North America, eventually the world,
became the largest food manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: Philip Morris, through its acquisition of
General Foods, the old food conglomerate
[SPEAKER_01]: out of New York, and Kraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was lucky to spend time with some of
the former CEOs of Philip Morris,
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining to me how they lent some of
their marketing practices for cigarettes
[SPEAKER_01]: to their food managers at Kraft and
General Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which also led me to write about in the
beginning of the book, sort of this
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderfully powerful moment back in 1999,
when the heads of the largest food
[SPEAKER_01]: companies got together privately,
brought together by cabals of insiders
[SPEAKER_01]: within their own companies who were
becoming increasingly concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: their culpability in the growing obesity,
not just obesity, but other health crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up before them stands a scene where a
senior official at the biggest company of
[SPEAKER_01]: all, Kraft, he's armed with 72 slides,
including this one here that he's showing
[SPEAKER_01]: to the CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he lays at their feet responsibility,
not just for the growing obesity
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, but diabetes, gout,
several types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pleads with the executives to start
doing something meaningful to turn a
[SPEAKER_01]: corner and in part, reformulate their
products to be truly healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sits down, and as I write in the book,
one of the biggest, most powerful CEOs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room stands up and is visibly angry
and says, look, we are already sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: to what consumers want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want a low fat this or a low sugar
this, we make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the shelf there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to remember that we are
also beholden to shareholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is no way we're going to mess
around with the company jewels,
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to salt, sugar, fat,
if that's going to lead to lower sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we would not be responsible then
to those shareholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by and large, that's still the basic
story of the food industry today,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and because it was Nestle,
I reminded them that they were sending
[SPEAKER_01]: boats like this up and down the Amazon,
finding new ways to market their products
[SPEAKER_01]: to people who were still entirely cooking
by scratch, figuring out that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: sell many versions of their products,
and all the big companies are doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the emerging middle class in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sat down, and I spent the next
two days at Nestle, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: to some mildly pleasant applause from the
R&D people, spending time with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at sort of what they were doing to
reformulate their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, it was fairly
impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're trying to minimize or
reduce the amount of salt that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using by taking it out of products
internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And concentrating it on the surface of
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it provides that, what the industry
calls flavor burst sort of immediately to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tongue, and the slide, and the reward
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get basically more bang for
your buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed me how they were taking fat
globules and expanding the surface area so
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have more contact of the fat
with your mouth for, again, bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthfuls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, how they were trying to
replace caloric sweeteners with
[SPEAKER_01]: non-caloric sweeteners in changing some of
their products, like the hot pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's kind of the rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways, I have a bit of a
confession, too, because as much as I
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on salt, sugar, fat, and as much
as I talked about the solution to the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem of companies adding too much salt,
sugar, fat is obviously reducing the salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar, fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk to nutritionists,
that's typically not the first thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they say to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing they will say to you is
that we all need to be doubling the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff that we eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do that, we're going to be way
more than halfway home to better health
[SPEAKER_01]: from the food that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of even the rest of the stuff
will start, to some extent, taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started, and when I asked Nestle
about that, and they're scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, look, okay, I appreciate that
you're reducing the salt, sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: and fat in these products, but what are
you doing to stuff the hot pockets with
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a blank stare because, in fact,
that's one of the most difficult things
[SPEAKER_01]: for the processed food.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food industry now, which is not
decreasing the bad boy ingredients in
[SPEAKER_01]: their products, it's increasing the good
stuff is a real challenge for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started thinking about,
well, what would my food giants,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse the possessive, what would my food
giants do if they suddenly had to start
[SPEAKER_01]: selling fresh vegetables and fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cynics among us would probably
guess, well, they would smother them with
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese sauce or fried caramel glazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, if the rules was that they had to
sell produce as it was without ruining the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional profile of this, what would
they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm convinced they would sort of go to
their tried and true three things that
[SPEAKER_01]: make processed food so successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would make it more convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would make it more, they would lower
the cost of it, and they would do things
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it, if not irresistible,
at least more interesting in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think probably, for the lower the
cost, they would go to the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: community and say, hey guys, remember how
we told you to grow soybeans and field
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, which are the staples of our foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to grow fresh vegetables and
fruits now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, in the Midwest,
I ran across ag extension programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were teaching field corn and soybean
farmers how to switch over to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and increase supply,
if not demand in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lo and behold, I also ran across your very
own Thomas Bjorkman here, who is working
[SPEAKER_01]: on the R&D end of things, because last
time I looked, the industry was spending
[SPEAKER_01]: $2 billion a year on research and
development to make soy and corn more
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable for farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had trouble coming up with a mere
$100 million in research and development
[SPEAKER_01]: for all vegetables and fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an uneven playing field that's
very significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm convinced that my food giants would
increase the amount of money they put into
[SPEAKER_01]: research, into science, to make vegetables
more attractive, more tasty, fresher,
[SPEAKER_01]: more long-lasting, if you will,
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I'm convinced that they
would sort of fiddle around with the
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran across these guys in New Mexico
practicing nudge marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going into supermarkets and
fiddling with the grocery cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did some experiments where they,
in fact, one of these scientists came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Cornell Food Lab, actually,
Colin Payne, and did an experiment where
[SPEAKER_01]: he put some duct tape down the middle of a
grocery cart and a sign in the front
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, put your vegetables in the front
half of the shopping cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that little nudge led to a doubling in
produce sales in the grocery stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they did these experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also was playing around when I
caught up with him with putting mirrors in
[SPEAKER_01]: the front of the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the idea is when you walk into the
grocery store, everything about it is
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to sort of get you off your game
plan and make spontaneous purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions and to kind of forget about who
you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his idea was if we could remind people
of who they were, as they're shopping in
[SPEAKER_01]: the store, they'll reconnect kind of with
the consequences of those purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions and remember the reality outside
the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, what you get is this lala music
and bright colors, and again, sort of this
[SPEAKER_01]: lala atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he started picturing, and I love this
one, because this photo is reflecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: image of the person pushing the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in El Paso.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mirror that they had come up with
was rectangular, and he had suggested
[SPEAKER_01]: turning it this way so he would get the
image of this part of his body,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he had a very substantial stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real biggest thing I think that
the food joints would do to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption of fruits and vegetables would
be to turn to their tried and true friends
[SPEAKER_01]: on Madison Avenue and find those emotional
buttons to push that could drive
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption of vegetables like they drive
consumption of snickers, bars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a while, but I managed to find
an advertising firm to do an ad campaign
[SPEAKER_01]: for me for a vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not any vegetable, but I settled on a
vegetable that tends to cause issues for a
[SPEAKER_01]: good number of people, especially of my
generation if they had parents who cooked
[SPEAKER_01]: it to mush and then made you eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but this advertising
agency agreed to do this campaign and let
[SPEAKER_01]: me watch them do it and videotape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like being inside a madman and
woman segment where they're doing their
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of genius thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to show you a couple of
snippets of the video that we made of
[SPEAKER_01]: their process trying to come up with this
campaign for the problem vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you remember that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and about halfway through the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this went on for weeks and weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are people who can turn
around and add for Porsche in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days, but they were pulling
their hair out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because this was like a real
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's one thing to sell junky stuff
or speed or sex to people, but broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at one point they decide, okay,
look, Michael, you're not giving us any
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in the real world, we probably
wouldn't have money for prime time TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to like start slowly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do some social media campaign stuff
and let's, we're going to pick a fight
[SPEAKER_01]: with a number of other products in the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, oh boy, they're going to go
after, you know, one of my favorites,
[SPEAKER_01]: potato chips, or maybe they're going to go
after French fries in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're forgetting your own book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how you wrote about how the
supposed war between Pepsi and Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_01]: was like a bloody war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it was totally bloodless
because those two companies figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: that every time they attacked each other
or every time Pepsi got Michael Jackson to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with a new ad, the sales of both
companies would rise because it brought
[SPEAKER_01]: buzz to the soda aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they decided to pick a fight with
somebody else in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a video snippet of these
madmen and women actually at work sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: around the table trying to come up with
this, with this campaign strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our key consumer insight that we're
working with is that everyone is currently
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Bon Appetit magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole section on the vegetable
revolution in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a timeline around when all of
these vegetables have their it moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Broccoli is not on the threads.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing new or exciting to say
about broccoli.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to change the visual communication,
visual style of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that drops out at the end, but he said,
is it a bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is how these advertising
people get their juices up by sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: around thinking of silly things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, they came up with a campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up with a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it landed on the cover of the New
York Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still kind of amazed that the New
York Times editors put it in the magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: not to mention on the cover, because it
was entirely fictitious.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no broccoli grower that was
buying this advertising for their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the ad strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, did I hear it from the kale
people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still hearing it from the kale
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was the first lesson
that they learned themselves and they
[SPEAKER_01]: relate to me, which is the last thing in
the world we're going to do is preach.
[SPEAKER_01]: About broccoli, because the government has
been preaching about broccoli to us for
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years and sales haven't
increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have fun and we're going to
recreate broccoli's image to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then something really interesting
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students at another college I won't
mention, but it happens to be in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven, one of the one of the biggest food
deserts in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A university surrounded by fairly poor
people without a lot of shopping options
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to take the campaign advertising
that Victor's and spoils did and create
[SPEAKER_01]: real billboards and real signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they managed to double broccoli sales
in New Haven with their real hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the the rather largest broccoli
grower on the East Coast adopted the alpha
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable strategy that Victor's and
spoils came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having seen that broccoli was a bit of a
wallflower, timid, they decided to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: big and bold and dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, thanks to Thomas, this is one
of their broccoli boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to their website and see a
whole bunch of other sort of advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Obama letter Let's Move
campaign people got the Protus Association
[SPEAKER_01]: folks interested in doing something even
more dramatically powerful, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging some of our celebrities who
endorse the junkiest food products out
[SPEAKER_01]: there to turn around and lend their good
name and good faces to things like
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Protus Association is actually now
doing two experimental programs in two
[SPEAKER_01]: cities where they're trying to measure the
ability of this kind of advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign to to increase sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I'm hoping that if that
data is as strong as it is, they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to convince the produce growers
themselves to start coughing up money for
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, look, there's no there's no way
that that that spinach is ever going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to compete with Skittles for that
reward center of our brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't really have to match it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get close to it to have some dramatic
impact in the grocery store, where other
[SPEAKER_01]: things can happen, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: None other than Wal-Mart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the other day in some of its
stores in West Virginia were rejiggering
[SPEAKER_01]: the physical layout of grocery stores to
increase the presence of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you a little segment of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you because the
answer is they increase sales and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: working because the checkout counter is
actually one of the most dangerous places
[SPEAKER_01]: in the shop or if you're thinking about
health, because the stores know that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when your guard is down and you're
much more apt to impulse buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why the soda companies
started planting refrigerators there with
[SPEAKER_01]: sodas that you could buy at the last
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which brings me to this incredible sort of
moment we're in now where we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge number of startup companies run in
some cases by people from Silicon Valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: other cases, food, ag people like here at
Cornell who are trying to use that awful
[SPEAKER_01]: word disrupt or reinvent sort of all
segments of the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really sort of fun watching them
try to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are coming up with products
like this, which is Soylent, the drink,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But others are coming up with really
interesting things like this, sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: reformulating a ketchup to substitute all
the added sugar with like real vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, the guys who invented
that are a couple of military veterans
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Iraq war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stuff actually tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I'm most
excited about is a number of the people I
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote about in the book who brought us
things like the Lunchables and Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_01]: and Rice Krispie Treats cereal have now
switched sides, having some considerable
[SPEAKER_01]: misgiving about their life work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are now helping some of the
startups scale up by lending some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore formulation and marketing
strategies to these new companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeffrey Dunn of Coca-Cola fame,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He started putting baby carrots in the
vending machines and using advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: like the broccoli campaign to make baby
carrots fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Martin, the guy who invented the Rice
Krispie Treats cereal for Kellogg's is all
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about these things, which are
cargo containers you can plop into any
[SPEAKER_01]: food desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were actually started to be used by
pot growers, but he's got the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: using them for lettuce, throw a little
solar panels on the roof, and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: instant year round accessible and
hopefully affordable greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Sarah Brito from the
Victors and Spoils broccoli campaign who
[SPEAKER_01]: you saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm backing up, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah worked for Kraft and one of her
biggest hits was figuring out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase sales of mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Sarah tells it, she was surveying
neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in Denver and she walked
into one family's house and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting around talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said to them kind of confiding
that, hey, we were just at your neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were telling us how much they
loved Kraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this light bulb went on and the people
she was talking to and they said,
[SPEAKER_01]: really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when Sarah sort of understood
that they could market this as this shared
[SPEAKER_01]: secret among consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she came up with this campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sarah is now working for a group
called The Chef's Collective, a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the restaurant industry,
cooks and what have you, who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvent restaurant menus and the foods in
restaurants to make them just as delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: but healthier for people, a really
treacherous part of our food chain right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in terms of changing people's habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Bob Drain, inventor of
the before-spoken Lunchables.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has started advising a young man named
Luke Saunders who is trying to disrupt one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the more difficult and or treacherous
parts of the food system in this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: the vending machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke, by the way, was an industrial oil
salesman working in the Midwest when he
[SPEAKER_01]: went into a food factory that was making
frozen crustless peanut butter and jelly
[SPEAKER_01]: sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luke said, what parent would serve
these to their kids?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the manager said, it's not parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The schools are buying this because they
no longer have kitchens to cook real food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luke just kind of goes, God,
there's got to be like a better way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this food stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke came up with the farmer's fridge
salad vending machine, which is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fresh salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got 30 or 100 of these in the Chicago
area now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor people, wealthier people are buying
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob Drain is helping him sort of
rethink the marketing strategy for the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer's fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little scary because Drain is
about things like captive audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes to Luke, look, you're putting
these at 7-Elevens, but people drive to
[SPEAKER_01]: the 7-Eleven, and that means they can
drive down the street to Burger King.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to lose a lot of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you park these things in like a
big office building where you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: captive audience, a targeted captive
audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this hardcore expression that may
be a little scary for food startup people
[SPEAKER_01]: who aren't used to thinking about their
lovely product in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, by the way, is the original
strategic marketing for Lunchable that
[SPEAKER_01]: made it so focused and so cunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob is trying to help Luke come up
with a sort of similar marketing strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Lunchables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, eventually, I think that going
back to Nestle, that if you could use the
[SPEAKER_01]: tried and true food industry methods of
lowering cost, increasing convenience,
[SPEAKER_01]: and increasing demand, that you'll not
just get more product produce sales in the
[SPEAKER_01]: produce aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll get the food giants
themselves more keen on using more
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and or fruits in their products
throughout the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't even have to do the Walmart
thing and put bananas at the checkout
[SPEAKER_01]: counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the essence of those bananas
in food products where you don't anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: today and all the lovely nutritional value
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's always the food giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are trying their best now to
reinvent their products, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a recent tasting in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn, where Kellogg's had a stand
[SPEAKER_01]: where they were adding things like pork
fat to Rice Krispies cereal, which is sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of their way of trying to reinvent their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: They may succeed in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this, maybe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe they'll just go back to this sort
of tried and true method, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that with a little bit of help
from the food giants and their marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies, a lot of these startups
themselves can really start scaling up and
[SPEAKER_01]: make a really big difference in our eating
habits and public health as a result of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I always forget that,
but this rather but as I work on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: book, I'm still out there engaging with
people and tweeting through this address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you want to keep in touch
with me on that scale, I'd be glad to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the other beautiful thing about
fruits and vegetables is you can do some
[SPEAKER_01]: processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can freeze, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of my favorite things to buy
this time of year, frozen blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if frozen correctly, could actually
make a lot more ethical, moral sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: health sense than trying to buy fresh
blueberries imported from who knows where.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's actually a lot of
cunning processing that the industry could
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I mean, processing is not
necessarily an evil word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, I'm not about being
anti-all food processing, otherwise I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be eating my favorite cheeses,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about controlling processed foods
rather than letting them control us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that knowing as the food
industries know that more and more people
[SPEAKER_01]: are caring about what they put in their
bodies and they're starting to make
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase decisions based on that,
I think they'll understand that they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: ruin those things and they may be able to
incorporate them into products where
[SPEAKER_01]: people need some convenience in their
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the good news is that I think in
many other countries, including France,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's sort of more mindfulness about
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the folks at the food lab
here at Cornell have really paid close
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to that issue of mindfulness,
because it does seem like there was this
[SPEAKER_01]: moment in the 1980s when suddenly
overnight we became mindless about food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became socially acceptable to eat
anything, anywhere, anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you started to see people
walk down the street and eating and
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking and bringing food into business
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I opened up a bag of chips right
now and had a little snack, you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be that shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that played right into the hands of
the food companies and making us less
[SPEAKER_01]: mindful about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started to engineer products
you could eat with one hand and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: need utensils while you were doing
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to snacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Becoming this fourth American meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in France still, people think
we're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why would you want to ruin your
appetite before having a meal where you
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to sit down with friends and
family and linger for a couple of hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying kind of the sociability as well
as the food itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changing, though, but because
American processed foods are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread around the world, not just Saudi
Arabia or Brazil, where I showed Nestle's
[SPEAKER_01]: boat, but in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're seeing increasing obesity
and diabetes in lots of the developed
[SPEAKER_01]: world as well, where the convenience in
the allure of processed foods and or kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the craziness of their lives is making
them more dependent on American style
[SPEAKER_01]: processed foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to really hate the idea of the
soda tax as being regressive and hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: poor people who are paying the tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've sort of come around on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's funny, because I put that
question to Jeff Beibel, the former CEO
[SPEAKER_01]: Philip Morris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in his Australian accent, which I
can't mimic, he said to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, look, I'm no fan of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to food, I mean,
you have to remember these food companies
[SPEAKER_01]: are so viciously competitive for space on
the grocery shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are becoming so concerned about
food these days that I think it could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually behoove the food companies to
take it upon themselves actually to
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest some regulation relating to
nutrition, if only to sort of give them
[SPEAKER_01]: cover from Wall Street, because they're
all under tremendous pressure to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that pressure has just increased year
after year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was sort of Jeff Beibel's sense
was it would be in the industry's own
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to sort of reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think they're going to accept
it coming the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's just this inherent
resistance to having government
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention, especially if it doesn't
make any sense to the food companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather see the change come from
the food companies themselves finding ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue making money with healthier
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're starting to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, let's go try some food.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
