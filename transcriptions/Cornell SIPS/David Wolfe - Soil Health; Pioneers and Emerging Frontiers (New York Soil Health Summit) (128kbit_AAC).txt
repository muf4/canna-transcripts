[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of my sort of overview talk
is Soil Health Pioneers and Emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: Frontiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already introduced myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more about my bio in the handout
you've got, so I will without further ado
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been exciting to me as someone
who's been working on this at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: since about 20 years ago is when Cornell
first started working in the area of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health and it's just a great merging of an
era in the science, particularly the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology and soil ecology of major
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our old petri dish techniques,
we really hardly knew what was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with terms of microbial community in the
soil, but with molecular biology learning
[SPEAKER_00]: much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing biodiversity and abundance
and learning that almost all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things are very beneficial for farming and
learning how to manipulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those I talked about in my
book that came out about 15 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: called Tales from the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this blended with was at the same
time that we were having these amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries about learning more about life
underground, the farmers were becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide and in New York in particular,
farmers becoming aware that while we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had continued productivity, even increased
productivity over the past century,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of cases this is coming at the
expense of our soils gradually degrading,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly losing organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of farmer motivation to do
something to rebuild their organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: make their soils more productive,
more resilient, and this also blended with
[SPEAKER_00]: also new information we never had before
about the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more we're learning today about
soil health, human health, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, all those links.
[SPEAKER_00]: That farmer aspect was really captured in
a book by my colleague Harold Dines,
[SPEAKER_00]: who can't be here today, Building Soils
for Better Crops, kind of really a how-to
[SPEAKER_00]: for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the farmers have been very
familiar with this and cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been through numerous editions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold wrote that with Fred Magdoff from
University of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we have our most recent book
here I've got on the list, the one we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hear about this afternoon from
David Montgomery at University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Growing a Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that book, he does a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I like, why we wanted
him today for this talk, he really does a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job of capturing the history,
the worldwide movement happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: farming and how we really are on the cusp
of a major revolution in farming and puts
[SPEAKER_00]: it in that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we know today that
we had no idea about when I was in grad
[SPEAKER_00]: school through age myself, but it really
wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to grad school, that was
plants and what their roots do is take up
[SPEAKER_00]: water and nutrients for the plants and
anchor the plant in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know now that what's probably as
equally an important thing of what plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do is what their roots exude into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release a fair amount of the sugars
from photosynthesis, which attracts
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria to them and helps them,
those bacteria can help them mine the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: around them for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exude trace amounts of chemicals that
inhibit weeds, insects, and disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: attract all kinds of beneficial microbes
to them, and also can release substances
[SPEAKER_00]: that literally dissolve nutrients in the
soil that they otherwise couldn't acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that we really
appreciate more is how roots forge their
[SPEAKER_00]: way through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly with compacted soil,
some of them are able to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: help break up compaction in a more natural
way instead of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this creates pathways,
water, oxygen for other roots and perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crops to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they're all sequestering,
these roots are sequestering carbon deep
[SPEAKER_00]: in the profile, which otherwise would be
in the air as the greenhouse gas carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without going into a lot of details
about all this kind of research,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of this is going into our thinking
about rotation crops today and fall winter
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops, learning not just the amount
of biomass they produce, which of course
[SPEAKER_00]: is important, getting organic matter back
into the soil, crucial to soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these other things they might do for
particular problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is Sudan grass, which would be
familiar to many of you who are farmers or
[SPEAKER_00]: working with farmers in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sudan grass is now known to release a
compound called sorgolion, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress weeds and also pathogenic
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got that kind of problem,
this is a good prescriptive rotation crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got compacted soils,
this is a good one to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its roots are very capable of getting into
compacted soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course also it's pumping organic
matter deep into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I say, these plants and these
substances they're releasing are not only
[SPEAKER_00]: important in their own life cycle,
but can be very valuable to a subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's this plant legacy of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this work is going into what's
happening with cover crop research today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big thing about cover crops,
and this is where really farmers I think
[SPEAKER_00]: take the lead and often lead us as much as
we lead them for sure, is how to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we accept and understand that,
for example, using fall winter cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and keeping the ground covered,
increases our biomass and have all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to integrate that into our cash
cropping systems in the short growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many farmers are really leading the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing a picture of some
interseeding of a cover crop into a corn
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These techniques for really integrating
this into our cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of exciting stuff going on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hear more about that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I talked about new stuff,
new discoveries about what roots do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course then there's the whole thing
about all of this sorgola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these things we're learning about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to roots, possibly of some
species releasing substances that control
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, pests, and disease, certain
microbes can help us in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically biological control in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That top picture, a cute little picture of
the mouth part of a nematode, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic worm that's abundant in many
different species in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them are parasitic to plants,
but hundreds of these species are in
[SPEAKER_00]: almost any handful of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bacterial feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mouth part of a bacterial feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microbes of course are very
important in nitrogen cycling and
[SPEAKER_00]: essential to all life on the planet
actually play an important role in making
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of essential nutrients for
plants and for humans actually available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they play important roles in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nitrogen fixation, that's something many
people are familiar with, legume crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have a picture there below that
nematode is showing some tiny rhizobium
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latching onto the soybean root,
a root hair of a soybean plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a legume plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will invade the root, welcomed by
the plants because they will capture
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen from the air spaces in the soil
in exchange for photosynthes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're learning more about how to
maximize these sorts of symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these creatures that are in the
soil and the large abundance of them
[SPEAKER_00]: release sticky substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the fungi that are in the
soil release those fine hyphae that help
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the soil together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to good soil aggregation,
which is amazingly just critical to water
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity and good drainage in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is completely dead,
you'll have very poor soil aggregation,
[SPEAKER_00]: without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the roots themselves,
some of the substances they release,
[SPEAKER_00]: help hold soils together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another crucial thing for
grabbing flooding resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all new information working
into our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide from Majinikan Niffin,
a researcher at Cornell Soil Biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who unfortunately had a family emergency
and couldn't be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where she lives, in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very narrow zone of soil, just within
millimeters of the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pull up a plant, there's that soil
that sticks to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the rhizosphere,
just that really narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hotspot of plant-soil interactions
involving microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, most of them are microbiota
that we're called for that send out
[SPEAKER_00]: signals to attract those microbiota to
benefit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're learning a lot about
controlling that rhizosphere and making
[SPEAKER_00]: the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny's research really works a lot on,
OK, so the microbial community,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many farmers, of course, have always
been concerned about disease organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we maximize those good guys in
the soil that might have these positive
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on our plant and suppress the
pathogens and those others?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of work on compost and
various ways to manipulate the soil for
[SPEAKER_00]: that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned pioneers, and I wanted to
mention at least one or two going quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: ways back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dr. Salman Wassman, who is a
professor at Rutgers University,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the first kind of true university
accredited, you might say, soil biologists
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the 1920s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had grown up on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was convinced, having grown up on a
farm, he saw so many diseased plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: animals turned into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow the soil doesn't just continue
becoming more and more toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was convinced there had to be,
he coined the term antibiotics in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that helped purify the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time he was working,
penicillin had been discovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was the only antibiotic we really
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a long story short, after years of
research, he discovered stiffomysin and
[SPEAKER_00]: got the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1952.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming much more to the present time,
another kind of something that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: just about started about 15, 20 years ago
is a lot of talk about soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the country, around the world,
and here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this thing of what, it's kind of a
wishy washy phrase, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Cornell really has been at the
forefront of, one of the things been at
[SPEAKER_00]: the forefront of, is really developing a
new kind of soil test for the 21st century
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes beyond just the chemistry of
soils, which is what our parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, acidity, then calcium and magnesium,
then nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also integrating into the soil test
biological and physical indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have time to go into a lot of
detail about Cornell's comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of soil health program,
but we have a table in the back right,
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron, that's got some information about
this and the website there, for those of
[SPEAKER_00]: you interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, of course, groups
working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always updating this and improving
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to talk a little bit about
tillage now, because I talked about one
[SPEAKER_00]: way of rebuilding our soils, building
organic matter, is this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining vegetative cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically, as much of the year as
possible, sucking CO2 out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere and some of that ends up in the
soil as organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens when we plow and till the
soil is that over oxygenates the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: it really accelerates microbial activity
that's in the business of breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with microbes doing
that, but if they do it way too fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so-called, it fans the flames of
excessive organic matter decomposition and
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients disappear before plants
can even acquire them and are leached out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often, this problem of too much
tillage often begins with a problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you have compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer thinks I've got to go out there
and till it and plow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get on this vicious circle of
compaction leading to increased tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then leads to declining organic
matter because you're oxygenating the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less organic matter, less food for the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food web, fewer soil microbes there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reduces soil aggregation,
poorer soil drainage, and the soils are
[SPEAKER_00]: more under compaction, a vicious cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to get away from this is still
may need some tillage for very severe
[SPEAKER_00]: cases of course, but also integrating into
this the idea of using cover crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: may biologically with their roots help
break up the compaction or actually
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about things such as earthworms
and the work they can do in helping break
[SPEAKER_00]: up these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of pioneers, it seems like as a
biologist, no matter what I'd get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles Darwin was there before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was a soil biologist too.
[SPEAKER_00]: His last book, for those of you who don't
know, some of you may know about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: was a 200 page book on earthworms and the
important role they played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before this, many people just called them
as parasitic creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quote from him, the plow was one of the
most ancient and most valuable of man's
[SPEAKER_00]: inventions, but long before he existed,
the land was in fact regularly plowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: still continuously plowed by earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last, I just want to mention one other
kind of technique for rebuilding our soils
[SPEAKER_00]: is directly adding organic matter to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of compost or manures,
and biochar is something that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a pure carbon substance that can
be fortified in various ways or attract
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes to it and be a benefit to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll hear a little bit more about
that, I'm sure today as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another avenue, reducing tillage,
cover crops, directly adding soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments such as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just a few slides left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about what's really
exciting also, and we had a meeting just
[SPEAKER_00]: before this morning, talking about all
these win-win aspects of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that farmers are motivated
to do strictly from the bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining productivity of their soils
and improving their climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience, resilience to extreme weather
events, particularly drought and flooding
[SPEAKER_00]: and erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reasons I mentioned, better aggregate
stability, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it's what we call a natural
geoengineering solution for carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that organic matter we store in the
soil, that's carbon, it's usually 60% or
[SPEAKER_00]: so of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's carbon, where would that be
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be in the air as the greenhouse gas,
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why there's this interest in
this linking of soil health and climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, just a couple more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to emphasize is that we are
not in New York here, way in the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: the line about soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really been at the forefront,
farmers and researchers and our agencies
[SPEAKER_00]: like Ag and Markets, our environmental
conservation, also USDA NRCS are working
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at this for more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little picture I pulled up from
my slide, that's George Dowie,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of you may know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a plant pathologist, he's recently
retired plant pathologist at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped form our first soil health
program work team along with myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold Danness at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this really, we were responding to,
you see those growers there, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to their interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Donnie Brand's in that
picture, but it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our door panel members,
I think was part of that first team.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to focus on today is,
especially as we move towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day is, yes, we've done these great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hear some of the cool
things everybody's doing, working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we really, why isn't everybody
adopting these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still are a long way from full
adoption and maximizing and fully
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to move forward and we'll talk
more about that during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, just specifically about our
project, New York Soil Health,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's kind of what our near-term
objectives that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identifying barriers to water adoption,
we're using soil surveys, farmer surveys,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, other ways of looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find economic and environmental
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing a lot of farmers ask that are
interested in this is, yes, I see and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about these benefits, but how long
will it take for me to see those benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be two years, five years,
20 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we'll see in one of our
presentations later this afternoon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends on which benefit you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does vary and we're trying to get
better information about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovative cropping systems and soil
ecology research, we'll hear about that
[SPEAKER_00]: from a number of our speakers today and
some of them have been funded through our
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research on biochar and compost,
another thing, another area of research
[SPEAKER_00]: we're funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very relevant to what's
happening today and very big part of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York Soil Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's everybody, it's not a
Cornell thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really promoting statewide
communication, coordination, and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our major goals is almost
accomplished and there's several hours
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the first statewide Soil Health
Summit and we hope it's the first of
[SPEAKER_00]: others to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also something we hope to accomplish
at the beginning, I get some input from
[SPEAKER_00]: you later today, gathering input from the
full range of stakeholders for our New
[SPEAKER_00]: York Soil Health roadmap in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already, many of you are involved
in that already and we'll get input from
[SPEAKER_00]: more of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
