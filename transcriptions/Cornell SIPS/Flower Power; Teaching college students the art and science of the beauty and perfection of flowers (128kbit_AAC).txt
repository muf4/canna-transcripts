[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of consider Cornell to be one of
the pillars, one of the origins of
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of an interesting
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a lot of talks about
teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I don't like to give talks about
teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that most of the time,
you know, we research scientists aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: invited to talk about our teaching stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're invited to talk about our research
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to blaze through some of
the various things that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm basically going to be,
I'll give you a little background about
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil just gave quite a bit of it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to talk a little bit about
my research and my extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talk a little bit about our
teaching programs at UC Davis that relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant sciences and relating to what
I'm presenting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with that context, I will dive
into talking about the course that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: come to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of this you just learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the core is that I have a number of
different things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first half of my career was
focused pretty much on ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm focused more widely on this
book on the market, Soilless Culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: is one that Michael Raviv and I put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of the definitive guide on
the field of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look really, really carefully,
this guy in the red shirt right there is
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember this spot in Columbia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so.
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're a cover girl kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I have research and instruction
as part of my makeup for my position at UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 25% for instruction and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a big chunk of agricultural
experiment station and then a pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk for cooperative extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually am a specialist and connect
with the advisors in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the years, I've done quite a
bit of work with greenhouses and with
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last few years, I've also
started looking at indoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: People used to talk to me about indoor
production as to whether that might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told them that was nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would talk to me about vertical
production and I'd say, that's nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now I'm aiming directly
into that direction and will be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things in that field because
actually it's some interesting things have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a couple of, I'm just
going to blast a few screens here of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the work that I've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing a couple of things with
lettuce, looking at various facets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some work with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time I work with strawberries,
I swear I will never work with
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's too much political baggage and
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we had this project where we
were looking at root zone temperatures on
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and still looking at orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, for the early part of my career,
I did a lot of work with cut flower roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wanted to work on orchids,
but I could never get any money due to
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ended up finally doing some work
with orchids, but largely from the
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of trying to see if we can grow
potted orchids hydroponically,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of course is a completely oxymoronic
thing because our education to our
[SPEAKER_00]: students about orchids is don't water them
more than once a week because you will
[SPEAKER_00]: kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, if you're going to try to do
orchids hydroponically, you will kill a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of orchids, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you'd like me to tell you the
secret of that, wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been working on a photovoltaic
shade house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nursery structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, every outdoor nursery has a
screen house, maybe even several screen
[SPEAKER_00]: houses at different levels of shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided that it would make good
sense to do one that, instead of throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight away, make it into
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this house, I have one second section
that takes 70% of the intercepted light,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% of sunlight goes through the plants,
and another section where it's roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get about 35% shading, and that makes
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other portion, the plants get
the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is my photovoltaic shade
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever want to come to Davis and
visit, you should probably sign up to
[SPEAKER_00]: visit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not be the only one visiting
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also become a tour guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once a week, at least, I give a tour
of the shade house to whoever wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: come see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very catchy, very
eye-catching thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you're going to see in a
minute that I'm going to make it even more
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-catching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of the largest things
I've ever built at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing that I've ever had to
do a research project where I had to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: power pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an interesting thing,
but I needed to connect my photovoltaic
[SPEAKER_00]: production to the grid so that the
electricity could go somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had no other use for the
electricity myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you may be aware, in the container
nursery production, you really don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of use for electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a little bit to run the timers
and maybe some pumps for irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but beyond that, we don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that also spurred in my mind a number
of ideas about the fact that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have this kind of thing and you
have the electricity right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there are some other things you can
do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually installed some screen
compartments in there with the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing some cooling in those
screen compartments, because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I'm also doing a lot of
work with plant production lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at supplemental lighting in a
variety of ways, photoperiodic lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly looking at the new
technologies that are coming on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and have been coming on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm particularly fascinated with LED
lighting, because I can get monochromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting or sort of monochromatic
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, we are starting to see
things that we've never seen before in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture in terms of what we can do
with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LED lighting, for those of you who are
not familiar with the concept,
[SPEAKER_00]: stands for light-emitting diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are now almost everywhere you can
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key facet to them is that the
prices have been coming down on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were initially touted as being more
energy-efficient than light bulbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: than other kinds of light sources,
but this was kind of a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big facets to LED lighting
is that we can actually construct a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that we want to deliver to the
plants so that we can leave out things
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants technically don't need,
or we think that the plants might not
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make a lamp that makes
absolutely no green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a lamp that makes no infrared
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we have sort of a unique
situation with this device in that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: light comes off one side of the device,
and heat goes off both the back and the
[SPEAKER_00]: front, you can actually take the heat off
the back, and you can channel that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: away without obstructing the light itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot do that with conventional
light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see people in growth
environments where they have growth rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: with HID lamps, generally there's a big
effort to try to get all that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: channeled off so it doesn't get down to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With LED lights, you can hold your hand
under the LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not feel any warmth from the
lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a kind of unique feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually some other unique
features that LED lamps also have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the things that I'm
particularly focused on trying to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, this technology has been
focused primarily on replacing HID lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's actually a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the HID lamps are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hang LED lamps in their place,
thinking that you're going to replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: HID lamps, you're going to have to do some
very special engineering to get the money
[SPEAKER_00]: back, because right now those are much,
much more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the return on investment is
significantly lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it a certain way,
and you can structure it so this very
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-centric, then you will have lower
energy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are then able to do some things
that you can't do with HID lamps,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as switching them on and off very
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, if you try to switch an HID
lamp on and off, well, once you switch it
[SPEAKER_00]: off, you're going to wait 15 minutes for
it to come back fully on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you'll wear out the lamp
really fast if you switch it on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, solid state lighting doesn't work
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can switch it on and off very rapidly,
especially if it's designed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a number of different things
that I'm looking at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is looking at
whether we can use lighting to control
[SPEAKER_00]: various things on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we are orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the spike length on
orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really see a very dramatic
difference between orchids growing under
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light and orchids growing under red
light, with the red light being much more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable to spike elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, I'm figuring that we
can use the blue light to keep plants
[SPEAKER_00]: short.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't found a way yet to do that
in a reliable fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I'm building a plant growth
facility, which is an indoor plant growing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we're actually building it
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting right next to my shade house,
my photovoltaic array.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually now completed from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, we're building the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has eight layers of production
inside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now no longer talking about
two-dimensional production in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but three-dimensional
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very much a vertical
production situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, it consumes a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have yet to consume all the
electricity that I'm producing on my PV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody wants to argue with me about
CO2 footprint, I am yet taking CO2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: making it into biomass, not the other way
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, this is gearing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to have about 300-some shelf
space areas to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's kind of my overview of
my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I'm going to say right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you ask me about some of my
research projects later on, I'm obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my mission here today is to talk about
some teaching things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I want to talk a little
bit about plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that in the context of how we
do undergraduate and graduate education at
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a plant sciences program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant sciences at UC Davis is the
emerging of four different departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually should have merged five
departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them, they had too much money
and too much good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to dilute that by sharing
that with environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other three departments,
veg crops, agronomy, and range science,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pomology, they agreed that we should
form one team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it was driven by teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realized that our weakness at UC Davis
was our undergraduate teaching in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is despite the fact that we know
that we are the number one plant biology
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate teaching program in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our mind, you might think this can't
possibly be, but in our mind, the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences part was defective while the
plant biology was nationally number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figured that in order to get our
plant sciences teaching up to that level,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that change motivated us to unite into
one program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we have programs that range from
molecular, genomics, genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly do physiology and biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in horticulture, we certainly have a
lot of production horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also landscape and urban horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The undergraduate majors that we have,
we have one called environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture and urban forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically ornamental horticulture
with a name that nobody can find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enough students keep finding it year
after year where it's a sustained major
[SPEAKER_00]: with about 40 students in it at any one
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that we would not take it
apart and merge it into something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have started a plant sciences
undergraduate major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might remember that UC Davis
used to have a plant sciences
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate major back in the 1980s and
1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, we disassembled that because we
thought that we didn't need to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then now that we're a plant sciences
department, we've put that teaching back
[SPEAKER_00]: on the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have related majors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an undergraduate major in plant
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a biotechnology major that has
three components with plants being one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sustainable agriculture as a brand
new major.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the graduate program side,
we have the horticulture and agronomy
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually where I take most of my
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a plant biology graduate group,
which is actually where Neil got his PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an ecology graduate program
and a genetics graduate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those all have PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have PhD programs as part of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant sciences, I believe,
is right now in the 20s, 30s, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, growing because it started
brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have any track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's accumulating students.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sustainable agriculture is about the
same size and also growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biotech is in the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant side of that is actually not
the biggest chunk of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are typically somewhere between
50 and 70 students in the biotech side
[SPEAKER_00]: that are plant focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually quite a diversity of
what an undergraduate student can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually specifically decided to
leave it that way because I think that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to meet the needs of the
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my courses that I teach, I teach
greenhouse and nursery production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got through teaching that winter
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our winter quarter ended last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally that is focused
primarily on ornamentals because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what in California is mostly the
greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm starting to put more in on
hydroponics and on vegetable production
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're seeing some growth in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach a graduate course on modeling,
modeling horticultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this course that I'm going to
talk to you about here today called Flower
[SPEAKER_00]: Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's three courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've kept tabs on my teaching
appointment, that is a success for failure
[SPEAKER_00]: if somebody with 25% teaching teaches this
much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, it's been a pretty tough road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a road I'm on because I choose
to be on this road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite the fact that I don't have
enough INR for it, I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to say my colleagues
tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, I don't think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the course I'm here to
talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the title of the course,
Flower Power, the Application of the Art
[SPEAKER_00]: and Science of the Beauty and Perfection
of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that make you want to take the
course?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have told people this on airplanes
sitting next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, oh, can I take that course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do an online version?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're seeing the power of
marketing right here, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your personal feelings should have somehow
just sort of popped up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, I got to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I usually tell people is,
well, you have to be a student,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferably an undergraduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk to you about how this
course came about because this was not
[SPEAKER_00]: dictated by any major, by any body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody said, we need this course taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you teach it?
[SPEAKER_00]: This course, I invented this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I invented it on the path that I'm
going to show you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2007, I was doing a project for the
USDA Foreign Act Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a project to do a week-long
workshop on flower production in
[SPEAKER_00]: Montenegro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question I have to ask you,
do you know where Montenegro is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you even know is that a country or a
city or, unfortunately, some people think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a continent, but no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montenegro is a little country in the
Balkans, right here where this arrow is
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as such, it is a place where
Americans don't go, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europeans go there on vacation
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a particular particularly
thriving place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what happened there,
say, 20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big war.
[SPEAKER_00]: People butchered each other and killed
each other and shot each other up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people moved around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The former Yugoslavia was disintegrating,
had disintegrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Serbians were unhappy with the
Kosovoans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Montenegrins were stuck in between
because they're right between the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a place of war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started looking at this in
2007, I found myself being asked to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I asked, well, why is the USDA
doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, we're collaborating with the
Department of State because we need to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that place to be peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get the place to be
peaceful, we need to boost their capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: in all areas of agriculture, all areas of
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we can do, the more we can boost
it, the more these people will understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's better to not be at war than to
kill each other over what little they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I was leaving to fly over there,
my wife gave me a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the book she gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I ought to read this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking, yeah, yeah,
yeah, honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't read books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the plane, with nothing better to
do, OK, sometimes I actually read a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I opened the book on the plane,
I had a bit of a revelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I knew the main
characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually the very first bit of
text in the book, introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the first thing a person does when
you hand them flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Butzka, General Manager of the San
Francisco Flower Market, asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, I know Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's me standing with Bob on one of
our student field trips, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking at this thing and said,
whoa, I'm reading a book, published book,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Times bestselling book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the character on the page one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I keep reading through it,
I find more and more characters that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read all this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my class, this is actually how I
open up the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them exactly what I've just told
you, how the class came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually read them this out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, then when they go off and have
to do their reading, they will already
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of be sucked into this world and will
read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the book is by Amy Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expose on the flower industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fundamentally, between those of us who
do flower culture, we've been to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: She visited as part of her research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen the Colombians, the
Ecuadorians, the Dutch, the Asians,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things she talks about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's like, oh, this would
be a great freshman seminar kind of course
[SPEAKER_00]: where I could essentially, I can use this
book as the course outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do any work to design the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, at each chapter that they
go through, one chapter per week,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just show them my slides from
visiting those places and the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I figured it would be a really
easy course to put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the flight back from Montenegro,
I sketched out the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got back to Davis, I proposed
it as a freshman seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The administration liked it, and we
offered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the freshman seminar style course at
UC Davis is a 15 max enrollment course.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's kind of like, oh,
man, do I want to do that much work for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: students?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I said, OK, I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly because I figured I didn't
have to do any work, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just get up there, pull out my slide
sets, and stick through them, and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I arrive at the first day of
class, and there are 40 students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is impossible because this is a
conference room type room, which is not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually had to have registered for
this to know where the room was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 15 people were actually
registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 40 were sitting in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, what the heck are all of
you doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 of you were in the wrong room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't have a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, there's a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, there were 10 people on the
waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these 10 people on the waiting list
were waiting for people to not take the
[SPEAKER_00]: class, people to drop so they could slide
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest were waiting to get on the
waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a sign of things to come,
because I can tell you this course has
[SPEAKER_00]: done some really weird things that I've
never seen any other course do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I did after I thought
as a freshman seminar, I decided,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this has nothing to do with
freshmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't need to be for freshmen only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody should be able to take this,
anybody that has an interest in flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I turned it into a special topics
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it quickly filled whatever room I
picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I had a room that took
like 50 seats, and 50 students showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I took a classroom that had 128
seats, 128 students showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it filled the capacity of every room I
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a course that's
specifically designed to give students
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on account of that, it has word of
mouth appeal in addition to having this
[SPEAKER_00]: flower appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key that I was trying to do with
this course is construct a course in such
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that it would give students the
things they need at the time when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: registering, because that's when they're
signing up for courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that a lot of students need
is they need a small few units to fill out
[SPEAKER_00]: a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want this filler to be some
heavy duty organic chemistry course.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they want the exact opposite of
an organic chemistry course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, by the way, in case you didn't
notice this, is probably why horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: students come to horticulture,
because they figure they can get away from
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other courses that are a
little difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want an interesting material,
no stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, they prefer it to have pass,
no pass grading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also learned that many of them would
have liked to have this course be general
[SPEAKER_00]: ed, but general ed is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means I've got to grade papers and do
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, let's try it without that,
see if we get enough people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want it as a compact place in the
schedule late afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now a filler for their schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to come at a time, not in the
mornings, when all these other courses are
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicting with each other, but late in
the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I built this exactly to that
specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the course is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have absolutely no problem with this
being a filler, because to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as they're paying their
registration and the money somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: trickles down to where it needs to go,
I get paid either way, whether the student
[SPEAKER_00]: is in my major or not, or whether it's a
heavy duty science course or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes no difference from the standpoint
of... And you know, it's up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: student.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't want to take it,
they don't have to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not required in any major.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is accessible to any major.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it has science content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many majors, it counts for the
science in that major.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now a regular UC Davis course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Plan Science 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our designated number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is designed as a survey of
floriculture, two units, pass,
[SPEAKER_00]: no pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs 10 weeks, one late afternoon
meeting per week, usually Tuesday
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoons, in the most comfortable
lecture hall I can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has to have nice padded seats,
has to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be the kind of thing where on
Tuesday afternoon at four o'clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they come in, they sit down and they
let... I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, this is a destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a destination during the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you the students come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also do just a little bit of testing
with the multiple choice questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not difficult exams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's pass, no pass,
they are...
[SPEAKER_00]: They can usually pass without doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spring 2013, enrollment was 170.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that classroom became too full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided, well, let's go for a bigger
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found another lecture hall had 370,
369 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year I had 300 students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently enrollment is at 360,
nine more probably by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will have a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this waiting list will probably be 40
students long.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the course of spring, the first few
days of spring quarter, I will lose
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 50 of these students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a filler in their schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of students park something there
because they can't find something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is parked there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some students end up with it there,
particularly after the first day of
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of students drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they need something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to do their majors stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have a fairly long waiting list,
it will all still shuffle in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I end up with a class that's
nearly full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm expecting 2015, my enrollment,
to be about 350 at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably what it's going to settle
down for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly the undergraduate students are
interested in floor culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually a bit of a
revelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because up until this point, everybody
that I ever talked to about floor culture
[SPEAKER_00]: said, oh, this is a minor niche thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students aren't interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students don't care about this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, we were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you some of the various
facets that are embedded into this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about how flowers are produced,
how the florist gets them, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale side of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach them some common names of flowers,
the whole idea being is that if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go into a flower shop and buy
flowers, they've got to know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if they're going to go buy a CD,
they need to know the bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to know them by their used
names, not by their Latin names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give them the Latin names also
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm primarily interested in learning
the common names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how to handle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about post-service handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that, they get a lecture on
how to do the post-service handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get some facets of the science about
genetically modified organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: about botany, plant biology, horticulture,
and floor culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of a toned down part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's woven enough into it to hopefully
generate some interest among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them might actually take our
other plant science courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the reading and
discussion is centered around the book
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower Confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indeed, I do exactly as what I
initially planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of various things that seem
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, it's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluffy by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a great donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell me you don't like great donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have art in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, art, after all, is in the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I forgot to tell you is when I tried
to get that title through the courses
[SPEAKER_00]: committee, they said, no, no, you can't
have that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: That title is too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the title of this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Flowers and Their Uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for word of mouth that I don't
have to count on somebody actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: in the catalog to be marketed my course
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I use this title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use this title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it has art in the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the students do an art project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, these are some of the
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them do a little panel with a
letter of their choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, they had to use the first
letter of their last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they then have to find a flower,
look it up, find out what it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like, and give me some art,
some original art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to do it in this particular
format because I have other uses for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you see, I have letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spell interesting things with what
they give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always a few people who just
can't be bothered to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did that in second grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like second grade stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a flower arranging workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, last year we did nine separate
workshops during one particular week
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of that week's lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did, actually me and my staff,
we did as much work that entire week that
[SPEAKER_00]: week as the entire rest of the quarter
combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to say I'm never doing that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am going to do it one more time this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see in a few minutes why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students actually love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might think, ah, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of guys who aren't
going to get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually quite interesting,
this particular person right here you
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be able to tell, but this person
is blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with a student with that
kind of a disability in a course like
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these flowers to a blind person are
just as potent as to a seeing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just they sense something different.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So her bouquet was going to be,
she wasn't going to put stuff in it that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a bunch of things from this
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really happy this student came on
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had no clue how I would teach
this material to a blind person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have learned more from watching
her learn the material than I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in one lecture, I give every student
a flowering potted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens about the third week of the
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the student is given this plant with
the instruction that they have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some impact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first question that usually comes
back is, can I make impact on myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I usually say to this,
well, you're going to have a writing
[SPEAKER_00]: assignment where you have to describe what
impact you made with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to write about how it made
an impact on you, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would caution you that that might be
a little bit more difficult than giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: to your mother and your mother being just
exuberant about it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, they have to do a writing
assignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an essay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a particularly long thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there have been some very memorable
essays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, I still recall one young
Asian student who took a white
[SPEAKER_00]: chrysanthemum to her mother and nearly got
thrown out of the family for doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know why, then you need to
come take the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you see, in the Asian culture,
you need to understand what a white
[SPEAKER_00]: chrysanthemum represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a much more strong
representation in Asian culture than these
[SPEAKER_00]: meanings of flowers have in our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this young lady should have known
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow in her upbringing,
that wasn't imprinted on her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But her mother, who was Chinese,
was very much imprinted and had been ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now getting this white flower,
which was supposed to pepper up,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, in that culture, the white
chrysanthemum is a funeral flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the kinds of essays I'm
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least some percentage are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discussed some very difficult
dilemmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a friend has a birthday, are flowers
worth more than balloons or chocolates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it OK to bribe somebody with flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might want to think about this
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's OK if you want something
good to happen to give somebody flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it OK to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not OK to give them money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not OK to give them a bottle of wine
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers you can get away with things
that you can't get with any other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a power tool of extraordinary
proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, this is why the course is called
Flower Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because flowers, in fact, have a power
that nothing else around us has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so students learned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I try to get in and
get them to think a little bit more than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the flower itself, but looking at
colors and patterns and depth and potmums
[SPEAKER_00]: versus orchids and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to give them a sense of value
with respect to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually making a presentation
about this course to the book board of the
[SPEAKER_00]: American Floral Endowment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was explaining to them one thing
that these students had told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I learned from them is
that they would buy flowers if they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Davis, the campus is like its own
little city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no flower shops on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a student wants to get flowers,
they've got to go to one of the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: stores or to one of the big box stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, they can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do that, they've got to take a bus
to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're going on their bicycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eh, are they going to be lugging flowers
on their bicycles?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what kind of extraordinary length
a student needs to go through to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're going to your friends,
those of you who are not students,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a working adult and you're going
to visit some friends, you'd have no
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble finding flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd pick them up on the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the hands of these students,
they have a difficult time with this
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have good access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, it's not being
marketed to them at all, largely because
[SPEAKER_00]: the floral culture industry doesn't see
that they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see them as a force in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't see it as something that
should be cultured and built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what I learned is that the
floral culture industry is simply not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a particularly good job to get
flowers into the hands of students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one that I've talked to on the
industry side would tell me they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buy flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not buyers of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, one thing that I figured is I
have this very large group, 300 some
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do some surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, and they're from all
cross-sections of society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, OK, maybe not all cross-sections of
societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are students who are in college,
probably going into a particular array,
[SPEAKER_00]: into a particular lives where they will
have maybe an above-average income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a clientele you want to develop or
not in floral culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, flowers are luxury objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the Floral Endowment was very
interested in seeing data on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've actually funded a project for
me to ask these students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get the money into my hands
literally the day before spring quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: started, last quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last quarter, I wove a bunch of surveys
already into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this spring quarter, starting
basically in two weeks, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the project sort of full blast and hit the
students with targeted questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can ask them about consumer
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we can learn how the flower
industry can unlock this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the surveys, I have actually a very
interesting tool already.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take attendance, the students have
to come with a Scantron form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have Scantron machines
here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, UC Davis maintains a set of
Scantron machines, which are machines that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grade multiple choice testing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The students have to have a Scantron form
to run through the Scantron machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cost like a quarter each or a
dime or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I do use those for attendance
already, the student is already using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have 100 slots where I could ask
questions on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as I can form my question in
the form of a multiple choice or two false
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, I can ask any question I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might think that that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about some questions that in
a typical survey you cannot ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you rich?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you poor?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you ask a question like that in
a conventional survey?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can ask these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to phrase them cleverly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to give the students the choice
to opt out so they don't fill out the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, all these questions that are
not point generating questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: the students know which questions generate
points and which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I make the survey, at the very
beginning of the quarter, I have already
[SPEAKER_00]: told them that this is nationally funded
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of a nationally funded
project to help college students have
[SPEAKER_00]: better access to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have another motivation to answer
the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know that I'm not going to be
saying much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each of the forms has their student ID
number on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week after week, I can link all the
surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the most inclusive and credible
database of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only have to ask the gender question
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have to ask the age question once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my database, I just keep adding
more tables in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can link across these tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because otherwise, if they don't turn
the form in, they don't get their
[SPEAKER_00]: attendance points, they're pretty much
captive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much have to turn the piece of
paper in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they mark is a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have ever done any surveys,
that's half the battle, is getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: form back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the battle is having them actually
look at the thing, make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, we got the vast majority
of people answering the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some consumer preference testing
on pot roses, on orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually an example of how the
survey was being run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had two more stations like this in
other adjacent buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with 300 some students,
to have them walk around a table like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, that could take a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sent them out to lots of different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on this particular day,
when they do this, they also get the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pot of plants end up in their
hands to make flower impact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we got 2 thirds of these
flowers donated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third we grew ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I grew them in my greenhouse
production class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the students had to actually pony
up some cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to make a donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were going to get a pot rose,
they had to make a $2 donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had an orchid, they had to get a
$5 donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they weren't willing to make a
donation, they could take one of the free
[SPEAKER_00]: mums that I had grown, which are pretty
nice looking plants also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the flower arranging,
we do some consumer preference there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the vases donated by somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, we can do a preference
testing on that to see what students
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have 18 different vases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students can show preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different flowers that flower
growers donated to this cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will, of course, first we do the
survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the students can grab flowers and
make arrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tried to analyze the individual
bouquets to see if we could characterize
[SPEAKER_00]: bouquets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't quite finished with doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure that this is really going
to work as yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, each student has a number
in a particular workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see the part of Lindsay's
name there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some other names there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have blotted those out,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the different bouquets are made by the
different participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're photographed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then set out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the students go with their
Scantron form and give us their
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might think that that would be an
obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But students have special kinds of needs
when they're in a dorm room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dorm room, there isn't a lot of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big bouquet is not necessarily the
most preferred thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for some very special
features that will make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the kind of thing we're
trying to tease out here to try to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Student preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company that donated the plants
for this is generally very happy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they've kind of seen what they
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a few survey results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you the whole story
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you maybe two results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this actually represents,
then, the population of my plant science
[SPEAKER_00]: sixth class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, indeed, more women than men.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK, 17% men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in age, we have a fairly young
demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we're going to
slice and dice a little different next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize I had so many in that 18
to 20 category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there were going to be fewer in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of school year,
I have basically the same amount of any
[SPEAKER_00]: class out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wildly appealing at all levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of consumer preference,
this is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular orchid, the students are
given the question, in terms of the five
[SPEAKER_00]: responses they can make, this plant is
awesome, very attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it more attractive than average,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, this plant is not
attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this particular situation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at a different variety,
it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pattern is quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular demographic has a very
particular thing they'd like better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the company that has these orchids
going out, that can make a big difference
[SPEAKER_00]: what they send to Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one question that we asked
regarding access to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please mark all that you consider to be
correct statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students generally do not buy flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something this group would not do
even if they had better access to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to floral products, 18% agreed with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students do buy flowers, but not many due
to various reasons, including access and
[SPEAKER_00]: perceived cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice this doesn't add to 100
because they could actually choose
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple of these as things they agreed
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students would buy significantly more
floral products if they experience
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing similar to what they see for
candy, music, clothes, cosmetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: toys, et cetera, 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the industry, this is very
potent information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who says they're doing it is
simply not understanding that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not targeting this demographic at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could sell many more flowers into
this demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then none of the above are correct
statements about students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see very few people would not pick
one of those as being something they would
[SPEAKER_00]: mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we open a flower shop on campus run by
students, which of the following would be
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely to be profitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I should sell this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, I should sell this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it away in typical university
professor style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, if you want to start a flower
shop at Cornell, here's your business
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oh, and notice the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selling floral products to students would
not be profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people who would actually
buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, by the time this question
was asked, they had learned how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: impact with their flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may have been biased by the course
itself for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I have to do
differently, next year I have to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-survey very early on and then have
them come back and do this again at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end to see how their minds change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have lots of information like
this, and we're going to collect more of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just summarize then with respect
to this flower power course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, flower culture information has
very broad appeal amongst college
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's generally much more than we would
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a big surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I keep teasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the campus at UC Davis is currently
building a 600-seat classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm going to be signing up for
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see where my power runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't run out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very popular course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's that way because I really
aim it at the needs of the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not focused on my needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy for me to do the way I'm doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a boatload of work, particularly
with all those plants flowing through
[SPEAKER_00]: people's hands, all those flowers,
all those floral products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a massive amount of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't have TAs, I couldn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm grateful for the TAs that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the fact that the
students are telling us things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't do a lot of advertising,
but I do some.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finds its way onto little bulletin
boards outside certain faculty members'
[SPEAKER_00]: office doors strategically placed around
the campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plastered it at the dining comments
inside the glass door as they walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students look at it, and it's sort
of a universal appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they realize what it says,
learn to speak the language of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another potent term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did initially think that this course
would channel students into our majors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed, essentially, student FTE,
student credit hours that we were not
[SPEAKER_00]: catching in any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're never going to see again in
another plant science course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got them, and hopefully trained
them how to use flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the financial problems we're having,
many of our lower enrollment courses are
[SPEAKER_00]: being canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students are desperate for
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is filling such a void.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need things they can put into their
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be surprised if that sort of thing
is not happening here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, with that, that's the material I
wanted to present to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm open to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
