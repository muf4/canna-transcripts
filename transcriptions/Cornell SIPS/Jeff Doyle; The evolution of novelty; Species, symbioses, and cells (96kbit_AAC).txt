[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about what I did on my
summer vacation, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually, I mean this in a
sense that in just a few months,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be fully retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, I'll be asking for the
faculty to grant me emeritus status.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to prove that I'm still actually
doing something useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this is all about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk about a major
question, which is how novelty arises.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the fundamental question in
evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to talk about it in several
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is about species and how they arise
and evolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, how structures evolve,
how they originate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thirdly, at the cell level,
how do cell types evolve, all three of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll tell three short stories
essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is about speciation and its
consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in particular, a couple of short
stories about soybean relatives,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I worked on for years, and also
rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, the evolution of
nodulation symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, talking about gene
duplications and the evolution of cell
[SPEAKER_03]: type diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: What these things have in common,
other than novelty, is polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Susheng mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My research has been about polyploidy,
whole genome duplication, for many,
[SPEAKER_03]: many years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So polyploidy, I think, as everybody knows
here, is everything above the level of two
[SPEAKER_03]: sets of chromosomes in a cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a phenomenon that is very common in
nature at the organismal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Endopolyploidy is a common phenomenon,
as it mentions here in this review paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: indispensable for normal development and
organ formation across various organisms,
[SPEAKER_03]: from fungi to humans and plants,
of course, as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adrian Roeder's work on giant cells and
the sepals of Arabidopsis, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the muscle cell with two nuclei.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, it's a very common
phenomenon in cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cancer, as it says here, is an ugly
consequence of endoreplication and
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploidization.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to be talking about
endopolyploidy today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be talking about whole organism
polyploidy, where whole organisms are
[SPEAKER_03]: duplicated, duplicate their genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And polyploidy occurs throughout the
entire tree of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us in this room are multiply
polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with all of the vertebrates based on
a very long time ago polyploidization
[SPEAKER_03]: event, all the way back here in the
Cambrian explosion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other common lab organisms, such as yeast,
are polyploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you like salmon, for example,
and trout, you're eating recent
[SPEAKER_03]: tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plants really do polyploidy in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is from the 1,000 plant
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,000 different transcriptomes of
different species, among which there were
[SPEAKER_03]: 244 whole genome duplication events
identified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some shared, many of them shared,
but also unique ones at the tips of these
[SPEAKER_03]: branches of the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look over here on the side at
the distribution of the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploid events, whole genome duplication
events, and the ancestry of all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: different taxa, what you'll see is that
many of the common angiosperms,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the rosids and the esterids,
for example, so legumes, esters,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of those things, have an average of
about four whole genome duplication events
[SPEAKER_03]: in their evolutionary histories that you
see in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend Jonathan Wendell published a
very nice paper on this some years back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he calls it the wondrous cycles of
polyploidy in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for us enthusiasts about polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think of it as a wonderful sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we see is this cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are a whole bunch of different
polyploidy events across the tree of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have all sorts of events that
happen on concomitance to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, this whole cycle of
duplication and gene loss, balanced biased
[SPEAKER_03]: fractionation or gene loss in different
subgenomes, genome downsizing,
[SPEAKER_03]: so loss of repeated sequence, for example,
rearrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've produced a functionally
diploid plant through this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It involves many different individual
processes that are called lumped together
[SPEAKER_03]: as diploidization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this diploidization cycle followed by
another round of polyploidy gives us the
[SPEAKER_03]: complex genomes that we see in flowering
plants today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first of my vignettes is about
speciation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to talk much about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an area where a lot of my research
has been over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just going to mention a couple of
things that we've been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long-term project to actually look
at the evolution of the soybean relatives
[SPEAKER_03]: that you see down here, perennial soybeans
native to Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jacob Landis has led much of this work in
recent years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so collaboration with Ching Lee,
Liu at Syngenta, and Andrew Farmer at
[SPEAKER_03]: National Center for Genome Resources in
Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This paper, I think Jacob just submitted
it, what, a week and a half ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was one of the main things we
worked on during the summer, was
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding this legacy of polyploidy
and introgression and looking at it across
[SPEAKER_03]: 2,300 different nuclear genes from genome
resequencing done by Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_03]: A second project that was working on quite
a bit this summer was mainly led by
[SPEAKER_03]: Zhenwei Zhu here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zhenwei and her mentor Song Ge at the
Botanical Institute in Beijing have been
[SPEAKER_03]: working on rice aloe polyploids for many
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this particular project was a genome
project in which looking at this rice that
[SPEAKER_03]: you see here, this Arisa minuta,
48 chromosomes derived from these two
[SPEAKER_03]: diploid species here, formed around
700,000 years ago, traced the genomes
[SPEAKER_03]: using phylogenetic methods and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here you'll see the circus diagram
showing the subgenomes of the polyploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're virtually identical in terms
of synteny and their organization with the
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes of the diploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when you dig a little bit deeper,
you'll find that the diploidization
[SPEAKER_03]: process has started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this paper is about how different
parts of that diploidization are either
[SPEAKER_03]: episodic, some of them occurring right
away after polyploid formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And others are more gradual.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the acquisition of
transposable elements has been a gradual
[SPEAKER_03]: process as opposed to gene loss,
which has been much more episodic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a project that I'm not going to
say much more about just to let you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the questions is, why is
polyploidy so common across plants
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea is that polyploidy is a
generator of novelty at pretty much every
[SPEAKER_03]: possible level.
[SPEAKER_03]: This classic paper by Don Levin,
someone Bill knows very well, he's smiling
[SPEAKER_03]: here in the front, is a real classic in
terms of all the ways that polyploidy can
[SPEAKER_03]: create evolutionary novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: A paper by Mike Frilling a little bit
later, gene balance duplications are a
[SPEAKER_03]: drive to increase morphological
complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been a recurring theme in the
polyploidy literature all along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Cote, who was a student here many
years ago and has been one of my top
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborators for years now, and I wrote
this paper on a little essay really on
[SPEAKER_03]: autopolyploidy as an epigenetic
macromutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a macromutation is a single event,
polyploidy in this case, with many
[SPEAKER_03]: different phenotypic consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it qualifies there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And epigenetics are molecules and
mechanisms that can perpetuate alternative
[SPEAKER_03]: gene activity states in the context of the
same DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of many definitions of
epigenetics, but it's one that suits my
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes, so I grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if you make a synthetic
polyploid, just double the chromosome
[SPEAKER_03]: number using colchicine, you have a plant
that's isogenic with its diploid
[SPEAKER_03]: progenitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has the same DNA sequences,
but it also has many phenotypic
[SPEAKER_03]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you do that, that's the
macromutation, and the same DNA sequence
[SPEAKER_03]: is the epigenetic part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an autopolyploid is an epigenetic
macromutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the source of all of that
novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the genome doubling part,
I mentioned also allopolyploids,
[SPEAKER_03]: the rice for example, and allopolyploids
add another component, which is hybridity,
[SPEAKER_03]: heterosis, those kinds of effects as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But pure polyploidy, as you might call,
it has been called autopolyploidy,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a matter of just doubling the same
genome, and so it by itself can create
[SPEAKER_03]: evolutionary novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy and I explored this at the cell
level, trying to get caught up to cell
[SPEAKER_03]: biology, modern cell biology, and wrote
this paper, and all these lines and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything show you we're talking about
two different phenomena, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Increased dosage when you double the
genome, of course, and also increased bulk
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that's rather
controversial, something called the
[SPEAKER_03]: nucleotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are familiar with genotype and
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people are familiar with the
nucleotype, which is just correlations
[SPEAKER_03]: with various different characteristics of
the plant or animal, such as cell size,
[SPEAKER_03]: nuclear volume, things like that,
that follow from increasing the DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not clear yet at this point whether
or not this is causality or correlation
[SPEAKER_03]: only, but it's an intriguing thing that
you see this trend across many different
[SPEAKER_03]: traits where allopolyploids or just plants
with larger DNA contents even show these
[SPEAKER_03]: trends of having larger cell size,
nuclear volume, and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is thought in many ways to be the
source of all the other phenomena that
[SPEAKER_03]: follow from that, all these different
lines that I'm showing here, complex
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key point of this for this talk is
just that this also does lead to
[SPEAKER_03]: morphological changes, physiological
changes, and even ecological changes as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That brings me to my next section of this
talk, and that's the origin of nodulation
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nodulation is a symbiotic association
between some flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: a limited number of them, and diverse soil
bacteria, and the bacteria are housed in
[SPEAKER_03]: these nodules, which you can see here,
which then fix atmospheric nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_03]: form ammonia, so fertilizer for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nodule is a morphologically and
anatomically and biochemically complex
[SPEAKER_03]: evolutionary novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not found in other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Its most associated nodulation is with the
legume family, but it's neither confined
[SPEAKER_03]: to the legume family, nor is it universal
within the legume families.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question that's been asked for many years
is what is the nodule exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can look at it and see what it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the roots, usually the roots,
sometimes the shoots of a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anne Hirsch at UCLA and Tom LaRue used to
be up the road here at Boyce Thompson
[SPEAKER_03]: Institute years back, asked is it a
modified root, a modified stem,
[SPEAKER_03]: or a completely novel organ, an organ sui
generis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Early ideas about nodule origins included
a horizontal transfer of different
[SPEAKER_03]: components, such as leghemoglobin,
and those of you who eat impossible
[SPEAKER_03]: burgers may be familiar with leghemoglobin
as the red color that you're seeing there,
[SPEAKER_03]: the substitute for myoglobin and
hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I can say more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just gave this talk for Mark Soros in
the background there, the polyploidy talk
[SPEAKER_03]: yesterday for your class, Mark,
and one of the students pointed out that
[SPEAKER_03]: when you look at the impossible burger,
what is that stuff there in a real burger?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it blood when you get the red stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a big debate about whether
it was actually blood or not, and it turns
[SPEAKER_03]: out someone looked it up and it's
myoglobin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not blood that gives you the juice of
a hamburger, apparently, but I didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: On this burger, it's leghemoglobin,
so it's a vegetarian item.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, to get back to the talk,
the evolution of root endosymbiosis
[SPEAKER_03]: involves this nodule structure,
and Martin Parnisky and Katharina Markman
[SPEAKER_03]: asked this question, how novel really are
nodules?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this gets back to the original
question about what it is, what is a
[SPEAKER_03]: nodule?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it turns out that most everything that
is happening in nodulation is a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: recruiting a preexisting function or
structure from some other program already
[SPEAKER_03]: present in the plant, and so my colleague
Makoto Hayashi and Takashi Soyano asked
[SPEAKER_03]: this question and reviewed this some years
back now, and so basically what nodulation
[SPEAKER_03]: has done is recruit gene regulatory
modules from our muscular mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiosis, from lateral root development,
from nitrate responses, and maybe from
[SPEAKER_03]: other places as well, from the whole
infection process.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all sorts of things, but almost
nothing about nodulation is itself novel,
[SPEAKER_03]: the genes or anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here at the heart of it all is
something called NIN, and this recent
[SPEAKER_03]: review paper, NIN is a transcription
factor called nodule inception,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so if you look at what happens during
nodulation, you have the rhizobia being
[SPEAKER_03]: signaled by the plant and exchanging
signals, infecting, starting an infection
[SPEAKER_03]: thread, infection thread growth,
proceeding into the cortex, initiating
[SPEAKER_03]: nodule formation, and eventually forming a
complete nodule with this outgrowth from
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant, and eventually then becoming
functional involving in nitrate responses
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every one of these steps is controlled
by NIN, and so basically NIN, first of
[SPEAKER_03]: all, had to acquire some sort of binding
sites for key elements of the signaling
[SPEAKER_03]: process we recruited from mycorrhizal
symbiosis, including the cycloidia binding
[SPEAKER_03]: site, which you see down here,
and then the other thing that had to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen was that NIN targets must have
acquired NIN binding sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are about 145 direct interactors
of NIN, at least that's one estimate,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe an overestimate, but still a lot of
different genes have had to come directly
[SPEAKER_03]: under the influence, the control of NIN,
so all of those had to acquire binding
[SPEAKER_03]: sites from NIN, and so one of the
questions, a big evolutionary question is
[SPEAKER_03]: how, in the evolution of novelty,
is how do these kinds of binding sites,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they're truly novel, how do they
evolve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they're not truly novel,
how do they get brought under the control
[SPEAKER_03]: of the novel transcription factor system?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a major question, we'll return
to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't told you about polyploidy
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The polyploidy angle here is that people
have speculated for many years that
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploidy within the legions,
which had been known to include polyploidy
[SPEAKER_03]: exist to occur, had been implicated in the
evolution of nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the Medicago genome paper,
2011, and when the Medicago genome was
[SPEAKER_03]: sequenced, it was found, not surprisingly
because of previous work, that the genome
[SPEAKER_03]: was structured showing evidence of a whole
genome duplication and shared with other
[SPEAKER_03]: legions as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when soybean was then was sequenced,
it showed it had that whole genome
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at this, people speculated,
well, okay, so this, you've got a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: genome duplication at the base of this
whole group of legions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that whole genome duplications can
spur novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nodulation also seemed to be unique to
legions, or at least probably evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: there as one of its sources of evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the speculation was, well,
okay, so this is what's happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had polyploidy either causing
nodulation to occur or doing something to
[SPEAKER_03]: modify it if it already existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about the same time, this paper from
Rene Geertz and his group, a whole genome
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication has occurred at the root of
the legume, papillonoidae.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the bean-like subfamilies of
soybean and lupin and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hypothesize that gene pairs originating
from this duplication event have evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiotic functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple of years later,
another paper came out talking about it
[SPEAKER_03]: may have led to enhanced root nodule
symbiosis in the papillonoidae,
[SPEAKER_03]: the bean-like legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a paper from some other colleagues
of mine that came out just recently
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at flavonoid synthesis and
biosynthesis genes in the legume family
[SPEAKER_03]: and showing, again, there's some novel
genes found only in the legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of these are due to gene genomes or
gene duplications and that are unique to
[SPEAKER_03]: the legume family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this supports the idea that whole
genome duplication has led to increasing
[SPEAKER_03]: the repertoire of genes available for
nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mentioned already that it's not
necessarily found only in the legume.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in fact, nodulation is phylogenetically
scattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until 2018, which I'll explain in a
moment, this was explained by a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of convergence and loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it turns out that nodulation,
once thought to be widely scattered in the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering plants, early on in the era of
phylogenetics was shown to be concentrated
[SPEAKER_03]: in one clade within the flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is called the nitrogen fixing
clade or nodulation fixing clade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within this clade, though,
you'll see that it's scattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the light blue or dark blue here that
you see, dark blue means that entire group
[SPEAKER_03]: has nodulation symbioses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light blue means that it's scattered
within that group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in legumes, for example, the green is
rhizobial symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These other ones are actinorhizal
symbiotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different group of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the legumes, you can see,
again, dark green means that that entire
[SPEAKER_03]: group, every one of those plants will
nodulate with one or two exceptions where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in other groups, you'll see light
green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that it's scattered within
those groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have this distribution where
everything is concentrated in one clade.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then within that entire group,
you have origins or losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very complex pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, nodulation is phylogenetically
scattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of it was explained as a
combination of convergent gains and then
[SPEAKER_03]: independent losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was always how many of each?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were pretty confident that there
were multiple origins, but we didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: how many and how many times it had been
lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do we care about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I care because I'm an evolutionary
biologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is certainly an interesting
question, curiosity-driven research
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the bigger picture for people who are
interested in applied sorts of things is
[SPEAKER_03]: that generating fertilizer for agriculture
is a very expensive, ecologically
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive as well as monetarily expensive
proposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so wouldn't it be nice if we could
engineer grasses for example, crop plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that don't do this symbiotic nitrogen
fixation to have these kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships, make nodules, make their own
fertilizer essentially?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're thinking about that,
you might ask the question, how easy is
[SPEAKER_03]: that going to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's in evolution, it happened
multiple different times, that would be an
[SPEAKER_03]: easier proposition perhaps than if it had
only happened one time ever in all the
[SPEAKER_03]: history of flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, even if it's happened multiple
times, it's happened only in that one
[SPEAKER_03]: clade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something is unique about that clade
that we have to figure out if we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to make grasses do this kind of thing as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that predisposition, people called it,
has been really elusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody has figured out what it is that
makes that clade different from everything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of a holy grail kind of thing
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chasing unicorns, why do I say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because everybody kept talking about
this, but it was very hard to figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: how you would actually test these
different hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so testing whether or not nodules
across different nodulating species are
[SPEAKER_03]: homologous.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, they have the same origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come from a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you tell that apart from a
convergent gain?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things we thought about,
this was following other works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not unique to me, my application to
the legumes or to nodulation was maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: unique, but the idea was out there in
other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might the genomes of non-nodulating taxa
harbor fossil evidence that they once
[SPEAKER_03]: nodulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would help us to distinguish
between primary absence of nodulation and
[SPEAKER_03]: secondary loss and focusing on
non-nodulating species instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: nodulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of asking whether nodules are
homologous, we could ask for evidence that
[SPEAKER_03]: some plants that no longer show nodulation
had actually once been able to nodulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2018, it was a seminal year for
this, two different groups came up with
[SPEAKER_03]: tests of this, and both of them came to
the same conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this first paper discovered signatures
of multiple independent loss of function
[SPEAKER_03]: events in the indispensable symbiotic
regulator nodule inception, NIN,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a number of different holy sequence
genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this paper, taken together results
challenge the view that nodulation evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: in parallel, raises the possibility that
nodulation originated approximately 100
[SPEAKER_03]: million years ago in a common ancestor of
all nodulating plant species and then was
[SPEAKER_03]: subsequently lost in other groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was great, and NIN was almost the
only gene lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of other good
candidates that sort of are lost here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there, but basically NIN is the one thing
that's really unique about nodulation in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did this look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's a phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the single origin of nodulation,
the stars or losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is, I think I've got an arrow for
NIN showing here this is a presence or
[SPEAKER_03]: absence of NIN.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look down this column and
compare it with nodulating and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-nodulating species, you'll see that
there's a very good correlation between
[SPEAKER_03]: the presence of NIN and nodulation or the
absence of NIN and non-nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here's, again, what things look
like in the genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got in legumes, Vigna, Phasiollus,
Soybean, Pigeon Pea, Chick Pea,
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that have all got a functional
copy of NIN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nesolia, shown here, is a legume that has
clearly lost the ability to nodulate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is lacking NIN entirely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a good correlation between a known loss
and the absence of NIN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is a plant that's in the papillonoid
family, but near the base, and it might or
[SPEAKER_03]: might not have lost it secondarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, but the data here suggests
NIN has just gone completely, so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably a loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And up here is the redbud tree,
which, those of you may not know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a legume.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the bean family, but it's one of
the first offshoots that its subfamily is
[SPEAKER_03]: sister to the rest of the legume family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Circis, the redbud, NIN is present,
but it's a pseudogene, so it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: inactivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, again, it's not always lost,
but inactivation also shows you that this
[SPEAKER_03]: critical gene involved in nodulation is
present in a non-nodulating species,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it is just non-functional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we followed up, Shufen Chang is a good
colleague of mine, a friend, and he has
[SPEAKER_03]: been also looking into this further,
more genome sequenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see the same pattern whenever that
happens, any strong correlation between
[SPEAKER_03]: absence of NIN and lack of nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Robin Van Velsen and Rene Geertz led
this little essay-type thing in trends in
[SPEAKER_03]: plant science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is, again, the pattern that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these black things here, black clades,
are places where nodulation does not
[SPEAKER_03]: occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, again, we're seeing a single origin
of nodulation followed by massive parallel
[SPEAKER_03]: losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the weakest link in any argument about
having a single origin was always it took
[SPEAKER_03]: so many independent losses to account for
this that it was never going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: parsimonious argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as parsimony was your
criterion for judging things, this just
[SPEAKER_03]: was never palatable at all as an ongoing
argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does this new hypothesis deal with
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is, so you're asking what
could cause so many independent losses,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has to do with atmospheric CO2
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what has happened is that global
atmosphere and atmospheric CO2 levels have
[SPEAKER_03]: generally been decreasing in the last 100
million years since the time when
[SPEAKER_03]: nodulation is hypothesized to have risen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, consequently, because nodulation
really requires a lot of carbon in the
[SPEAKER_03]: form of making the nodule but also giving
photosynthate to the bacteria in exchange
[SPEAKER_03]: for the nitrogen they produce,
when you have a situation in which CO2
[SPEAKER_03]: levels are decreasing, carbon becomes
increasingly expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cost-benefit ratio between
nodulation, nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the expense of the carbon changes and
shifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start out with a carbon to nitrogen
cost-benefit ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's positive at the beginning of this
whole era, but it declines as CO2 levels
[SPEAKER_03]: decline in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes more and more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what the hypothesis says is that as
that happens, different genotypes,
[SPEAKER_03]: different species, and remember this is a
genotype of the plants by genotype of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria by environment kind of
proposition, G by G by E.
[SPEAKER_03]: As that happens, carbon becomes too
expensive and nodulation ceases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plants just shut it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So absence of nodulation is not lost,
at least not initially, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So nodulation is plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, actually, if you look today,
if you look at field legume crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you fertilize that field, the legumes
don't bother to make nodules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get free nitrogen from the
fertilizer, so they don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a plastic response.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you keep turning, if you keep
everything turned off after you've ceased
[SPEAKER_03]: to do nodulation, however, everything
starts to decay as you remove the genes
[SPEAKER_03]: from selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so purifying selection is relaxed,
and you'll start to accumulate mutations
[SPEAKER_03]: in these key genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why Circis, for example,
the redbud, still has NIN, but it's NIN
[SPEAKER_03]: has decayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't function anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other plants have lost NIN completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what happens also with cave
animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cave animals, when they go into the
darkness, the eye becomes dispensable,
[SPEAKER_03]: and usually mutations occur pretty quickly
to eliminate the eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there even are scenarios that are
suggested, somewhat controversially,
[SPEAKER_03]: that involve positive selection,
because even the machinery that's involved
[SPEAKER_03]: in making eyes, even if you're not using
them, is also expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there may be some selection
pressure to actually get rid of the eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: entirely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this single-origin massive parallel
loss hypothesis became very popular in the
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in those two papers that I cited
before, that's like 90% of the top players
[SPEAKER_03]: in the nodulation community were involved
in one of those two papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people really are pretty invested in
this hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, as I say here, this paper came
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's been in bioarchives for a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took it a long time to get through,
but finally published just a few weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in this paper, what they did was
they made a phylogeny of 12,000 different
[SPEAKER_03]: species of nodulating and non-nodulating
plants in this whole clade, primarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, much of it from herbarium material,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a shout-out to the herbarium,
because you can use herbarium material to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually isolate DNA and use that in a
study like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They updated the nodulation database of
which species nodulate and which ones
[SPEAKER_03]: don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then used hidden Markov models to
test the fit of different evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: transition rate models and reconstructed
ancestral character states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is state-of-the-art phylogenomics,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what people do with big
phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They test hypotheses like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they looked at root nodulation
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their results showed that the best
models were 16 independent gains and 10
[SPEAKER_03]: subsequent losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've gone back to now the
state-of-the-art hypothesis on a phylogeny
[SPEAKER_03]: is now saying 16 origins, the one that
everybody in the nodulation community
[SPEAKER_03]: likes, is one origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the truth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, truth and science, that's two words
that you don't want to necessarily put
[SPEAKER_03]: together all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, how do you test the
homologies?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back to that question, back to where
we were before 2018, saying, OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe there were multiple origins,
but how do we test that now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can you test homology if
recruitment was convergent?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's called deep homology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't mention that when I mentioned
the recruitment process in nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those things that are shared across
non-homologous origins are themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: homologous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lateral root development using
scarecrow and short root, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something that's common to all
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that module is going to be homologous
no matter how many different times it was
[SPEAKER_03]: recruited in different origins of
nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at that is never going to help
us answer that question, not just the
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of that, the use of that
particular module, developmental module.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if all the components are
homologous?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you test this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So because what we really want to do is
the uniqueness of the assembly that is
[SPEAKER_03]: what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can we figure out whether the same
thing was built a couple of different
[SPEAKER_03]: times?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question we're getting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to NIN again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's NIN, our friend, our NIN binding
sites homologous across putative origins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that NIN had to be recruited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The targets of NIN had to recruit this
binding site.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these different genes that you see
here had to independently, in that model,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a 16 origins model, 16 different times,
all of those genes had to recruit NIN's
[SPEAKER_03]: function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we tell that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, can fossil NIN binding sites be
detected in non-nodulators?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a paper we're writing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of not a rebuttal to that new
paper, but really just exploring how we
[SPEAKER_03]: can actually test these hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_03]: People involved in writing that paper,
by the way, are the best man at my wedding
[SPEAKER_03]: and my academic grandson is the main
author.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm not angry with these people or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get to the bottom of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So NIN binding sites is positional
criteria for homology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine a gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a gene, gene X in an ancestor,
XA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a couple of different binding sites
for different transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now NIN comes along, and this gene becomes
recruited as part of the nodulation
[SPEAKER_03]: process that binds NIN.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you have a NIN binding site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've conveniently put it between these
other two sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nodulating species one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suppose we sequence another nodulator from
a different group of plants and we find
[SPEAKER_03]: the same position.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be consistent with homology of
that site.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same sequence, 8 to 15 base pair,
more or less binding site, and it's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same position.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we sequence some other different
genomes from other plants and we find that
[SPEAKER_03]: these NIN binding sites, even if they are
the same site, because that's what NIN
[SPEAKER_03]: binds, across different groups,
if they're in different places,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be consistent with
non-homology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot to go on here,
but this is about the best I think we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we certainly know the NIN binding
sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: This paper just came out a couple of,
I guess a month ago or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw it a month or so ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, there are NIN binding sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these interesting sites here are
found across both nodulating and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-nodulating non-legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the context yet, but that's
something we can look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so philosophical questions continue
to be raised about the nature of homology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you who are evolutionary
biologists, have been hearing the word
[SPEAKER_03]: homology forever since you first started
reading about anything about evolutionary
[SPEAKER_03]: biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a major controversial topic,
how to define homology and what it means
[SPEAKER_03]: and how to test it and everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Günter Wagner, who's an author on this
paper, has been writing books about this
[SPEAKER_03]: for many different years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's character identity mechanisms
are something that this group of authors
[SPEAKER_03]: has come up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't explain them to you because
it's more philosophy than it is biology
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's something that integrate
information, come to this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: hourglass structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the mechanism sits and then
has different readouts from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best example I can give you is
actually for the origin of cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is another paper, this paper from
2016, Günter Wagner was the last author on
[SPEAKER_03]: this paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea being that there's this
integration mechanism here, the core
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory complex that takes all the
inputs, synthesizes that and reads it out
[SPEAKER_03]: to coordinate the efforts of all the
different transcription factors involved
[SPEAKER_03]: in this regulatory complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that combination, combinatorial
factors and factoring of transcription
[SPEAKER_03]: factors and their outputs is what makes a
cell type specific to itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the defining feature of a cell type.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I should say it that way is
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that's the classic example
of one of these character integration
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanisms at the level of the cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they talk about in this paper,
things at hierarchical levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, being analogous to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do I mention that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, here's Giles Oldroyd's paper
again, this is one you saw already.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they summarizes this very nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than novel emergence of new genes,
the evolution of nodulation appears to
[SPEAKER_03]: have involved the re-networking of
pre-existing processes principally
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled by the master regulator NIN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Told you all of that already.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes on to say, they go on to say,
we need to understand not only how this
[SPEAKER_03]: happens, but also how it's able to
activate such diverse development in the
[SPEAKER_03]: different cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're back to cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only do we need to know about cell
types philosophically, but we need to know
[SPEAKER_03]: about them practically speaking to
actually get to the bottom of this
[SPEAKER_03]: mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brings me to my last thing yet,
which is gene duplications and the origin
[SPEAKER_03]: of cell type diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeremy and I have been interested in
cell types for a little while,
[SPEAKER_03]: mainly because it turns out that the
effect of polyploidy varies with cell
[SPEAKER_03]: type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some cell types respond by becoming
much larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other cell types, on the other hand,
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so being as cell size is one of the
key factors involved, we think,
[SPEAKER_03]: in pretty much everything downstream of
polyploidization and creating novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an important thing to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we ask the question, well,
first of all, what's a cell type?
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't know, don't agree on what a
cell type is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is 2022, 2023.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hong Kuei Zhang is the head of the Allen
Brain Institute, where they work on
[SPEAKER_03]: neurons and neuron cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are hundreds, if not thousands,
of cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: These authors are tops in their field.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a cell type?
[SPEAKER_03]: This paper was just from a week and a half
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a little review paper,
a little popular piece in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was actually interviewed for this
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still a question of what this
actually means.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a cell type?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, I was interviewed because
I've written a little bit about it because
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to figure out what in the
world a cell type was and how to deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Likened it to species, which is a very bad
thing to do because species, nobody agrees
[SPEAKER_03]: on what a species is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And worked with Mark Lebow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see him in a second again to just
talk about this in a recent paper last
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark is one of the leaders in the field of
single cell biology in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm fortunate to be a colleague of his
on a grant that we have together,
[SPEAKER_03]: along with Jeremy and Andrew Farmer,
whose name you saw in relation to glycine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a talk that we gave this summer,
actually presented at our botany meetings
[SPEAKER_03]: in Michigan, Single Cell Perspective on
Duplicate Gene Expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this work is asking, this is ongoing
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't published anything yet on this,
soybean at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: To what extent does cell type and cell
state diversity provide niches for
[SPEAKER_03]: duplicated genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So duplication of genes is really
frequent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at this, this is a classic
paper here, Lynch and Connery 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking here the number of pairs,
percentage of pairs of duplicated genes as
[SPEAKER_03]: a function of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is KS down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a epoxy for time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see this kind of L-shaped pattern
in all different taxa.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this is, these are small-scale
duplications, so single genes or a few
[SPEAKER_03]: genes at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this is showing is that
duplication is frequent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have lots of pairs at time t equals
zero, essentially, and not much else
[SPEAKER_03]: beyond that, meaning that these things are
duplicating, turning over copy number
[SPEAKER_03]: variation in gene copy number,
and then loss almost immediately,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Arabidopsis looks a little bit
different, and that's because this peak
[SPEAKER_03]: down here is a whole genome duplication
that Arabidopsis, the most recent of the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole genome duplications that Arabidopsis
has experienced.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the same idea occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a whole genome duplication
followed by lots of losses and booms in
[SPEAKER_03]: that diploidization process I mentioned at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to account for why gene pairs
get kept ever, because most of the time
[SPEAKER_03]: you think about it, these are redundant
genes at the time of their formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant was perfectly happy with just
one copy before, and now we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain why do some get kept and other
ones don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably heard of
neofunctionalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is partitioning expression by
function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a gene that had a single function,
this duplicate copies have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: function initially, but then one of them
acquires a novel function, and that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once these genes are partitioned by
function, there's reason to keep both
[SPEAKER_03]: copies essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's partitioning by function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subfunctionalization is also involving
function, but usually we think of it as
[SPEAKER_03]: being partitioning of expression involving
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this model, a gene has multiple
functions, and then these are partitioned
[SPEAKER_03]: such that one gene is doing some of the
functions, some doing the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: This diagram is not as good, I think,
as this one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think of something that a
single copy gene was expressed in limb and
[SPEAKER_03]: brain, and then after duplication,
one of the copies loses the ability to be
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other loses its ability to be
expressed in the limb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have an indispensable two copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need one of each of those copies,
and they're maintained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is involving location of the
expression as much as anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at expression of location at
the single-cell level, we have bulk
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue, cell types, cell states of a
single type, and then single cells within
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a gene duplication, A and B,
copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can ask about expression whether one or
both or neither are expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we look at the bulk tissue,
the root might be expressing one copy
[SPEAKER_03]: predominantly, the leaf, the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we now look at the root expression at
the cell type level, we see the same kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of pattern where some cell types or cell
clusters are expressing some, cell types
[SPEAKER_03]: are expressing one gene, some the other,
some both, some neither.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we break out the epidermis cells,
for example, and look at these as they
[SPEAKER_03]: develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Becoming mature, again, the same kind of
pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even at the single-cell level,
we may see variation in terms of which
[SPEAKER_03]: gene is being expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This level of the single-cell is probably
beyond, for various reasons, beyond our
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to really work with very clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're really talking about cell
clusters, a mixture of state and type.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of years ago, we looked at
expression and partitioning of duplicate
[SPEAKER_03]: genes in Arabidopsis, 11,000 different
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Duplicate gene pairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, we classified them, as you can
see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If neither gene was expressed in any of
the cell clusters, it was a class zero,
[SPEAKER_03]: one, only one copy expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we see here in copy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: In class one, both copies expressed,
but always, both were present.
[SPEAKER_03]: No fixation in any of the cell types.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this class three, we have both copies
expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cell types, only one was
expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other cell types, both were expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here, we have a case of what
really looks like sub-functionalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have partitioning of expression in
different cell types or cell clusters
[SPEAKER_03]: between the two gene copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what this looks like,
one of the sub-functionalization cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your two genes that are derived from the
whole genome duplication in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see here that one of them is
expressed here, and this is endodermis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And down here, the other copy is not
expressed there, but it's instead
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed in a couple of different places
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this partitioning has happened,
presumably following gene duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now looking at soybean in this
project at 10 different organs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can read the details over here,
120,000 single nucleus sequencing,
[SPEAKER_03]: 187 cell clusters, a lot of annotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a project involving Mark Lebow and
some of my other colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at 60,000 duplicated gene pairs by
the type of duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the numbers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing I want to show is that this
involves also two whole genome
[SPEAKER_03]: duplications.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that I've mentioned before is found in
all the bean-like legumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is a much more recent
duplication, only within the last,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, 10 million years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one is in soybean only.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is about 60 million years
old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we look at the evolution of
expression patterns following duplication,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do we expect to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a single copy gene expressed in a
number of different cell clusters or
[SPEAKER_03]: number of different genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make a simplifying, a very simplifying
assumption that everybody makes,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that immediately following
duplication, duplicate copies are
[SPEAKER_03]: identical in their expression patterns and
their functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some logic to that,
but it's a pretty tricky one to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody has to do it for
evolutionary purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not much else you can do because
we don't have access usually to the
[SPEAKER_03]: progenitor species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So following duplication, you have two
copies where you had one before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you follow that assumption,
they are all doing the same thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which means they're going to be class two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this is showing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's at time t equals zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you let this go further, 10 million
years or so later, you now have some of
[SPEAKER_03]: them still maintaining this class two,
but other ones have evolved to different
[SPEAKER_03]: classes depending on which genes are being
expressed and which tissues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are silenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are retained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some might be lost entirely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we have for a prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the expectation is that over time,
we should see a depletion of this class
[SPEAKER_03]: two type of gene where both are being
expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do we actually see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some data.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, class zero is the one that's
not expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pairs are not expressed at all
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in every organ, most gene pairs have at
least one copy expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the genes, the largest single
fraction are these class two genes,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20,000 to 30,000 pairs where both genes
are expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have only one duplicate copy expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: By loss or gain have been 7,000 to 12,000
pairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fixation of one copy, and it's always
the same copy in this case, is 7,000 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 15,000 pairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that little tiny bit up above
here, expression partitioning within
[SPEAKER_03]: organs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what that looks like,
a few hundred genes at the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just call your attention to the
nodule because I'm going to loop back a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit to nodulation here at the end
of this talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, there's differentiation in
the location of expression for about 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: of gene pairs after their duplications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to look at this time course,
we can compare the old duplicate,
[SPEAKER_03]: the old whole genome duplication,
60 million years, with the 10 million year
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our expression is that there is a
depletion of class two genes over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do we see?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is exactly what we see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look, there's much more of this
class two gene in the recent duplication
[SPEAKER_03]: than in the old duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see this also in terms of the
expression of the sub-functionalization as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, this class four.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, my last thing here is to talk
about co-expression networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is function now, and gene regulatory
networks are involved in function.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And gene co-expression networks are
proxies for gene regulatory networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point that's being made here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chandler, who's a postdoc with Jeremy
Cote, looked at this, reconstructed GCNs
[SPEAKER_03]: for all these genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some data, 400, 800 modules per
organ, 40 to 100 genes on average per
[SPEAKER_03]: module.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question here is how often do both
members of a pair belong to the same
[SPEAKER_03]: module, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're saying here is, and this is
from the Arabidopsis Interactome paper
[SPEAKER_03]: some years back, initially, following
duplication, all the interactions of a
[SPEAKER_03]: gene that was single copy are maintained
by both copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is the idea, kind of what I
mentioned before, or location of function.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over time, we have interaction
rewiring, and these two genes can now
[SPEAKER_03]: belong to different networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we found was that 80 to 90 percent
of duplicate genes in this data set belong
[SPEAKER_03]: to different modules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a massive amount of rewiring has gone
on across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So extensive functional differentiation of
duplicate copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking at this, thinking of this as a
time course, we have the module in which
[SPEAKER_03]: one homeolog, one of the two duplicated
copies exists, and the module in which the
[SPEAKER_03]: second copy exists, initially,
we should see them belonging to the same
[SPEAKER_03]: modules, and all the genes would be
shared.
[SPEAKER_03]: No change at all following duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time, we should see migration
away from this nice diagonal into the
[SPEAKER_03]: other parts of this module space that we
see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we actually see is pretty much that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Note the much stronger diagonal,
still not great, but stronger certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: than this here in the recent duplication
versus the old duplication.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're seeing that process of migration
away from being in the same modules over
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what these modules look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both duplicates in the same module.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the nodule modules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's nodule module 108, which is
just the opposite, where only one
[SPEAKER_03]: duplicate is present in the module for
most of the genes.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to come back to this, the nodule is a
novel organ, as we said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might think that a novel organ
would provide more niches for expression
[SPEAKER_03]: subfunctionalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, that's more or less what we
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at this, look at the
comparison of the whole genome
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication, two whole genome
duplications, the nodule is always on the
[SPEAKER_03]: high end, at the highest one in terms of
the number of subfunctionalized cases of
[SPEAKER_03]: gene pairs that we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nodules do not appear to differ in the
amount of partitioning that we get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty much like everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at cell type specific
modules in these GCNs, if you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else, all the other organs look
fairly similar here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the cell type specific modules
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nodule is very different in terms of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why might that be?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because the cell clusters that are
showing the most of that sort of effect
[SPEAKER_03]: are actually novel cell types,
infected cell types within the nodule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I've shown you for this last part
is cell types and states within organs
[SPEAKER_03]: provide apparently inexhaustible niches
for refinement of duplicate gene
[SPEAKER_03]: expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Single cell resolution allows us to track
evolution of cell type specific expression
[SPEAKER_03]: over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nodule, which is a relatively
young organ, provides insights into the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution of novelty and the role played
by duplication and fueling innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are my three vignettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Polyploidy generates diversity through
speciation and genome evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have been involved in the origin or
refinement of nodulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these wondrous cycles of
polyploidy can be observed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: occupancy of expression niches at the
single cell level by duplicated genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a question about essentially like
synthetic biology with this NIN group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So has there been any attempts,
to your knowledge, of taking those groups
[SPEAKER_02]: that, because they would be closer,
like the ones that do have the motifs for
[SPEAKER_02]: the NIN binding, but their NIN gene or set
of genes is deactivated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has there been any attempt to sort of
re-activate that and see if they make
[SPEAKER_02]: nodules?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or conversely, or I guess like in
addition, been any more difficult aspect
[SPEAKER_02]: of like engineering this NIN plus motifs
into?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's a lot of questions there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody has reactivated a non-nodulating
species by putting a functional copy of
[SPEAKER_03]: NIN in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing that Rene Geertz has probably
tried that.
[SPEAKER_03]: With trima, this perisponia group is
actually in the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird plant that grows in New
Caledonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, it has close relative trima
that doesn't nodulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're really closely related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either it's a very recent gain of
nodulation or a recent loss of nodulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on which way you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a wonderful system for
trying that experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe Rene hasn't done it,
but it's not reported anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see, other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using NIN in other ways, people have
actually shown that you can take the NIN
[SPEAKER_03]: from one nodulating species and go all the
way to some other clade, completely put it
[SPEAKER_03]: in, and it'll compensate for mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: In lotus japonicus, for example,
you're actually putting in from this
[SPEAKER_03]: perisponia, that cannabatious thing,
and put it into a mutant of lotus
[SPEAKER_03]: japonicus and get it to function in
nodulation again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are really interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_03]: As for looking at the binding sites
themselves, people have done DAP-seq and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that, trying to find where the
sites are and what's interacting and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the noise level in these things,
Makoto Hayashi, I've talked to him about
[SPEAKER_03]: it, and he said they've done the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got thousands of hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he thinks that even the 145 direct
interactors with NIN is probably an
[SPEAKER_03]: overestimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said other people are looking into
this to really refine that more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty complicated, but certainly
people are interested in doing that kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Randy, I think you had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen an economic analysis of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of information around that,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, that someone did a
really neat experiment of trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: replicate carbon atmosphere from several
million years ago, and showed that
[SPEAKER_03]: nodulators would have had a much bigger
advantage then than now, than in more
[SPEAKER_03]: recent carbon atmospheres.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's economics, but of a different
kind than you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what people are looking at now
with engineering, Giles Oldroyd,
[SPEAKER_03]: who I mentioned a couple of times here,
he and others have been thinking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are the components of nodulation,
short of making a nodule, could you get
[SPEAKER_03]: into grasses and actually have that be a
little more realistic to try to do that
[SPEAKER_03]: than get a whole nodule on the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some neat things that people
are finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jean-Michel Hannais, Wisconsin,
he's not the one who found it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: A land race of maize in the mountains of
Mexico that accumulates biofilms of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen-fixing bacteria on the roots,
and actually derives a serious benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another thing, another angle
people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, Randy, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an answer for the dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, OK.
I'll just take the dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take the dollars and run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garav.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so regarding the last result about
nucleic acid diversification, so we also
[SPEAKER_05]: see similar results in enzymes as the KS
increases, the correlation decreases.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it makes sense, but the
alternate explanation is that duplicates
[SPEAKER_05]: that tend to diversify quickly are the
ones that are selected and are retained.
[SPEAKER_05]: For longer time, duplicates that are
overlapping functions tend to get lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how to distinguish between
that hypothesis and over time,
[SPEAKER_05]: they diverge hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, there's a lot going on under
the hood with those curves, as you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know a lot about polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the other mechanisms that actually
preserve genes in polyploids but not in
[SPEAKER_03]: single duplicates is dosage balance
constraints, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of nuance, basically,
to those graphs that I don't get into here
[SPEAKER_03]: at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, that's one of the things we're
exploring, is can you see correlations
[SPEAKER_03]: between dosage-sensitive genes versus
preservation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a whole lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that in the Arabidopsis paper to
some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably do that again here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's a lot happening with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking a bit more about these
assumptions on the life of gene
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication, have those assumptions been
experimentally tested?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Laura's asking whether the assumptions
of shared or preserved function at
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication, could those assumptions be
tested?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure you even need to,
to know that they're really wrong in some
[SPEAKER_03]: cases, frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so for example, I didn't get into
this in the seminar, but if you think
[SPEAKER_03]: about the difference between just
duplicating a gene right in situ versus
[SPEAKER_03]: transposing it to someplace in the dark
matter of the genome where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're around a bunch of transposable
elements, there's no way that that gene is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the same function.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet it's considered a duplicate,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is a retrotransposon kind of
situation, or when you actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: you chop out the introns and everything,
and you're going to put that gene in
[SPEAKER_03]: there, call that a duplication,
and is that really going to have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: function?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other complicating factor is that when
we talk about autopolyploidy, so when we
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about polyploidy, often people think,
just make the assumption it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: duplication of the genome, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But an awful lot of polyploidy,
probably all polyploidy, involves
[SPEAKER_03]: hybridization, either in the systematics
and evolutionary biology sense of being
[SPEAKER_03]: between two species, or in the plant
breeder sense, I'm looking at the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders in the audience here,
who think of a hybrid as being between two
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties of maize, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost everything probably when
polyploids originate involves some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a cross, different genotypes are involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to say in an era when we know that
there's allele-specific expression
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in pretty much every gene,
right, to think that those are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: identical, no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think you need to test that
assumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bad assumption, but it's the best
we can do for something that happened
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
