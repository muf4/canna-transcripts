[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here and to lead off
these lightning talks, and I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try to do this without going
through the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just share I've been working
on reduced soil systems for vegetables for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years and focus in on both
conventional and organic systems that are
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for vegetable crops and margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at these systems and
evaluate them, we are including many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the goals that we've already heard about
through all the people's presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to highlight a couple of them
that are important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate resilience, of course,
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our vegetable crops aren't as vigorous
necessarily in the early part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season as some of our agronomic crops,
so we have to have really suitable
[SPEAKER_00]: seedbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So creating systems that allow for deeper
rooting of crops so that they can acquire
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and nutrients from deeper in the soil
is one of our driving factors for these
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced soil systems, as well as to
improve infiltration of water so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: capture and retain that water a year like
this is a reminder of why we have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area, so from the environmental
side, there's many ways that we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all of those in line with the
soil health goals that we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the crop productivity,
we want our vegetable crops have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting timely harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so creating an environment for rapid
crop establishment and growth are really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an area that we focus in on quite a
bit is on the improvement in not just soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health, but farmer quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think about labor use and labor
efficiency in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly can some of those early season
tasks be completed to allow that producer
[SPEAKER_00]: or manager to actually get to other really
important tasks to be timely in these
[SPEAKER_00]: delta crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another major challenge that we
face with reducing tillage in vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: crops is weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tends to be a focus of our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we view reduced tillage in a system as
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that when we can stack
these different practices and layer them,
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil health practices,
that there's an additive benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so reducing tillage or cover cropping
by themselves will improve soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we layer that and integrate those
together and add different rotations and
[SPEAKER_00]: think about other kinds of amendments,
we will achieve our soil health goals more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And therein lies the rub with vegetable
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because given their sensitivity,
to establishment conditions and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, trying to optimize cover crop
growth and a lot of residue on the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: surface is a direct sort of competition
and contradiction to the conditions we
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to prefer for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our growers very often are growing
cover crops, protecting the soil over the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, but killing them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't get the benefit of the
biomass, the carbon additions to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are novel systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are new approaches, new equipment
that can help us manage that residue more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively or improve the way that we
establish our crops in that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: residue?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the weed control strategies,
both chemical and non-chemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: through cultivation that can help us
achieve that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that you have to be mindful
in the case of vegetables, particularly of
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity of scale and the diversity
of crop products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've worked on systems that use
equipment-based approaches that are large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, using an example like the zone till
unit here, the zone builder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have to think about,
for smaller farms, those that can't invest
[SPEAKER_00]: in that type of equipment, who don't
necessarily have that kind of horsepower
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull that equipment on their farm,
what's a suitable approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use a reduced till strategy that
looks at multiple approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example in some of our work with
organic farming that we've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: recently is really trying to optimize a
no-till system for very small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've found that using these types of
impermeable tarps that we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare a soil bed in the fall and then
use cover cropping or other sorts of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches and then tarp them in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates a beautiful condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It warms the soil and allows us to
actually have a no-till system that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: continued over multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we innovate and continuously try
to integrate practices over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We demonstrated that we can grow
vegetables in a reduced till system for
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our real objective is, how do we then
help growers overcome their concerns about
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of these systems and adapt them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd like to be able to just leave
you with a few ideas to sort of foster
[SPEAKER_00]: some thinking as we go forward in this day
and thinking about this roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need to really be
continuing in vegetable crops to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the ways that we do the stacking,
integrating and maximizing the biomass and
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits of cover crops in a reduced
till system and making sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable to large and small farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using regional type of soil health
experiments or having even on farms
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term soil health planting or fields
allows us to create spaces of innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: and help growers think together about how
do we innovate these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating incentives for access to some of
the specialized equipment as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: co-ops to allow smaller scale operators
actually be sharing equipment together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the ways that we can do that and
make that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still need other ways to actually
include and remember and create
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for smaller scale growers to
really be able to look at these systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and integrate them because we know we can
save a lot of labor and money and help
[SPEAKER_00]: improve profitability on those farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I think that's interesting in New
York is we have really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have these incentives through something
like the New York Growning Certified that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes AEM Tier 2 type assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we elevate within that the soil
health practices there and make them more
[SPEAKER_00]: visible because right now they're actually
buried within the various parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tiers and in some of the worksheets but
create a more comprehensive vision
[SPEAKER_00]: statement around that in talking about our
New York Growning Certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, I think as mentioned
earlier by Pat, we have this benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: really productive soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we prioritize soil health practices
and keep on helping think about our
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term food security, particularly for
us and for me in thinking about that with
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables?
