[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard enough to follow Alan Armitage,
but now I have to follow that intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a cool thing that showed up on
the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me I was supposed to talk about
edible diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is edible flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For starters, those are cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to enjoy taking you through
some of the stories about edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what I'm supposed to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see if all these little wires
start working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Betsy and Neil, who were putting
the program together, asked me to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work on diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you about edible
diseases, at least at the beginning here
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have the first edible disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may have eaten this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we used to call the
sulfur shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's bright orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my husband Robert will not touch it,
because he says food should not be that
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very weak parasite of trees,
more of a saprophite, but it can cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: weak rot of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get sort of a brown heart rot
in a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have revenge on this particular
disease by eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an edible disease, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love your turf, you'll think of
this as fairy ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a disease, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A fairy ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think of those as places toads
sit, but it's better to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: fairies dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however you get close enough,
you can realize that's also an edible
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, because you have chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly edible, perfectly wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, one that all the people
who watch trees perish in their landscapes
[SPEAKER_00]: get to know, armillaria mellia,
which causes armillaria root rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the shoestring root rot, has an alter
ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known as the honey fungus,
because it creates a mushroom when it
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits up from the sick roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can eat that mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very delicious mushroom with a
Swedish kind of flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, you've got a plant disease
that is truly inedible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just one last one, because it's still
before lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can handle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always think of corn as an
ornamental, but there is an ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: popcorn now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back for many years, we've had an
edible disease of the corn plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have ever seen corn smut?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a very interesting thing that
will take the kernels of the corn and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: them into these big swollen white balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those balls are later on filled with
white smut spores, because this is a smut
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amazing thing is that the Mexicans
in particular really value this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely valuable food stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got to travel down to Mexico
years ago, we were able to get tacos that
[SPEAKER_00]: had huitlacoche in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes like spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of hype for something that tastes
like spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of the diseases we can have
revenge on by consuming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this doesn't apply to too
many of our ornamental plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and diseases are just a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to know that there is a
possibility for a little revenge on the
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases that are ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the crops that I find growers
getting most aware of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan was absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people say vegetables, they mean
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the greenhouse growers who
used to grow flowers all understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now growing flowers plus tomatoes
if they're not touching anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing they figured out quite
a while ago was that that also included
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see on my list basil and
rosemary, because they are grown so widely
[SPEAKER_00]: by the folks who used to think in terms of
geraniums and poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also tomatoes, peppers, kale,
and the cucumber and squash group,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the topics I'll touch on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're doing a little disease walk
about this afternoon, I can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other horrible, dreadful
diseases like the ones that are attacking
[SPEAKER_00]: begonias and attacking impatience and what
have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the diseases of edible
crops, below ground, it's pretty much all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same fungi, things like pythium and
rhizectonia and phytophthora are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to go after the roots of your
edibles just like they can go after the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of your flower crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate thing is you have a lot
fewer things you can do about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't whip out the banrot to treat
your edible plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be an even better grower
when you're producing the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need to have extremely good
sanitation so that you can pull these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops through without using things
illegally and unsafely on the edible
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example, phytophthora on
lavender, a very common disease problem
[SPEAKER_00]: because lavenders want to be in a nice
Mediterranean climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put them in the greenhouse and
water them along with everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, one problem is the sanitation
because the phytophthora can be there and
[SPEAKER_00]: pounce on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more wetness you have,
the more horrendous an epidemic can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start out with basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the one that drives the
most people the craziest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a long list of the things that can
go wrong with basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll focus mostly on the downy mildew
because that's certainly the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: problem on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have an assortment of difficulties
for that crop potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have viruses like the INSV and the
TSWV up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have various fungal problems like
anthracnoses or circospora leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even have a systemic disease,
a fusarium wilt disease, root rot
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in other parts of the world,
they even have rust and powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start importing basil from other
places, we may get those diseases on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ones that you have listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upper left there, you'll see some modeling
on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the look of TSWV or INSV,
the two viruses carried by thrips that can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this a lot because the basil tends
to be grown right there along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting produced flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your cutting produced flowers are one
of the ways you're going to get TSWV or
[SPEAKER_00]: INSV going in the green ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips can move it from one plant to the
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basil is one of the susceptible plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the many things you need
to protect your basil against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the right is an image that I
took up here in Ithaca when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil and I were doing some experiments
with basil and we got the fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't expecting it, but unfortunately
that particular disease is spread by seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, gee, sometimes I think these
grafting ideas are good because if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get away from everyone working with seed
that has sort of unknown cleanliness,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be able to get away from the
possibility of a fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it can kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a rare wall, we'll see an
anthracnose or a circospora leaf spot like
[SPEAKER_00]: you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the big one, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lighting, it's not too obvious,
but there's a little yellowing on that
[SPEAKER_00]: basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you turn the leaf over,
you see a little dirt on the underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the telephone, people have told
me that that looks like botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll mention that the leaf is still
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the look of downy mildew
starting out on the underside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: basil leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found last year when we did some
experiments with a slow release fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: combined with a fungicide that the more
you fertilize a plant, the more impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make the downy mildew look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get large yellow window panes when
the downy mildew is going after basil in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high-fertilized situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more of the field look,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer initially back when this was not
a well-known disease would look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: and think he needed to add more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly changed now to where
people are really watching all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: for downy mildew to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a contrast here between the downy
mildew on the basil and the downy mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: on coleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we thought they might be the
same organism, but it turns out they
[SPEAKER_00]: really aren't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same under the microscope
when they make their spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spores are pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a lesson in nitpicking here,
just for those of you who think people at
[SPEAKER_00]: universities are a little geeky and worry
about details.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we can tell them apart is because
one of them is sort of a 1.24
[SPEAKER_00]: length-to-breadth ratio versus a 1.29
length-to-breadth ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call this broadly ellipsoidal
versus egg-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that picky you or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really close in size,
but you can measure the difference if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even better yet, now we have DNA
analysis where we can really compare one
[SPEAKER_00]: organism to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of base pairs
different in those two organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with the coleus not really
being named yet, and the disease on the
[SPEAKER_00]: basil is perinospora belbaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, this is important to you as
a garden center or whatever because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to worry about the downy mildew
on your coleus moving into your basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because we do have a
coleus problem with a very similar downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to the basil, this story is
not terribly long because we haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: this disease in the United States or in
North America until 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is new to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why basil used to grow so well,
and now it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these things that we run into
because we have global distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been quite a problem since it
showed up in Florida in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably only about a year after we
started having trouble with the coleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that furry growth of the spores on
the underside of the leaf, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it looks like under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sort of a little tree,
and you get these little footballs hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ends of the branches that you can
only see with the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curious thing about this disease is
that it actually was known first in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seen in Uganda in 1933,
and then people were not paying a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of attention to it, but there was an
outbreak in 1994 where it started moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started moving around Europe,
and it wasn't too long after that that we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw it in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a worldwide problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the little yellow spots show you
places where this disease has appeared
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much all the places where anyone
would ever grow basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One curious slant is that it shows up in
microgreens also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about a way to devastate a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of yellow modeling that
shows when you have better lighting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: image here at the left, and you can see
the dirtiness on the underside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cotyledons of those little basil
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a microgreen producer,
you just have to hang it up when you see
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get your crop through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible, and then you can't really
get the other crops through that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: just behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really clear everything out
and start over again once the spores have
[SPEAKER_00]: died down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a devastating problem, and it's
quite obvious in this situation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a seed-borne problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely can get started from the
seed, so no matter how early your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has started, you might have a problem with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, we had a company that got
interested in doing grafted basil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without proper respect for the downy
mildew, and it became a problem in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did you sell these for,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have those?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling for somewhere between
$25 and $50 a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Greenwich, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was $25 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot to sell a basil plant for,
mind you, but they did also in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: come with some downy mildew, so those
plants were complete losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid a lot for your initial grafted
plant, and then you could not sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get into these special new crops,
we really are to look for their Achilles'
[SPEAKER_00]: heels and plan for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meg McGrath, who works in vegetable plant
pathology with me down at the Long Island
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticultural Research and Extension
Center, had put together some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: data collection on the subject of basil
downy mildew by using the web to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to tell her what was happening
where.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's got some interesting stats on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known about the disease in New York
and Florida for, now it would be more like
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, because this slide's a few years
old, but you can see New York's always at
[SPEAKER_00]: the epicenter of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up here, 74 reports from New York up
until 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we were going around giving
talks about it, and everybody was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah, we've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really worse in New York,
but don't for one moment think that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a southern person's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disease of the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly a disease of the
greenhouse industry as well as the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you as greenhouse industry people want
to make sure you're not sharing that
[SPEAKER_00]: disease with farmers in your vicinity any
earlier than they're going to have to cope
[SPEAKER_00]: with it for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also is a real global aspect to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing up in places, you know,
Argentina is having to fight basil downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important effort on this is the same
one that we're going to see with other
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked into the types of basil and
how susceptible they are, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: now at least two major breeding programs,
Rutgers and one at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, where they're looking to get us
something that's not as susceptible as the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard osimum basilicum or however that
should be pronounced, because your basic
[SPEAKER_00]: Genovese basil is highly susceptible to
downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they noticed that if you had the
Americanum species that you would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: much less highly susceptible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are efforts to breed those
genetics into the plant that we're selling
[SPEAKER_00]: that will ultimately become pesto or a
caprese salad or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been some success along
those lines, but we're not quite there
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, some of you have probably
grown the Eleonora, which is a sweet basil
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a little bit of resistance in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it won't get the disease,
but it'll get a little slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on the market at the moment,
probably one of the better options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason why we're finding the
seed transmission, and that's because the
[SPEAKER_00]: downy mildew makes a special kind of spore
that allows it to reside within the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it through that winter period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could treat the seed to get rid of the
problem, except for the fact that basil
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are really goopy when you get them
in hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only one company in Europe at
this point that is treating seed to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the downy mildew, and they're using
a steam treatment method that somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: avoids the gloppiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get some of that European
heat-treated material out of Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll be better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gloppy is not a botanical term,
but it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who didn't understand that term?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll define it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of basil that gets,
basil seed that has the problem is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are European figures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they did one survey, they found that
it was virtually in everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that when you planted it out,
a pretty high percentage of those seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lots were going to give them disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been feeling like it's just
you and there's something really torturing
[SPEAKER_00]: you, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's seed contamination, and it's very
hard to avoid it.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant is contaminated,
when that plant is being grown as a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, there is infection of the entire
plant systemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a systemic disease, so it can come
from inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It survives long enough to produce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant survives long enough to produce
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have to be a later infection for
just that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets inside and stays inside
as Ospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one really interesting little
thing which I'm hoping this industry can
[SPEAKER_00]: be clever enough to capitalize on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the research in Israel has shown
that light really impedes the spore
[SPEAKER_00]: production of the basil downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stop infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it stopped infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can keep the leaves directly in
contact with light, you can stop spore
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really stops your epidemic,
or at least slows it down a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've done things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce their basil in fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the night, they're just stringing
lights over them and providing light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're getting something like 18 days
of protection on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker the canopy gets, the more you
have parts of the plant that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: directly exposed to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your effectiveness goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing something like
microgreens, you could really make use of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will illustrate the idea for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those blue things on the left are test
tube caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after these plants were sprayed with
sporangia of downy mildew, the test tube
[SPEAKER_00]: caps were placed on and then given a
little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only places where you got spore
production three days later were over at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right where you see the darkness,
the places where the test tubes kept the
[SPEAKER_00]: light off.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, really nifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use this to your betterment,
whether you can make it go away completely
[SPEAKER_00]: that way, I would doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could probably make things better
by supplying light during your basil
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of things you want
to think about if you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: basil through without downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, buy clean seed that has been
treated with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to go with your less susceptible
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be getting better all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in four years or so, we'll have
plants we can buy that won't get this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check if you're bringing in transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look them over really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any yellowing on the leaves,
put them in a plastic bag with a wet paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel overnight and see if they're furry
underneath the next morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look for the downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a lot of scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can apply treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do need to apply treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphorus acids, rebus and ranman are
your options for chemical control in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your humidity down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play with the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experimentally see what you can do with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a problem, just get rid of
everything and then start over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also suggesting that you try to grow
basil earlier in the season because the
[SPEAKER_00]: further you get into summer, the more
likely you are to run into some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum coming in from outside the
greenhouse, getting into your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier production is safer than later
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even early production, you might get
in trouble because of seed transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all seeds contaminated, but some is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I mentioned these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are your products that are phosphorus
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the top row, just some examples of
ones that are labeled for use on basil,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like k-fide or phosphide or
Rampart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a group that's called the frac
group 33 that have phosphorus acid as
[SPEAKER_00]: their active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rebus and ranman are the things people
would be using on outdoor crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have labels that do not prohibit
use in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option for you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly OK to use that group 33
over and over again if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not prone to resistance development,
and most growers are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only going to last for about a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, next plant, rosemary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant without a lot of problems,
but it has a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my job is to tell you what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, you're going to have to battle
powdery mildew on rosemary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last year was a bad year for
powdery mildew on rosemary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the trade for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you discovered it for the first
time and were wondering why your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look white when they were supposed to look
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to have a little bit of a
waxy bloom, but not that much waxy bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this kind of a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's been dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you should be scouting for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute you see any of it,
really go right in there and start a
[SPEAKER_00]: program where you're working with
something that will stop powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once it begins in the greenhouse,
you have high enough humidity that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to keep happening in the greenhouse
all season long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a similar looking plant,
but it looks worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular case is downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only seen this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this once, but because we're
having such a bad time with downy mildews
[SPEAKER_00]: on so many other plants, I just want to
warn you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see something that is making the
plants look really unhappy, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see the powdery mildew on, keep this in
mind as one possible explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just throw it away if you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hopefully not going to be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For powdery mildew maintenance,
which is a more standard thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this experiment might give you a few
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with ultrafine oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you would probably be using soft oil
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with mil-stop and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the mil-stop and the
oil work most powerfully to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also try alternations, which is much
more of what you would be likely to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using three of those ingredients
together or alternating two of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it worked really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably mil-stop with one of the
others would be your best program to use
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep your powdery mildew managed on
rosemary in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the main one I really want to
speak to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because homeowners all want this,
but not all of you are used to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started out in the flower industry in
many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know the standard things that
any tomato grower would know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to know these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease there that's at the end of the
list, phytoptherin festans, is a scary
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought us all the Irish over from
Ireland because they were starving to
[SPEAKER_00]: death because of the effects of that
disease on the potato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somewhere along the lines,
the organism learned to switch over and
[SPEAKER_00]: also attack tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have something that's a really
serious disease that we might end up
[SPEAKER_00]: harboring in our greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a few other things
there that are every day for a farmer that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might not know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ones you do know about is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple years ago, just a year before,
a season before this, we had a real scare
[SPEAKER_00]: about TMV, tobacco mosaic virus,
on Petunias in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you carried a crop all the way
through, you might see symptoms like these
[SPEAKER_00]: where you get a variegation or a mottling
in the flowers of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early season, many growers also saw
strap-like leaves or stunting or dead
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves because of the effects of TMV on
Petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from an error up at the source
of your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company that had that problem
worked bent over backwards to clean it all
[SPEAKER_00]: up and have a good year this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad to see that extra sanitation
will defend us against this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many people did learn that it was
scary because they learned that Petunias
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a source of trouble for tomatoes
in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a huge host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest danger would be heirloom
tomatoes because they don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: natural resistance built into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing Petunias,
particularly if you're bringing them in as
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings from offshore, really try to keep
your tomatoes away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the smartest things you can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of thing you can do to a
tomato fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a lot of other ugly things you
might not even get to fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that nonfat dry milk is one of
our most useful control materials when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with TMV in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do find that you have it,
respond with an excellent sanitation
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal and a lot of use of dry milk
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, bacterial leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the many things that we have to
worry about on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this, you know, seven or eight
times this year down on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty common disease on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably all have it at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not easy to tell which one is which,
but there are three bacterial leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that can occur in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial spots, the most common,
which is a xanthomonas bacterium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also bacterial canker and
bacterial speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a fungal leaf spot that you're
probably not going to be able to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference from, which is the one here at
the lower right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a septoria leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also pretty common on tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work against that, the farmers have
learned to use treated seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that you folks are always
getting treated seed, but maybe you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to look into that because hot water
treatment will eliminate some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use copper and agrimicin type
fungicides on tomato and pepper in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, but not necessarily on any of
your other crops because they're labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: for specific vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reduce your leaf wetness and
splashing because that can move bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: from place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really inspect your plants and throw
away problems while they're still small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want to do a lot of treatment,
but just an occasional copper maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: spray may help you stay out of a big
problem with this kind of leaf spotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another spotter on tomato is tomato
spotted wilt virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard a lot about this virus as
ornamental producers before you ever grew
[SPEAKER_00]: a tomato, but there's a reason why it's
called tomato spotted wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make spots on tomato, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks a little different each time,
just as it looks different on each of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can look different on each tomato
cultivar that you might grow, and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another one of the things you
don't want to get into your vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This virus isn't on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can keep your cutting grown
crops and your thrips away from tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're producing from seed,
that'll do a great deal of good to keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: TSWV away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get fruit symptoms as well as spots
when you have TSWV in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that helps you
identify it are these blackish streaks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are down the middle of the leaf
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite typical of TSWV on a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really ugly things can happen to
the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your customers won't like TSWV on their
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the flowers and the vegetables
apart would be great for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible for some of you,
but it's a goal, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will help our future production
because we don't like being in a situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have, for example, a material
that you can spray on one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's illegal to spray on the one
beside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good situation to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think keeping things separate will
really help us in the future and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely watching them and knowing what
the symptoms are so that you can pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: on them just as they're starting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late blight will cause large dead areas in
the leaves, and it can look a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with a grower a couple years ago
who was treating for botrytis because he
[SPEAKER_00]: thought he had botrytis in his tomatoes
because he was a flower grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew botrytis, but he didn't know about
late blight, which causes large lesions
[SPEAKER_00]: with maybe a pale rim around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can also cause stem lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can make out that these are
a little bit frosty, and that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot of the sporangia produced on
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phytoptherin festans that causes this
late blight disease is truly genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to a downy mildew,
and it's airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can move great distances,
and it's really a pernicious threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of thing it does to a
tomato, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good thing, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can do this to a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know it can go to petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that goes to petunias,
but this is one of Margot Bechtel's slides
[SPEAKER_00]: who got her PhD here at Cornell a number
of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: She caused this particular infection,
but this is a picture from a box that was
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped into me sometime that incubated en
route and got real fuzzy on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can occasionally have that
disease in petunias, so watch for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you see anything remotely
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from the botrytis-like
late blight infection that occurred a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have no idea what the source was,
and we're thinking it might have been some
[SPEAKER_00]: solanaceous ornamentalite of Central
America that was growing in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain was tested here at Cornell,
and we know it's not the standard strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a listing that you don't need to
pay a whole lot of attention to,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than to see that the strain called U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 is sensitive to methanoxin,
which is in subdue max, and that one
[SPEAKER_00]: affects potato and tomato, and it's the
dominant one that we've been seeing in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York for the past several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good in some ways, bad in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of Meg's maps that gives
you a sense, if you follow the dates,
[SPEAKER_00]: of how the late blight disease would
ordinarily start down in Florida and move
[SPEAKER_00]: its way up the coast and get to us late,
which is why it's called late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our greenhouse industry ships plants all
over creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2009, there was enough shipping of
contaminated tomatoes from the South that
[SPEAKER_00]: it got all over the Northeast,
and it was a really early epidemic problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the farmers in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to inspect our crops and make sure
we're not moving late blight around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This repeats everything I just said,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely watch for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be common, but it's bad
if you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give you some hope here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's information now on some cultivars
that are resistant to late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an industry, particularly if you're
a garden center, you can really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people by offering and promoting the late
blight resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to have the same
control at the right-hand side for each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Fresh Plus, obviously,
is susceptible to the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blighted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over at the left, you see Mountain Merit,
which looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up at the top, it's got a little
notation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you it has two different genes
for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we go to Iron Lady, nice name,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mountain Fresh Plus, of course,
looks really dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have Mountain Magic,
which has probably gotten the most
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody sold Mountain Fresh Plus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Magic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see the hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've got Jasper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasper's a cherry tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really very, very good resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the tomatoes look like at the
upper right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Meg's husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sandy Menashe, our vegetable agent
down at the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasper's a really high-performing cherry
tomato, resistant to the late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this information's all on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meg has an excellent website that you can
get to that's a vegetable MD site that's
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the page for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resistance is coming from a wild
relative of the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Solanum Pippinellifolium is where
those genes are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank goodness for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that will, with time, breed us out
of this problem and make everything
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an app, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meg and I worked together on one with the
Plant Pathology Society that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The notes are in your handout sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look under either Plant Health or
Tomato MD, with a space between tomato and
[SPEAKER_00]: MD, it's not as pretty as Alan's app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all sick plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's a single healthy
plant in the entire app.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to have one for reference
when you're talking to gardeners at your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden center or you have tomatoes at
home, it has 350 or so pictures of sick
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very true, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain ones that are Solanum will
definitely harbor late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest harbor is, however,
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll get potato volunteers the
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't overwinter in tomato,
per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But potato is a very bad carryover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you alternate between potato and
tomato in your fields and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes coming up among the tomatoes,
the disease will come right along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weed control doesn't hurt either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple things on pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ornamental pepper is prone to
bacterial leaf species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the non-ornamental pepper is
prone to bacterial leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, copper might be useful to you
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen INSV on peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all sorts of interesting different
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pale spots, brown spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The INSV really moves in on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even a zigzag line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see that symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could only be caused by a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else that can give you
that kind of a pattern in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other whole disease curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you might be aware of and might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powdery mildew we're used to seeing on
verbenas also goes to cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing verbenas as flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, hey, new one this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started having a lot of trouble with
calibracholas with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have movement from the cucurbit
back and forth to the verbena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to know those are good
things to keep apart and be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen pumpkins looking white in
the fall, that's from powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very damaging to the fruits and tends
to create sun scorch when they've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those spores can blow into the
greenhouse if you're thinking of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: verbena over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can keep the powdery mildew
over on the verbena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't say this, except I've seen
people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll keep verbena in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wonder why their zucchini
are looking funny the next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: They managed to keep the inoculum over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will see the same disease on
petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly in the field at the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of variation from one
verbena to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that problem has gone way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry really got rid of the
cultivars that were highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's a common problem
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe the calibrachoa problem is on
the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch them and keep the powdery mildew
under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't want to cause the
farmers in your area to have extra trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: with early epidemics because you're
growing that same disease on your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial things are bothering our kale
and ornamental cabbage growers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the farmers know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not if you're coming in from the
ornamental side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an ornamental kale with yellow
wedges in the leaves, starting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower leaves and climbing up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease is called black rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a xanthomonas, not the same one
that goes to geraniums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's seed-borne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the kale got more popular the past
few years, I think it lowered the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody was scrambling to get
enough seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly the red boar cultivar of
kale has been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real problem for our growers in
recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a systemic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in a cross section of the
stem, little black areas where the
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular system is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over at the right, maybe you can
envision there's a pulsing out of lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: little bacterial cells in water from a cut
vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really an easily spread disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good for you to be aware of it so
that you will be able to recognize it and
[SPEAKER_00]: rogue out the plants that have that
problem and go on to grow the rest with
[SPEAKER_00]: the help of some copper sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are all handleable if you're
not ignorant of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just being aware of what the problems
are that can affect your edible crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in the greenhouse will help
you a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully everything can just be
hunky-dory in your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take any questions just
because of our time situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want you to have a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll all have a chance to ask me
questions this afternoon when we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
