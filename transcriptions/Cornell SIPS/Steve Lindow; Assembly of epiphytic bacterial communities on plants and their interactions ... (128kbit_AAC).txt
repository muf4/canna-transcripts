[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thanks, daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome all from smoky California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another beautiful sunny but smoky day
and really unfortunate we can't meet in
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of hoping to see some nice
colorful East Coast scenes here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall but we're going to be doing this all
at home at our our new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm going to talk about basically
the plant microbiome and you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome science is really hot these
days but not that many people look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and other microbes on the surface
of plants and that's really what I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get you excited about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about epiphytes,
microbes that live on the surface of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and really think they got a lot of
interesting features.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're certainly very pertinent to plant
pathology but we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about their context in a number of
different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to study mostly epiphytic
bacteria and we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about those that live on the surface of
healthy plants for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this image is a typical image of a leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tunnel-like object you're looking
down is a stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very small obviously and on the
surface are these large numbers of small
[SPEAKER_01]: blobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the bacterial cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very typical of all healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's somewhere between about 10,000 and
about 10 million of these kind of bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: found per square centimeter of leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically edible plants, non-edible
plants, they're all going to have very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are very abundant on the planet
obviously so there's about Avogadro's
[SPEAKER_01]: number of bacteria when you consider all
of the plants and all of the bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be considered on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably an underestimate because
there's really been very little look of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that are on plants in tropical
areas and it's very likely that microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: on tropical plants that are wet all the
time are likely to be even higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now much of the study of epiphytes has
been driven by plant disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been known for a while that
pathogens, especially plant pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria exist as epiphytes on healthy
plants before inciting disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact we can often predict disease
based on the population size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that are essentially inoculant
can eventually enter and cause disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of examples of those are
bacterial brown spots a lot of being in
[SPEAKER_01]: the upper right and fire blight on the
lower right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both classic examples of how
pest management is attuned to the
[SPEAKER_01]: population of these microbes on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with low populations of microbes
on the plants there's very little
[SPEAKER_01]: likelihood that even if environmental
conditions became favorable that disease
[SPEAKER_01]: would ever occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything else being equal higher
populations will increase the likelihood
[SPEAKER_01]: of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again this has been driven a lot by
plant pathology and the system is very
[SPEAKER_01]: very much like human skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have staph aureus on our skin and
disease is really unlikely unless we do
[SPEAKER_01]: have inoculant present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now other groups of microbes that get a
little less attention but I think are
[SPEAKER_01]: quite interesting and very important is
bacteria that catalyze ice formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is work that I worked on long ago
bacteria that catalyze ice are very
[SPEAKER_01]: prominent on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact that's basically the only place
you would find these microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are quite unique in that they
have the ability to catalyze ice and water
[SPEAKER_01]: that would otherwise super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see in the graph on the right hand
side the ability of water is super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water does not freeze at zero degrees
Celsius to form ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact it will super cool to temperatures
easily and even as cold as our around
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these bacteria can catalyze ice at a
temperature of about minus one or minus
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that water cannot remain
liquid to those cold temperatures but it
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise would.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very important to plant because
plants are mostly water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria that live on the plants then
limit the ability of that water within the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when ice forms we get a mechanical
damage to the plant we call frost damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again it's because of the bacteria
that plants do in fact freeze because
[SPEAKER_01]: without the bacteria present plants
themselves can easily super cool to around
[SPEAKER_01]: minus six, minus seven degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water in those plants will remain
liquid super cool but in the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria they will in fact nucleate
and freeze at a temperature of around
[SPEAKER_01]: minus one to minus two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's typically where we start to see
frost damage in plants is around 28,
[SPEAKER_01]: 29 degrees Fahrenheit minus two Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again it's the population size of
these bacteria that drive the freezing
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very high population size of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will not super cool more than
to around minus two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we decrease the population sizes of
the bacteria on the plant the plant has
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to super cool and approaches a
temperature of around minus five or minus
[SPEAKER_01]: six when they're going to start to freeze
because of other substances within the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that cause nucleation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you actually get up and watch plants
freeze you'll see images like you see on
[SPEAKER_01]: the upper left where these are citrus
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a picture in the morning around
minus four degrees Celsius out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see dew drops on the leaves that are
still liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this darkened area ice has started
to form and you can actually see dew drops
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting to look icy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Presumably because a particular bacterium
at that site catalyzed ice formation and
[SPEAKER_01]: that ice is now going to start spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a few minutes this cluster of
leaves would have been frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again bacteria limit the super cooling
ability of plants and thereby cause frost
[SPEAKER_01]: damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also one of the justifications
for a lot of the work that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about today is can we modify the
communities after knowing enough how they
[SPEAKER_01]: form to reduce the population sizes of
either pathogens or in this case isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these bacteria not only are they
interesting and important on plants but
[SPEAKER_01]: they're also actually quite important in a
whole global precipitation cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out for various reasons the
bacteria that catalyze ice are most common
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little later on I'm going to talk about
the escape of bacteria from leaves to go
[SPEAKER_01]: up into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very abundant about a million or so per
square meter per hour leaf leaf surfaces
[SPEAKER_01]: fly up in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had clouds above you you would see
that most of the water in those clouds are
[SPEAKER_01]: super cool water droplets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very cold fog if you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: These super cold water droplets are small
they don't fall out of the cloud because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're too small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if ice starts to form in this case by
a bacterial cell interacting with these
[SPEAKER_01]: drops of water the drops of water will
start to coalesce and form larger and
[SPEAKER_01]: larger particles of ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually those ice crystals get big
enough that they're too large to be
[SPEAKER_01]: supported in the cloud and they start
falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always start falling as ice and if
it's warm on the way down it melts and we
[SPEAKER_01]: call it rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cold all the way down we call it
snow but much of the precipitation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperate part of the world except for
very close to the equator is driven by
[SPEAKER_01]: this ice forming process in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because bacteria are again emigrating
from plants into the air they are now
[SPEAKER_01]: thought to be some of the major
participants in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain minerals and other things can also
do it but these bacteria because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: so efficient at catalyzing ice at a warm
temperature are thought to be particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you who are skiers or
boarders these ice nucleating bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: including Pseudomonas syringae the most
common and important ice nucleator are
[SPEAKER_01]: used to make artificial snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow up Pseudomonas syringae freeze
dry and add it to the water that's blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the air so that you get ice forming
in the air rather than freezing rain if
[SPEAKER_01]: you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's become a huge industrial process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some million pounds or so a year of
freeze-dried bacteria are made for
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could say I made a penny out of
it but hopefully Pseudomonas syringae
[SPEAKER_01]: making the world a little better in that
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again what are the bacteria doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw nucleators and pathogens but most
bacteria aren't either but many bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that live on plants are thought to be
important in protecting plants against
[SPEAKER_01]: other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite indisputable and a classic
example of that phenomenon would be fire
[SPEAKER_01]: blight of pears and apples and the
presence of other bacteria that do not
[SPEAKER_01]: cause disease being able to protect
against pathogens that do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a typical scenario the flowers of an
apple in this case are emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants as they emerge into the world
are almost sterile without any bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and this case the stigma of the surface of
the pistol is certainly free of pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it become inoculated with a pathogen
shown by little red cells there they can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow rapidly on a stigmatic surface get to
high populations that can eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: invade the flower and eventually cause
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know though that if we were to
inoculate that stigma soon after it
[SPEAKER_01]: emerged with a non-pathogen it will grow
to high numbers as well and then if the
[SPEAKER_01]: immigration of the pathogen were to occur
there's limited opportunity for it to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: because of either competition or anabiosis
and its population size remains
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiently low and that disease is
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the classic examples of
biological control where here you see one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the strains we found Sinomonas
fluorescens A506 being applied to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers of these trees early in the spring
so that the process of colonization of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wood is accelerated to offer some
protection against the pathogen and there
[SPEAKER_01]: are other bacteria and yeast that are now
being used for a similar mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about how and
why do bacteria grow on plants and part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it is simply diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have carbon to grow and it
seemed like the abundance of various
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon containing compounds is the
limiting factor for the growth of these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found some years ago that in fact the
bacterial numbers are limited by the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of sugar and that plants vary a lot
in the amount of these nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: found on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some like cucumbers and tomatoes and beans
are much higher than peas and corn when
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at either the number of amount of
sugar that's found on a plant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial numbers that can result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk a lot about sugar because sugar
does seem to be the primary carbon source
[SPEAKER_01]: on most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at bean leaves as an example
sucrose glucose and fructose are by far
[SPEAKER_01]: the most abundant carbon containing
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some organic acids and amino
acids and all but together there is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few micrograms per leaf of
these carbon but if you add it up that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: route enough to generate about a hundred
million bacteria on a leaf and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: about the population size that we
typically see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be a carbon but not a
nitrogen limited situation but more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly and what's going to be central
to a lot we're going to talk about today
[SPEAKER_01]: is the fact that this carbon does not seem
to be distributed uniformly around the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now using a sugar biosensor in this case
for the sugar fructose a fructose
[SPEAKER_01]: responsive promoter linked to an unstable
GFP route we could examine the ability of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria to be consuming sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we put a biosensor that we had grown
up in the lab continuing that gene fusion
[SPEAKER_01]: grown without any fructose onto a leaf
come back two hours after inoculation you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see that initially they were
non-fluorescent but within two hours many
[SPEAKER_01]: if not most of the cells we applied to the
leaf had become green fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you come back and look 24 hours
after we had inoculated and you just have
[SPEAKER_01]: to believe me that in fact there's still
cells all over this leaf there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: cells in a few local areas where in fact
the cells remain green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unstable GFP has to continue to be
made to be remain fluorescent and it
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs then that there is at least a
little bit of sugar all over the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface but abundant sugar or replenishing
sugar is really only present in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of use this as an image of a
nutritional desert if you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little resource everywhere but
only a few oases of you would where the
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar has become quite abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This helps explain what you see when you
take lots of images of a leaf surface and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my former students did a lot of
studies of basically microbes on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you'll see on this image and
here's some stomata for stycin and pericin
[SPEAKER_01]: and many parts of the leaf are rather
impoverished there's little or no bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: present but you'll see occasionally these
large aggregates of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some call them biofilm but they're large
piles of bacteria if you would and this
[SPEAKER_01]: image there's probably 10,000 bacteria in
this particular image.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very numerous but they are
very very large numbers of microbes that
[SPEAKER_01]: occur in these particular sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to some numbers to that look at the
red bars here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the number of cells in a local
area we're going to call an aggregate from
[SPEAKER_01]: single cells up to thousands of cells in
aggregate and how many there were on a log
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that there's thousands of sites
where there's only one or a few cells in a
[SPEAKER_01]: given location and only a few places where
these large aggregates occur but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the red balls on the lower graph
where you look at the camellia to
[SPEAKER_01]: proportion of the population that occurred
as a function of the size of aggregate in
[SPEAKER_01]: which they occurred and let's just use 100
cells as a cutoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that more than half of all the
microbes in a cell on a leaf were in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: in these large aggregates larger than
about 100 cells and so in many ways that
[SPEAKER_01]: bring me very much like distribution of
humans on the on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: United States little circles here
represent the size of cities from over
[SPEAKER_01]: here where I live in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fly toward New York you're going to
pass over Chicago after flying over the
[SPEAKER_01]: flyover states and you look down you're
going to see lots and lots of farms as you
[SPEAKER_01]: go across certainly the Midwest but not
until you see a city area you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: really see large numbers of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always reminded me that California
which is a huge city huge state lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: forests and deserts and all but it's also
the most urbanized state in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety-seven percent of Californians live
in cities greater than a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: people including myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again most people in the world tend to
live in cities now and life in a city is
[SPEAKER_01]: very very different than where I grew up
in a country up in Oregon and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk now about the differences of being
part of these groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life in a city versus life in the country
and the first thing you can recognize is
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that looking at the cells whether
they're alive or dead after exposure to a
[SPEAKER_01]: typical daylight condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wet night today as sunny and dry in the
daytime and look at the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again and this is going to be the the
proportion of the population that is in
[SPEAKER_01]: that are living and you can see that all
of these more solitary cells for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part are dead and it's really only in
these cells that are in these large
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregates larger than about a hundred
cells and in fact those cells are alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So life is tough in the country if you
would have you're in a microbe and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not only important for you to probably
grow up amongst other cells on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface probably driven by this local
availability of sugar that's coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves but in fact immigration
successful immigration to the leaf is also
[SPEAKER_01]: very much favored by the presence of these
aggregates.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important in issues such as food
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a bit of work on salmonella
human pathogen something you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see on plants that you're eating but is
often there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that the salmonella itself is
a very poor colonist of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it is put on itself it quite quickly
dies but if we were to immigrate
[SPEAKER_01]: salmonella onto leaves and look to see
whether it landed in a barren part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf where there were not other bacteria
or whether it had landed amongst these
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregates that we had already established
on the leaf you'll see that it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: only those cells that landed amongst other
organisms that were alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these solitary cells were in fact
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this image is really what you
should think about when you think of life
[SPEAKER_01]: on a leaf that much of the leaf is
relatively poorly colonized probably
[SPEAKER_01]: because for unknown reasons there isn't
very much nutrient there but where
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are available the microbes can
make relatively large aggregations or
[SPEAKER_01]: biofilms if you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see the individual cells and
they're kind of in this cocoon of
[SPEAKER_01]: exocellular polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was at all humid it is probably
holding on to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a slime pile if you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again life within that slime pile is
probably very different from life out here
[SPEAKER_01]: where any individual cell is very unlikely
to have made enough of a modification of
[SPEAKER_01]: its environment in a biofilm if you would
to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas being part of a group there would
be this cooperation and benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: having others also modifying that
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at that image immediately made
me think of quorum sensing a growing
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm in microbiology where we used to
think of microbial cells especially
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria which are single cells and being
rather individualistic in their behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that microbes do have
very different behavior when they're part
[SPEAKER_01]: of a group than when they're solitary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This process is known as quorum sensing
where the mechanism then driving it is
[SPEAKER_01]: where individual bacteria are all bacteria
individually produce small numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: small molecules which are released from
the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cells are relatively solitary those
signal molecules basically diffuse away
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cells know that they're alone
because they can't perceive their signal
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the cells end up having neighbors
especially neighbors of their own type
[SPEAKER_01]: which are all making the same signal
molecule the local concentration of the
[SPEAKER_01]: signal molecule is going to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can then re-perceive that signal
molecule by a variety of mechanisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: use that then as a signal to change the
transcription of genes which are important
[SPEAKER_01]: to be regulated differently when they are
part of a group than when they are
[SPEAKER_01]: solitary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of cinnamon and syringine
our favorite microbe one of the traits
[SPEAKER_01]: that we know to be regulated in this way
is motility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that when the cells have an
ability to sense its signal molecule and
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're part of a group they are not
mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mutants which are blocked in the
ability to produce a signal molecule as
[SPEAKER_01]: you see on this right hand image the cells
have this in this case swarming ability
[SPEAKER_01]: able to move around actively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case it turns out that the
ability to signal and tell themselves that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're part of a group actually reduces
the virulence of cinnamon and syringine
[SPEAKER_01]: because the wild type strain makes less
disease and a mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Presumably because it's not able to move
around on leaf surface find its way to
[SPEAKER_01]: these sites where nutrients would be
available and probably also enter into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Active motility does seem to be something
you'd want to do in that kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario we're out on a nutritional desert
and you need to find the right places if
[SPEAKER_01]: you were to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also calls into question how much
fidelity there is to this system and that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that don't live in the world and
in pure cultures in the case of the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface certainly there's usually quite a
variety of microbes that live on leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The upper picture here shows a typical
leaf washing plated out and you'll see a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of microbes epiphytes tend to be
very colorful they're often red or pink or
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow part of that is due to the
sunscreen effect that you get from being
[SPEAKER_01]: pigmented.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Pseudomonas syringae often had many
other neighbors and when we look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors of Pseudomonas syringae on a
leaf we find that around 12% of other
[SPEAKER_01]: species produce the same signal molecule
the same three oxalhexanol, homocerein,
[SPEAKER_01]: lactone, and the more quorum-simpson
signal molecules that nectaridae use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 12% make the same signal of
syringae but around 8% have a mysterious
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to inhibit the production or
perception of the same signal molecule by
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well given that we were very interested to
know well could these neighbors then be
[SPEAKER_01]: influencing the the virulence of
Pseudomonas syringae because its virulence
[SPEAKER_01]: is in fact directly driven by the quorum
sensing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer was definitely yes that
show an example this strain Arwenia strain
[SPEAKER_01]: FT1 which is one that made a large amount
of the same signal molecule of Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: syringae and I might note that for
whatever reason it made about a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: times more than Pseudomonas did in its own
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now look at the just simple spray and pray
experiment where you inoculate Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: syringae by itself count how many lesions
35 lesions when inoculated together with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Arwenia the amount of infections went
way down and when we we couldn't because
[SPEAKER_01]: of this competition for signaling but in
fact when we blocked the ability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Arwenia strain to produce a signal by
introducing an AHL lactonase which
[SPEAKER_01]: basically destroyed the signal molecule
its ability to grow but not able to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the signal molecule then you see
that its presence without the signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: capability had again no effect on the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it did seem like the overwhelming trend
was the reason why that neighbor could in
[SPEAKER_01]: fact reduce signaling suggesting that we
might be able to exploit this phenomenon
[SPEAKER_01]: by having competitors that could produce
signal molecules who inhibit the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and virulence if you would of pathogens
for which signaling is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the opposite is also true and that we
had strains that interfered with
[SPEAKER_01]: Pseudomonas syringae signaling Pseudomonas
by itself made some lesions would made a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more infection when the signaling
interference strain was co-inoculated with
[SPEAKER_01]: syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again a mutant of that strain which
blocked its ability to interfere now we
[SPEAKER_01]: see no real effect of its presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in fact neighbors of Pseudomonas
syringae can actually increase disease so
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitation of disease by neighbors on a
plant is also quite possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets even more complicated because
it turns out that plants themselves can
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive the signal molecules that these
potential pathogens are producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that many plants are in fact
actually listening in to the signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: that pathogens are using to gear up to
express virulence traits to infect that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and we now know that the plants
might be participating in disease by
[SPEAKER_01]: listening in and appropriately regulating
their potential responses to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we've been interested in what are the
adaptations needed for bacteria to live in
[SPEAKER_01]: and on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria live on plants are very
distinct from those in the soil and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically what does it take to live on
a plant and at least today in California
[SPEAKER_01]: here it's raining in Ithaca but here in
California it's sunny and warm and smoky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes on a leaf surface have many
stresses they got to deal with desiccation
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things that are going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants these same pathogens certainly
can enter and start to multiply within a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and within the tissues the
apoclastic probably different requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: for exploitation of that plant than those
that needed to grow on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well Pseudomonas syringae strain B720A the
one that we've done a lot of work on over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years was one of the first to be
sequenced by JGI and we've been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: exploit that to look at the
transcriptomics of this to really look to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what are those traits that are at
least expressed on the leaf surface and
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler when he was a student actually
looked at what was the importance of those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits in actual fitness but I'll let him
tell you about that in another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we looked at the gene expression of
the bacteria under various conditions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the laboratory and the first
disappointment was the fact that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: no condition that we could look at in the
culture with low nitrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_01]: presence the kind of conditions that we
thought might mimic the leaf surface the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene expression patterns were very very
different to what we would see on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of suggests that much of what
we've been trying to do in the laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: for since microbiology started isn't
really very appropriate because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very plant specific pattern of gene
expression that we can now get at with the
[SPEAKER_01]: transcriptomics that we're going to talk
about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't just highlight a few of the
things that we saw by looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of all the genes of Pseudomonas
syringae first on the epithetic conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: and those are in the red bars what are the
traits that were particularly prominently
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed on the leaf surface flagellar
motility basically anything about motility
[SPEAKER_01]: and chemotaxis were certainly upregulated
on the leaf surface completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to any kind of condition in the
interior or on any kind of a culture
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of other things that really
struck us were things like tryptophan
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis and I'm going to come back to
talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that were typically
strongly upregulated when they're inside
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's going to be the green bars here
various toxins and there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest in various toxins made by
Pseudomonas syringae various type of
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins syringin mice and syringalides
syringal men these were certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: upregulated on the inside of the plant but
also on the surface suggesting that these
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins may also play a role in perhaps
changing the chemical or physical
[SPEAKER_01]: environment of the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that was really quite striking on the
other hand were the genes involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: production of various compatible solutes
things like trail of sugar that's able to
[SPEAKER_01]: help cells tolerate water stress and yes
we saw those upregulating on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface and the red bars but they were
very very strongly upregulated also on the
[SPEAKER_01]: interior suggesting very strongly that the
interior of a leaf is actually quite dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think most of us going into this
kind of a study suggested that the
[SPEAKER_01]: interior I've always thought it was kind
of you know moist and sugary but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite dry air penetrates into the
leaf to allow the gas exchange for
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis and we're going to talk
about another trait here in just a second
[SPEAKER_01]: syringofactin a biosufactin just made by
the bacteria made both on the interior and
[SPEAKER_01]: the exterior of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find though that many of the traits
that are expressed by Pseudomonas syringae
[SPEAKER_01]: were preferentially expressed either on
the interior of the plant or on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface but I just want to follow up on
that with two traits that made interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is tryptophan biosynthesis and one is
syringofactin, there's biosufactin and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's start with the tryptophan story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that basically almost every
microbe that you ever recover from a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has the ability to produce the plant
hormone 3-indoleicetic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very striking that very few bacteria
from other habitats have this ability but
[SPEAKER_01]: virtually all plant microbes do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leads us back to tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tryptophan is the ultimate source for
3-indoleicetic acid that you see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of this pathway and various plant
pathogens have the ability to convert
[SPEAKER_01]: tryptophan into IAA via this intermediate
indolecetamide but we find that most
[SPEAKER_01]: non-pathogens and a lot of pathogens as
well use this central pathway from
[SPEAKER_01]: indolepyruvic acid to indoleacetalide into
IAA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real question is why did the
bacteria all produce oxygen and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: just to document that no matter what taxa
you look at almost all of them make some
[SPEAKER_01]: and many make an awful lot of
3-indoleicetic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that they make enough that
they actually account for some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes that we typically associate
with the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like flower and fruit abscission,
the classical oxygen-mediated phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: A phenomenon we've been studying a lot
because of its commercial importance in
[SPEAKER_01]: California is this phenomenon called fruit
reciting where we know that the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of high numbers of oxygen-producing
bacteria on the fruit when they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: small centimeter or so in diameter in the
early spring apparently changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of the epidermal cells of the
fruit such that they die early and
[SPEAKER_01]: produces quirky dead cells that we see on
the surface of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit don't store quite as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't look as appealing to other
consumers like you see the fruit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the Bartlett pear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers actually suffer substantially
because of the lower value of these fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go into making baby food rather than
going on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, oxygen can also be used as a
signaling molecule and this has been well
[SPEAKER_01]: studied in acrobacterium and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not clear whether it's a signaling
molecule of its own right and other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-associated bacteria, but there's
some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I want to talk about was a
story of what I'm going to call resource
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why the bacteria would make
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that producing oxygen was very
important to the microbes and that when we
[SPEAKER_01]: made mutes, in this case a linea
herbicola, very common epiphyte,
[SPEAKER_01]: to block its ability to produce oxygen,
we put a mutant mixture, a mutant unable
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce a signal with the wild type
strain, put the mixture on a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: came back various times after we put them
on a plant and look at the rate change in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started out that wild type and it
increased dramatically to favor the wild
[SPEAKER_01]: type after a few generations on the plant,
suggesting that in fact it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: important to be making oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to think back again to the nutrient
story and thinking that it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon does limit the amount of growth
that microbes have on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The simple model would be that by some way
the presence of oxygen produced from
[SPEAKER_01]: production on leaf surface caused nutrient
to be released from the inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant upon the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it has to cross the cuticle and
there would be different ways in which
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be mediated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started out to test this model then
to see whether in fact in the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen would the bacteria see more sugar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does oxygen production somehow release
sugar onto the leaf surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're going to use biosensors
that we developed before in this case one
[SPEAKER_01]: for the detection of sucrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucrose being the most abundant carbon
source on most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take a sucrose responsive promoter
link in this case to a promoterless
[SPEAKER_01]: isonucleation gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isonucleation genes, single genes are
capable of from the isonucleation
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isonucleation is a very, very,
very sensitive reporter gene because of
[SPEAKER_01]: its ease for which it's detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to now look for sucrose
dependent production of isonucleation in a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain in which we would put this reporter
gene that otherwise would not have been
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of production of isonuclei.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kept coming up with the wrong
answer, so to speak, supposed to have
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, in the presence of a
oxen, in this case a synthetic oxen,
[SPEAKER_01]: naphthalenocytic acid, we actually see
less isonucleitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently the bacteria are seeing less
sucrose in the presence of the oxen than
[SPEAKER_01]: they did when there was no oxen present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink line, they're more active than the
one with the green line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did it many times, we always got the
same answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less apparent sucrose in the presence of
oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already had this sensor for fructose
that I showed you before, a GFP reporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we see that in fact in the
presence of oxen we do see apparently much
[SPEAKER_01]: more fructose being made available in the
presence of oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No oxen with oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So confusing, but it made more sense when
we started to think about what's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happening on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go back to one of the very early tables
that I showed you where there was 10
[SPEAKER_01]: micrograms of sugar on a typical bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well a bean leaf in the morning after a
dew had formed, there might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliter of dew that would form on a
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about what's the
concentration of that sugar that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be, we're talking milligrams
per liter of nutrient concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tiny concentrations of these sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the bacteria have to actively uptake
these sugars to be able to consume and
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different uptake mechanisms
for disaccharides than there are for
[SPEAKER_01]: monosaccharides like fructose and glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked whether the bacteria could
actually consume and grow at the low
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of these sugars that they
would probably see in the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And answer was quite obvious that they
could consume fructose at very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low concentrations like 0.05
milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tiny amounts of sugar were enough for
them to perceive and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucrose on the other hand, it took 10 to
100 times more sugar before they could
[SPEAKER_01]: even grow on that as a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further support of that would be
measurement of the, basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic activity of the cells in the
same kind of very low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we test that with the cell wall
synthesis inhibitor cycloserine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like penicillin, it will block cell wall
synthesis and thereby kill the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: only if the cells are in fact growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out that yes indeed,
the cells are sensitive to cycloserine at
[SPEAKER_01]: these very, very low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you can see with sucrose,
much higher concentrations of sucrose were
[SPEAKER_01]: needed before the cells became
sufficiently metabolically active trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow and were then poisoned by
cycloserine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would seem then that in fact,
carbon is in fact very limited on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, but that they are probably not
directly consuming sucrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably consuming primarily these
more easily consumable glucose and
[SPEAKER_01]: fructose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that our work didn't really get to the
point of showing, but somehow the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of IAA is going to activate these cell
wall invertases that are present in plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are now going to be making that
conversion to convert sucrose into glucose
[SPEAKER_01]: and fructose.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a variety of these cell wall
invertases, the various mutants that we
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find one particular one,
but it would appear that there is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the many cell wall invertases that are in
fact induced by the presence of IAA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, another story I want to give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, something that's happening that we
think on a very small scale on leaves is
[SPEAKER_01]: the role of biosurfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the traits that many microbes
that live on plants have is the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce these biosurfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are detergent-linked molecules,
amphipathic molecules, where we have
[SPEAKER_01]: typically a polar head group, usually some
sort of a peptide linked to an acyl chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very detergent-linked,
very hydrophilic head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Syringofactin is one such biofactor that
is produced by Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our work with new methods to detect
biosurfactant production in bacteria as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole revealed that biosurfactant
production was particularly prominent
[SPEAKER_01]: among bacteria on plants compared to other
kinds of settings like soil and water and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do the biosurfactants being do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly they might act as a detergent if
you would and simply disperse water on
[SPEAKER_01]: this very waxy surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found actually that it seemed to
have two particular traits that are even
[SPEAKER_01]: with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is that it seemed to be able to
alter the permeability of this waxy
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle that covers most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there's a waxy cuticle made up
of a variety of materials, which blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: not only the loose loss of water from the
plant, but would also block the movement
[SPEAKER_01]: of any kind of polar molecules like sugars
up onto the surface of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now working with a group in Germany,
Professor Schreiber, we could peel off
[SPEAKER_01]: epidermal peels, which would contain the
cuticle, put them on the surface of a
[SPEAKER_01]: basically tritiated water, and we could
watch the diffusion of tritium across that
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, an intact cuticle, there's a
very slow movement of tribium,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when we put then biosurfactant,
in this case syringofactant, onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of that cuticle, immediately the
rate of movement of the tritium across
[SPEAKER_01]: that cuticle increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simplistically, I simply see it as
essentially dissolving that cuticle,
[SPEAKER_01]: as disrupting it in some way to make it
more permeable to polar molecules or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even water themselves to probably very
beneficial effect of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the other interesting features
of a lot of these biosurfactants,
[SPEAKER_01]: including syringofactant, is that they're
very hygroscopic, that these various
[SPEAKER_01]: groups on the polar end are able to engage
in hydrogen bonding with water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes it very, very hygroscopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at high relative humidity,
these materials will bind large volumes of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several times their mass and water are
bound by these types of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we immediately thought of this as
something that would be very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: and very beneficial to a bacterium,
and we'd always thought of desiccation
[SPEAKER_01]: stress being perhaps one of the most
important stresses that microbes on a leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: would face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaves are dry in much of the time,
and they have to survive this periodic and
[SPEAKER_01]: prolonged desiccation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I mentioned these compatible solutes
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cells of all organisms experience low
water availability, they often accumulate
[SPEAKER_01]: these so-called compatible solutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: An among the compatible solutes is the
amino acid proline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more dry the cells would be,
the more proline they're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gwen Beatty developed a very nice
biosensor for water stress, if you would,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking advantage of the fact that we could
examine the expression of the puru,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the regulators of proline
biosynthesis linked to, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the green fluorescent protein reporter
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drier the cells, the higher the
expression of proline genes, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: greener the cells are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So introducing this reporter into a wild
type strain, but also a strain that was
[SPEAKER_01]: blocked in its ability to produce the
syringophactin, the biosophactin,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could then recover the cells after
different conditions on dry leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of these little dots is how green
the individual cells were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the greenness from left
to right, and the fractional cells exhibit
[SPEAKER_01]: that greenness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that as a whole,
the wild type strains are much less green
[SPEAKER_01]: than the mutant, which is unable to
accumulate the biosophactin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, these cells are drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does appear then that there is
sufficient biosophactin made by the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterium that they're essentially making
a small aqueous zone, if you would,
[SPEAKER_01]: around the bacteria by either attracting
the water in the form of vapor that would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably serve on the leaf surface,
a laminar layer of relatively humid air
[SPEAKER_01]: would surround a dry leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be attracted as liquid water
onto the surface of bacteria, or it might
[SPEAKER_01]: actually hold onto water when the leaf was
eventually intermentally wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, it does appear that it is
a very important survival factor for the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, because compared to the wild
type strain, mutants that were blocked
[SPEAKER_01]: into production of seringifactin,
and then exposed to four or five of these
[SPEAKER_01]: wet-dry patterns typical of a day-night
cycle, show that the mutant was much less
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of survival compared to the wild
type strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it looks like a very localized
wetting, if you would, of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seringifactin shown by the balls and
tails here are attracting enough water
[SPEAKER_01]: that the bacterium is going to benefit
from that wetter location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to finish by just a couple of
bigger issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything I talked about so far is
happening at a very small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world is a very big place to a very
tiny bacterium, and everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to that bacteria is probably
very localized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real question is, how do we get
the microbes on the leaves that we see on
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned before that when plants
first emerge into the world, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: usually almost devoid of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an image from one of my thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how long ago they're
showing that all these different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants growing in Wisconsin, there are
very, very few bacteria on the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: early, and the bacteria then accumulate
within a few days to a week or two to
[SPEAKER_01]: much, much higher levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprising, given that these all plants
were emerging through the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was lots of soil for an organism,
but in fact, they did not seem to colonize
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recently did a study where we
looked at microbes that we recovered from
[SPEAKER_01]: bean leaves and compared those to soil
organisms near the bean plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, and some rhizosphere microbes from
the same plants, and we put them through
[SPEAKER_01]: that typical stressful condition that a
plant would see, inoculated those leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates, for example, let them grow under
a wet leaf for a day, then let them dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: measure how many bacteria could grow up
and survive, then expose them to wet
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, to dry condition with UV light
and see how many could survive and again
[SPEAKER_01]: enumerate how many microbes we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then looked at what was the fate of
those cells compared to what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were wet, compared to what they
were after they went through this drying
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that leaf microbes,
if anything, often grew even during these
[SPEAKER_01]: wet conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between the wet and the dry
was actually a net increase in population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some just kind of held their population
and only a few were losers where they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually died and lowered populations
after they were wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You compare that with say the rhizosphere
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all of those decreased to
population size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They died by the time they got to the
condition that a cell would have seen in
[SPEAKER_01]: the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it appeared then that while many
microbes might live on a plant under these
[SPEAKER_01]: optimum conditions being wet, they do not
have the capability of surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be one of the conditions
that really typifies and epiphy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that we observed in our
early work with biological control
[SPEAKER_01]: actually was that there is probably a
limitation of the rate of immigration of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to leaves that dictates the
process of colonization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that only some microbes are
actually capable of growing on a plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to get those particular microbes
to a plant before the colonization process
[SPEAKER_01]: can start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look again at these
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember they were virtually sterile when
they emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you looked at flowers in the orchard
here, that the population size as a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: increased after the flowers opened only
fairly slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even after a couple of weeks,
the population sizes had still not reached
[SPEAKER_01]: very high numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we inoculated even just a few cells of
a good plant colonists like Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: florescens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that those populations increased
rapidly and the population sizes that
[SPEAKER_01]: these flowers could ultimately harbor are
about a million or so cells per flower was
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two orders of magnitude higher than
they typically did harbor at a given time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like those flowers were sitting
there saying colonize me, colonize me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they couldn't because the right
immigrants didn't make their way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower to enable that process to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of gives us some thought
pause about what is happening in the real
[SPEAKER_01]: world and how it will differ in a context
dependent way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back to this in a
minute, but basically this is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way many of the plants in the world now
come into being from seeds and huge fields
[SPEAKER_01]: with herbicide so that there's only in
this case little corn seedlings with who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows where any other kind of plant
colonists would ever make its way to these
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of plants compared to a more
diversified setting or even natural
[SPEAKER_01]: setting where you'd have a lot of
vegetation around at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new plant coming into this world is
potentially going to have a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably a much higher number of
potential immigrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, leaf surfaces and flowers are
what we would call an open microbiological
[SPEAKER_01]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to think of these flowers on
these apple trees where is the inactivity
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come from to colonize those?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they're not on the budge of the
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're certainly not in the flowers,
but in this setting, you see these cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop between these trees, these grasses in
California, they've been growing all
[SPEAKER_01]: winter long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had millions of bacteria on every
little leaf plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could easily move from this
vegetation nearby up into the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much, what role does emigration
play in this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been very interested in this
whole process of aerobiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this year of COVID, like we all
should be kind of interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's how many microbes are moving
around in tiny particles in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is that in human health or
in this case, what's the role of these
[SPEAKER_01]: particles in the air in terms of plant
colonization?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a simple experiment,
Berkeley right on the eastern edge of San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco Bay from our lab, where we look
out through the Golden Gate Bridge to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the air blows from the west almost all
the time towards Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hasn't seen a plant since the last
Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went down to the edge by vacuuming
air through our filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we vacuumed the air at the same
location, but about 30 meters in one,
[SPEAKER_01]: after the air passed over some vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at the numbers and
types of bacteria in the air by
[SPEAKER_01]: enumerating the DNA signatures of the
microbes that we collected on those
[SPEAKER_01]: filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was striking to me anyway,
that even after just a hundred feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you would, 30 meters inland from the
bay when the air first saw plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was around six to 10 times more
bacteria in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you looked at the types of
bacteria that we recovered on that air,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a whole group of different
bacterial taxa that you would typically
[SPEAKER_01]: find in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compare the upwind air with the
microbes we recovered on the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes that we found in the downwind
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that comparing this group
with this group, that the downwind air
[SPEAKER_01]: looks a lot more like the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the downwind air doesn't look very
much like the upwind air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that particular taxa like Pantoia,
which is a very prominent plant colonizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: is very abundant on plants, but also a
major factor in the downwind air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardly detectable in the upwind air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really looks like the air just being
infused by these plant colonists,
[SPEAKER_01]: like sphingomonas, same story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the plants are releasing bacteria
very efficiently into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air is basically now a mobile
reservoir of these inoculum that could
[SPEAKER_01]: move around and then those could then be
deposited on the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would then seem like if in fact
plants do vary in the types of microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that they do support, and that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beams here have different ones,
some grass and so on, that a given plant
[SPEAKER_01]: might have a very different type of a
microflora that would eventually develop
[SPEAKER_01]: on it as a function of what is the source
of inoculum for that inoculum that would
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the leaves to colonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took it down into the fact that my
brother has been a farmer in Oregon where
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, tall fescue, crimson clover
and wheat are some of his major crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows them in large homogeneous fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took a particular target plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I took tall fescue plants
that grow in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We transplanted them into the middle of
his tall fescue fields, his clover fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: his wheat fields, and then came back a few
weeks later to look at the communities
[SPEAKER_01]: that developed on that tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the plant itself was really the
driver of what ended up growing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves of the tall fescue, we would have
thought that the tall fescue would have
[SPEAKER_01]: had similar communities on it,
no matter what its local environment was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But PCL plot, as you see upper in the
upper right, you'll see that the
[SPEAKER_01]: communities on the grass plants are very
different from the ones in the clover and
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones in the wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was very, very different that there
were different types of microbes that
[SPEAKER_01]: could live on tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed then to be driven by what
was the first and most organisms that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be arriving at that tall fescue was
going to be the dominant colonizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can fit into what another group
looking at seaweeds in the ocean off of
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia came up with what they call the
competitive lottery bottle of community
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just read the bottom line from
their story showing that basically species
[SPEAKER_01]: with similar ecological properties are
able to occupy the same dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, a variety of microbes can live on
leaf surfaces, and the ones that would end
[SPEAKER_01]: up being there are going to be determined
by this stochastic recruitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stochastic recruitment to me says the
way we manage plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Management practices can have a huge
effect on the kind of communities we find
[SPEAKER_01]: on our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A practical implication of this has been
other work that we've been doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I won't show you all the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapes are a big deal in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapes are very specific to freezing
temperatures in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't enough water available to
protect the plants against the freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to show that the microbial
communities on the grapes in this left
[SPEAKER_01]: hand side of this large field where we had
removed the vegetation with herbicide were
[SPEAKER_01]: very different from the microbes in the
grapes when we allowed the cover crops to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, there's many fewer icemic
lighting than over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, simply by changing the local
microbiological context of those plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have a very big effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a large experiment a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cooperating grower let us use about an
80 hectare pear orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We divided it up into large numbers of
relatively large blocks where we plant a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular species of plants as cover
crops under them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a large randomized block,
just part of what you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came back and we measured two different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measured the amount of airborne
bacteria within a particular block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of these little blocks was about
three acres in size, and there was five
[SPEAKER_01]: replicas of each little block.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a number of bacterial cells
deposited per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought up large numbers of
undergraduates, and we all synchronized
[SPEAKER_01]: our watches and at the exact same time
opened them up for an hour in an area
[SPEAKER_01]: where there was different mixed weeds and
grasses compared to where we removed the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had plants that didn't support very
many bacteria as epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, just like we would have
shown from the aerosol measurements with
[SPEAKER_01]: our DNA devices, we see that there was
something like four or five times more
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in the areas where we had a lot
of these abundant sources of bacteria such
[SPEAKER_01]: as grasses growing under the trees
compared to the trees early on when there
[SPEAKER_01]: were not very many bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This in turn had a very measurable effect
on, in this case, fruit wrestling where
[SPEAKER_01]: these oxen producing bacteria were more
abundant early in the development of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because of their sources on these
other localized plants nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just finish by one simple cartoon
showing that the colonization of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: involves many processes, but these occur
at very different scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of who ends up on the plants,
which are a big part of the story,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a very large scale phenomenon
where emigration from one plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: emigration from another are tied
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are happening at very, very large
scales from many meters to maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes in a particular region are
going to differ, and that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the sources of an outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after they were to land on a plant,
it's all in a very, very small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria probably do not care what's
happening even a few millimeters away from
[SPEAKER_01]: each other on a leaf, and that everything
that's important to the process is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening at these very, very small
scales, and that the types of inoculum
[SPEAKER_01]: coming, how much interaction are happening
between the bacteria are happening at
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very small scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just finish by making a plug for what
a lot of people are very interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: these days, and that's kind of what I'm
going to call agricultural probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it kind of makes us sit back and
look at the way we do agriculture these
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw a picture of basically the large
naked cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a large naked soybean field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of the way we do ag anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large, large, large fields, long distances
from any other kind of natural vegetation
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be part of the normal process
by which colonization happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's probably inhibiting the
establishment of a quote normal microflora
[SPEAKER_01]: on these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the normal microflora is really
important in terms of competition with
[SPEAKER_01]: plant pathogens, that we're probably
making our plants somewhat more
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to disease kind of
inadvertently by having these effects on
[SPEAKER_01]: the community as itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is one of the reasons why
there's been the effects that we see from
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural probiotics, inoculating
seeds, springs, different things on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very often demonstrations where we
can improve plant growth, make them more
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to disease and all by changing
the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that effect is even more
pronounced and probably dictates the need
[SPEAKER_01]: for some way to intervene if we're going
to keep growing plants in this somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial way to kind of restore a normal
microbiology, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll stop there and just kind of
give acknowledgement to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of great work in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we can answer any questions if
you have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks so much, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for questions, we have time for maybe
one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that at 1.45, we have set
aside for a student postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lunch or meetup or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone has any questions and wants
to write them into the chat or unmute
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and ask, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a question from John who asks,
how might other leaf dwelling microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example fungi, affect or contribute to
the behaviors that you're describing for
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took out of my slides some pictures of
showing that bacteria may actually exploit
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria really don't penetrate leaves
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of dependent on this passive
diffusion of resources on the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very common if you do see fungi
growing on a leaf and many certainly plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic bacteria have fungi,
have the ability to invade the interior of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, bring resources up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungal hyphae are actually great
places to see bacterial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this mycosphere, if you would,
that microbes fungi bringing resources
[SPEAKER_01]: from the interior of the plant to the
surface where bacteria can exploit them
[SPEAKER_01]: directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got bacteria on plants,
but you also have bacteria on fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the nutrients from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several trophic levels that
can happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just read this one more
question that I'll read and then I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll sort of wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that most epiphytes
aggregate on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens when a new population
of pathogen lands there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they blend into the population,
navigate through it with nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, or do they have to fight and
sort of expel the local community to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish exclusive territory around
stomata?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably both of those things
happening, as you saw from the salmonella
[SPEAKER_01]: work, it's less likely that an immigrant
is going to survive at all if they land on
[SPEAKER_01]: a naked part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, that part of the leaf probably doesn't
have any resources for growth in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have this modification of local
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, if they're going to end up
among other organisms, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be successful competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be this probably intense
competition in many places where a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen would, in fact, land on a leaf if
they didn't themselves get a tumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with that, let's thank Steve
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the students or postdocs
interested in attending this next session,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can transition over to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
