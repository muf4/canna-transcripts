[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so I had the pleasure of taking
this leadership class that I think Marvin
[SPEAKER_13]: and family will be talking about today
last semester, so I am going to introduce
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of us probably already know Marvin
since he's been our department chair since
[SPEAKER_13]: 2002, but he didn't always start out,
oh, and he's researched interesting,
[SPEAKER_13]: completely sustainable berry crop
production.
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't always start out doing
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_13]: He first got his bachelor's, bachelor's
from Bucknell University in biology and
[SPEAKER_13]: then his master's from University of South
Carolina also in biology.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then finally when he went to Michigan
State University for his PhD he switched
[SPEAKER_13]: to horticulture.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those of you who know him a little bit
better probably know that he's a man of
[SPEAKER_13]: many interests and he loves to play
football and travel and play volleyball.
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a really great supply at his house.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he wants us with an alligator
which he might show us later.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if you take his leadership course
you find out even more about him.
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, that his Myers-Briggs
personality type is INTJ, which means
[SPEAKER_13]: introverted, intuitive thinking and
judging.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason he got interested in this
leadership course is because he realized
[SPEAKER_13]: there was a difference between what
Cornell said it was going to do,
[SPEAKER_13]: that it was going to prepare his graduate
students to be leaders in their
[SPEAKER_13]: communities, and what it actually offered
graduate students in terms of learning how
[SPEAKER_13]: to become leaders.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he decided to organize his class and he
called it the Big Guns.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where Pam comes in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pam is the president of the Cosmos Hill
Associates and also a senior human
[SPEAKER_13]: resource consultant in organizational
development here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_13]: She got her bachelor's from Harvard
University and then her master's at the
[SPEAKER_13]: New York State School of Industrial and
Labor Relations.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a really experienced human resources
consultant who's worked with a variety of
[SPEAKER_13]: private and public private businesses and
institutions that have ranged from local
[SPEAKER_13]: businesses like Moosewood Restaurant to
huge corporations such as Johnson &
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnson and Nestle Johnson Corporation and
Rubbermaid.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also to federal programs such as
USIRS and the Department of the Army.
[SPEAKER_13]: So two really impressive resumes and now
I'd like Mark and then Pam to continue to
talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real pleasure to be here today and
talk to you about leadership at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make the case that I think we
need more opportunities for leadership
[SPEAKER_09]: development, particularly amongst our
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second case is sometimes what we
think is leadership sometimes isn't
[SPEAKER_09]: really, that doesn't really meet the goal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to start off with an
uplifting article that came out this
[SPEAKER_09]: summer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the most widely read article ever
and it was most of your kids in the Ivy
[SPEAKER_09]: League how they should start college and
turn your kids into zombies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a large critique about Ivy
League education.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one piece of relevance I'm going
to pull out there is this particular piece
[SPEAKER_09]: here.
[SPEAKER_09]: One idea about Bob was communicated in the
speakers' schools of leadership.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard she has all the monitors.
[SPEAKER_09]: As for leaders though, I'm coming to say
that it's the high, people are urged to
[SPEAKER_09]: see themselves as future leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: What these institutions mean with
leadership is simply getting to the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it doesn't occur to people in
tribes or elite colleges that the concept
[SPEAKER_09]: of leadership ought to have a higher
meaning for really any community.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a pretty scathing critique of
what we teach at the Ivy League.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool if you want more critique you
can go ahead and read that article.
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things I thought we could
start off doing is think about what it
[SPEAKER_09]: means to be successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now people sometimes shy away from the
term leadership because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_09]: ever be a leader.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most people want to be successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And most people who end up in leadership
positions were judged to be successful at
[SPEAKER_09]: some point in their life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people have written a lot about what
it takes to be successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what we're going to do is spend a
few minutes, get into groups, and I want
[SPEAKER_09]: you to come up with a list of some things
that you think characterize successful
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll compare your list with what
people who study these things have on
[SPEAKER_09]: their list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just take a few minutes, you can
self-study, just get into groups,
[SPEAKER_09]: and just someone describe and make a list
of what characterizes successful leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see by the level of conversation
that you all have an abundance of ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start in the back with the rump
caucus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enthusiasm, organization, satisfaction
with life path, resilience, make the most
[SPEAKER_02]: of interpersonal relationships,
passionate about what you do but not
[SPEAKER_02]: insanely passionate, able to focus,
translate, share, humble, humility,
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge one's shortcomings,
and be okay with that, ability to listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to other perspectives, and create a voice
of taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite the list, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This group, what would you add to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't have to be this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like three points of bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is to be able to communicate properly
with your group as a leader, be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: set goals, because if you don't have a
goal, you don't know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last point we have is to be able
to be open-minded, always consider it
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody else's suggestion and not just
being narrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, our list is happy with who you are
and what you're doing and is passionate
[SPEAKER_11]: for it, being courageous, accomplishing
personal goals, being able to relate to
[SPEAKER_11]: people with communication skills,
having a positive influence on people and
[SPEAKER_11]: others in your group, and being able to
recognize the value of what it is that
[SPEAKER_11]: you're doing, creative problem solving,
and able to accept and adapt to change,
[SPEAKER_11]: being persistent while also understanding
your own limitations and external
[SPEAKER_11]: limitations, and being realistic about
that, and knowing your own strengths and
[SPEAKER_11]: limits.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, my group said they were to validate,
encouraging the team player to compromise
[SPEAKER_14]: humor, communication, empathy,
relatable, listening, hard-working,
[SPEAKER_14]: be clear by values, they have goals,
meet them, time management, willing to be
[SPEAKER_14]: wrong, and open to suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of the same ones,
but a couple of things that were not said
[SPEAKER_00]: so many times yet are mastery of a given
skill set, vision, and forethought being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to understand specific problems,
and then another thought was success
depends on how you define it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our group came up with empathy,
visionary, hard-working, inclusive,
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of decision-making, enthusiastic,
communication skills within the group and
[SPEAKER_01]: also outside, and even tempered,
and I realize we missed the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: point, which is humor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dima.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have anything on your list?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you covered a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a self-evaluation, the ability to
give and accept criticism, and attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a wonderful list.
[SPEAKER_09]: People write books on how to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I try to do is go through those and
glean out the top characteristics they say
[SPEAKER_09]: are part of being successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of people have one form or
another on the list.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've heard vision, ambition,
enthusiasm, working hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one said managing conflict.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an important part of being
successful.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of these others are communication
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear anybody mention the thing
that we spent almost 95% of our time
[SPEAKER_09]: doing, which is having specific knowledge
of skill.
[SPEAKER_09]: We spent a lot of our time teaching people
how to do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: The point I want to make, though,
is we spent most of our time teaching and
[SPEAKER_09]: working on that piece of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really ignore these others,
but we don't really deliberately focus on
[SPEAKER_09]: them and try to build expertise in some of
these other things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody is here innate.
[SPEAKER_09]: They come naturally to people,
but others can be improved upon and built
[SPEAKER_09]: upon.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I think we need to offer
opportunities for our students to build
[SPEAKER_09]: those skill sets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of the problem I think we have in our
community is this thing called science
[SPEAKER_09]: fundamentalism.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the definition that the only thing
that's important is science.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't do science, nothing else
really matters.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we sometimes feel that a lot or at
least hear that in some way.
[SPEAKER_09]: The question, when I ask, is there a place
in a research one university like Cornell
[SPEAKER_09]: for developing skill sets in addition to
scientific competence?
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You all listen.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these things are the key to success.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we make room for developing these skill
sets in our students?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we model those ourselves as faculty?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we teach those skills?
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the questions that I'm going to
grapple with today.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look across the university,
there are lots of opportunities for
[SPEAKER_09]: leadership programs for our students.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pam Hamilton, because she travels those
circles quite a bit, and we listed all
[SPEAKER_09]: these up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's missing from that list?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no real program directed for
scientists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the engineers, check it out,
this is important.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Maria mentioned in the introduction,
that was the genesis for trying to at
[SPEAKER_09]: least something, at least a course for
graduate students to help teach some of
[SPEAKER_09]: these additional skills.
[SPEAKER_09]: The course generally has 20 to 25 students
in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many graduate students are there in
college?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hundreds.
[SPEAKER_09]: The number one reason we hear why students
don't take that class is my major advisor
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't want me spending time outside in
the lab on these sort of classes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They consider it, well, not important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet, all of you just collectively
identify all of these traits and make
[SPEAKER_09]: people successful and make people good
leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet, those of us that are running in
faculty positions don't want our students
[SPEAKER_09]: doing these other things because they
should be in the lab and working on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's the real problem with
our culture here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we claim to develop leaders when we
don't provide our students with
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunities to develop skills for
success other than confidence in science?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if we can, but we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: CALS develops leadership ability,
civic responsibility, and curiosity in the
[SPEAKER_09]: students.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on the front page of the CALS
website.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we say we do, but I'm not sure if we
really do it justice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there are lots of courses at Cornell
that sort of get at leadership in one
[SPEAKER_09]: aspect or another.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a course inspiring leadership.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the goal of this is to expose you to
the habits, practices, skills,
[SPEAKER_09]: and mindset common to extraordinary
leaders through discussions, readings,
[SPEAKER_09]: exercises, films, and guest speakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds to me like a class where you go
and sit and typical things happen,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I'm not sure whether it actually
engages you in a significant leadership
[SPEAKER_09]: experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotel offers a program where they expose
you to meaningful leadership opportunities
[SPEAKER_09]: by interacting with hospitality leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So put students in a room with people that
are leaders and somehow magically make
[SPEAKER_09]: students become leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm saying this is bad, this is a good
thing to do, but I'm not sure if it's
[SPEAKER_09]: really comprehensive in this approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: The VET students, they have something too,
a leadership program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it's an intensive research-oriented
initiative.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I would argue that there's nothing
wrong with that, but I'm not really sure
[SPEAKER_09]: whether that really teaches leadership in
the sense that we should be focusing on a
[SPEAKER_09]: research initiative.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to be talking about other things
and other skills.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think too often our approach to
leadership training, even when we said we
[SPEAKER_09]: were going to do it, is on the posthumous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put people in a room with leaders and
they'll somehow become leaders themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: It often doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we often don't address the day-to-day
issues that must be dealt with by good
[SPEAKER_09]: leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's find out a vision and all that,
but it's the implementation that doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: make it great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And oftentimes the devil's in those
details.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't just be a big picture person
and ignore the details.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to kind of work above levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of business schools, that's kind of
a forte.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at almost every mission
statement of every business school in the
[SPEAKER_09]: country, it's going to say, you know,
we develop the leaders for the future and
[SPEAKER_09]: the CEOs and the business leaders and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one I just pulled out of
Chicago School of Business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since 1898, we've produced ideas and
leaders that shape the world of business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our rigorous, discipline-based approach to
business education transform our students
[SPEAKER_09]: into competent, effective, respected
business leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great mission statement.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope they do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another article that came out this summer
was five MBA programs that don't produce
[SPEAKER_09]: leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a critique of Chicago School of
Business and other programs like that that
[SPEAKER_09]: say we produce leaders, but they really
kind of miss a mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are the critiques that Drew
Hansen made in 1498.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, he said that leaders
understand people.
[SPEAKER_09]: MBAs, on the other hand, boil everything
down to numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to try to lead, just by
looking at the numbers and the metrics and
[SPEAKER_09]: so forth like that, you're never going to
succeed because behind those numbers and
[SPEAKER_09]: metrics are people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have ambitions and passions and
feelings and sensitivities.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you ignore that, you know, you ignore
it's your own peril.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Drew says a few skills are peddled
with the rest of the curriculum,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you get lost in all the hard analysis
and techniques.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one critique he makes of the
business schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: He makes three.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one is the leaders see the big
picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: In MBAs, unfortunately, you learn about
business in the three parts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, I've never been to business
school.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know whether that's a valid
critique or not, but he says it is that
[SPEAKER_09]: you learn about things in pieces,
but you don't really step back and look at
[SPEAKER_09]: how everything's connected.
[SPEAKER_09]: How one thing connects with another
connects to another.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they tend to put things in silence.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this isn't leadership.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the third critique he makes of
business schools is that strategic
[SPEAKER_09]: planning is essential.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to do it, but executing a
plan is what sets good companies apart
[SPEAKER_09]: from bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And schools teach strategic planning,
but they fail to teach how to execute
[SPEAKER_09]: because they do not understand how to
bring people together, to work in teams,
[SPEAKER_09]: to get people together.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one thing is strategic plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then how do you implement that and
make it happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: To do that, you've got to understand
people and how to build teams and how to
[SPEAKER_09]: carry things out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of times, people that are
leadership positions fail to pay attention
[SPEAKER_09]: to the details.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it fails.
[SPEAKER_09]: The project we're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Harvard Business Review.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus Buckingham says, those who toil in
the field of leadership development,
[SPEAKER_09]: the model works something like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can be the top performers, pick the
brains with the best techniques,
[SPEAKER_09]: codify those techniques into a formula,
and we have best practice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So once we discover it, turn it into a
formula, it's just a matter of bringing
[SPEAKER_09]: you in line with the formula.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what works.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be successful too.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he goes on to say, could it be
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_09]: Should leadership development instead be
tailored to individuals?
[SPEAKER_09]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's feasible to build a system that
delivers appropriately different training
[SPEAKER_09]: contexts to different types of leaders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So having said all that, and so the
background, what I felt several years ago
[SPEAKER_09]: was needed was a course about leadership
skills for emerging scientists to build
[SPEAKER_09]: confidence in people skills that will be
an important component of success after
[SPEAKER_09]: graduation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, a course that doesn't teach
leadership philosophosis, don't put people
[SPEAKER_09]: in a room with leaders and hope that it
rubs off.
[SPEAKER_09]: By doing and experiencing, a course that
recognizes that individuals have different
[SPEAKER_09]: strengths and that there are different
types of leadership needed for different
[SPEAKER_09]: types of situations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And understanding that successful academic
leadership may look different than
[SPEAKER_09]: successful leadership in other sorts of
organizations.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's why we probably don't take
a four-star general and bring him in to
[SPEAKER_09]: run Cornell.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a type of leadership that works
really well.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's different types that understand
that there isn't one size fits all
[SPEAKER_09]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's different types of leadership
styles and different types of
[SPEAKER_09]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we're about in our course
in LS 5100.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our philosophy is you learn by doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't learn by listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: You learn by doing and engaging in
activities that condition your brain to
[SPEAKER_09]: feel and experience what it might like in
certain different moments of life.
[SPEAKER_09]: The course is individualized.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are very different than Maria in
her introduction.
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you my admirer's degree is the
Timberland Index type.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm close to values the same as Pam's.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because we're scientists, I think that
way, a lot of people in the room are
[SPEAKER_09]: probably the same way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's important to realize the way you
are and the way you see things because
[SPEAKER_09]: there's only 1% of the population that are
like us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like some of you, 1%.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are other types that are 10% of
the population that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it makes a real difference whenever
we're working with other people to
[SPEAKER_09]: understand why we are the way we are and
why other people are the way they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I mean by individualized.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're textual, I just sort of
mentioned that leadership in one context,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether you're leading GM or leading the
military or leading a university or your
[SPEAKER_09]: department or a section, is very different
depending on what the context is and the
[SPEAKER_09]: type of relationships and decision making
you have with any organization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's intensely personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: The stories and things that are shared to
really be meaningful, they don't come out
[SPEAKER_09]: of the textbook.
[SPEAKER_09]: They come from individuals sharing very
personal experiences with each other and
[SPEAKER_09]: how they felt, how they reacted in those
situations and critiquing what they could
[SPEAKER_09]: have done differently, what went well,
what didn't go well, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a lot of the conversations that
happen in that class stay within that
[SPEAKER_09]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria said, what you learned about in that
class, I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: So our course has a syllabus.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 10 weeks long.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts in the winter semester.
[SPEAKER_09]: It ends by spring break.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do these 10 different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to just talk about a few of
those and talk about the others.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first week we talk about what
leadership is and what does it mean to be
[SPEAKER_09]: a leader, somewhat of that period that
you're engaged in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we would have had time, we'd always
kind of like put a little twist in things.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we might have done is picked a group
of leaders ahead of time and told one of
[SPEAKER_09]: the group leaders, I want you to be very
opinionated and not listen to what anybody
[SPEAKER_09]: else says.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell the other people in your group
that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But another person would be really bushy
and not have any opinion in the group.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the third person might say,
oh, we don't want to say anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might offend the administration,
so let's not say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So while you're engaged in this exercise,
these people behave in a certain way and
[SPEAKER_09]: your formula is opinion about them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you talk about the result,
you get the information, but you also
[SPEAKER_09]: think, how did you think about how such
and how Maria did as a leader?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you think, well, she wasn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: How did you feel about that when the
person went to take charge and listened to
[SPEAKER_09]: you and so forth?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of brings that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the sorts of things we do in
this class.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked already a little about personal
style on leadership using the Myers-Briggs
[SPEAKER_09]: Temperament Index.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was originally developed during World
War II.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all the men went off to war.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were all these jobs that needed
to be done here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only people left to do them were
women.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the women hadn't received any kind
of training.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were housewives.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there were these opportunities to
do work, and they were needed to do work
[SPEAKER_09]: for the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you didn't just want to pick somebody
up and say, oh, you're going to work in
[SPEAKER_09]: the steel mill, and you're going to work
in the library.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to do this and that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So based on our notes where they developed
this personality and temperament index,
[SPEAKER_09]: you take this test, and it can tell you
what career, what sort of types of work
[SPEAKER_09]: really fit your personality well.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are they successful?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are they successful?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still used to this day.
[SPEAKER_09]: More than 1,000 PhD thesis have been
written on the Myers-Briggs Temperament
[SPEAKER_09]: Index.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people here have done
Myers-Briggs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably about 1.5.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it really useful and insightful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do that with the students.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talk about the whole implications
of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also do something called strength
findings.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another way to understand yourself
that was developed by Gallup and those
[SPEAKER_09]: folks that identify 34 strengths that
people have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for you, you answer a bunch of
questions so far, and that identifies your
[SPEAKER_09]: top five strengths.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what you're good at and play
your strengths.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a big part of leadership is
understanding yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_09]: Understand yourself, know where you're
strong, where you're weak, so you can kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of compensate for those weaknesses and
knowing your strengths.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do that for the first three weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last thing we do on the part
about understanding yourself is how do you
[SPEAKER_09]: present yourself in the outside world?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we know that one of the first things
that happens when you apply for a job is
[SPEAKER_09]: that the employer, potential employer,
goes on Facebook to see what kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: person you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people here in the admissions
office.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have people who go on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: A prospective student has been judged
based on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, one of the things about Facebook,
if you hang out with some shady characters
[SPEAKER_09]: like I do, you don't have the control over
what they post on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to give the folks looking about
me something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give it to them so they don't
search around.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to print up something really easy
so they can understand who I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that we do in the
class is we ask the students to develop
[SPEAKER_09]: electronic portfolios so it captures what
they're about so they can send a link to
[SPEAKER_09]: their electronic portfolio to the
potential employer so they can look at
[SPEAKER_09]: your portfolio and learn about them that
way instead of like fishing around in all
[SPEAKER_09]: those dark corners trying to find out
what's out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to show you Maria's electronic
portfolio.
So much for what happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got her permission.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, there are tabs across the party
and each of the tabs says something about
[SPEAKER_09]: me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want more detail on her resume
anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've heard Maria, she has a little bit
here on her research project and put in
[SPEAKER_09]: some pictures and linked her resume,
a poster that she did.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really nice to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: In class, she did some reflections on
leadership and what it means to be a
[SPEAKER_09]: leader.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did an essay on Rachel Carlson and how
that influenced her personally.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can put all that on your electronic
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_09]: Teaching and learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace Corps and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a little bit about her own interests
and things that you might not know about
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's on a swim team.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been on a marathon and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just those little tabs there tell you a
whole lot I think about Maria that we
[SPEAKER_09]: wouldn't have gotten from her resume.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we want our students to do that and
put that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did one for myself because I think it's
great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put up a page about me, a little bit about
my research, pictures and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Teaching experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some links to other websites.
[SPEAKER_09]: My own reflections on leadership.
[SPEAKER_09]: Transformative experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've done that a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, okay, since you said my special
talents and skill sets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the work I do in Guatemala,
I put there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the trips I've done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think down here is my alligator rusting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're really great, those electronic
portfolios.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have students do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then, after that fourth week,
they learn about themselves and they put
[SPEAKER_09]: that out there for the world to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, from there on, we go into some other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in this class generally are from
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're gonna go back out to
organizations that are all over the world
[SPEAKER_03]: or touch clients or parts of the world
that are different than them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we spend a lot of time talking about
cultural fluency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the context work that we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leadership is contextual and it's
important to understand the norms of
[SPEAKER_03]: different cultures before you insert
yourself into the culture using Western
[SPEAKER_03]: norms and fail utterly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we do some experiential work
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People share stories about things that
have been particularly interesting or
[SPEAKER_03]: jarring in other cultures, even as people
come to this culture and experiencing odd
[SPEAKER_03]: things here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's usually very funny and very
interesting and stimulates more
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation about how it is to work in a
different and diverse workplace than I
[SPEAKER_03]: ever hear in any formal seminar on the
subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think it's really applicable
broadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we really talk about how you think
about including different opinions,
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds of culture, different
backgrounds, different scientific training
[SPEAKER_03]: into your leadership practice and spend
time doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get into simulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We built a simulation that makes the
participants actually become members of an
[SPEAKER_03]: organization in some roles and goals,
things they have to do, some timetables
[SPEAKER_03]: they have to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we let them go, for better or worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things happen, people are encouraged to
reflect upon what happened, to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: how they felt about what happened,
what surprised them about it, talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: the experiences, what might be done
differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's a lot of fun, but there's a
lot of applied trying the things on
[SPEAKER_03]: precise, trying things on precise that
people have already learned from each
[SPEAKER_03]: other and from the things that we've
talked about earlier and trying to make a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference in the actual simulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we talk about how to motivate,
which seems like it's an obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend a lot of time with corporate
leaders who have assumptions that are
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly outdated and based on no science
whatsoever about how you actually motivate
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can bring to bear all the
different cultures that we're working in
[SPEAKER_03]: and how motivation really differs across
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also talk about what science really
does know and think about how to try it on
[SPEAKER_03]: your size in both the context of graduate
work that you're doing, graduate
[SPEAKER_03]: organization that you might be in and
organizations where you're actually doing
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a TA shift, student organization or
summer job or ultimately going out and
[SPEAKER_03]: working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we talk about conflict, which is,
of course, for those of you who want to
[SPEAKER_03]: know me, one of my favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not be in conflict, but because it's an
opportunity really to change things for
[SPEAKER_03]: the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get unhappy, they complain.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they complain, it's an opportunity to
understand, and that's how we think about
[SPEAKER_03]: leadership generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: When things blow up, it's a time to think
about what it is we are missing,
[SPEAKER_03]: what we can be doing better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do some role plays with that,
we go through cases about that,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we work with protocols and things that
actually work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the fun will actually
encourage people to go out and try it on
[SPEAKER_03]: your size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not starting conflicts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figuring out some ways to make situations
that you're part of work better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, the evaluation that we do
with the program is actually built by the
[SPEAKER_03]: students in the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how you think about what it is you
should be learning and how you really get
[SPEAKER_03]: the students to share whether or not
they've learned it is a difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are asked at the end of the class
to fill out a sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can often leave things open to
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they really get to share all the things
that they wish they shared about the class
[SPEAKER_03]: and how it impacted them, or do they not?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a full class where we really
spend it on how do you know if you've
[SPEAKER_03]: become successful?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know if the class worked to do
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the students design the questions,
and then we work them through an answering
[SPEAKER_03]: of the questions and analyze the answer to
the questions process right there in that
[SPEAKER_03]: classroom setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our classes are three hours long,
so it gives us a lot of opportunities to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the syllabus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any question on that before we put you
into exercise?
No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you kept track of the graduates and
where they have ended up since you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some of them are now my Facebook
friends, if you've ever thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many are with us on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret may have some more formal links.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I hear from many of the students
myself in email as they travel throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the world doing the great things that they
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess to answer your question,
we do not have a formal way of collecting
[SPEAKER_09]: information on what these students do.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're lucky if we can do that in our own
department section, and we have students
[SPEAKER_09]: that come from all over the campus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really hard to keep track of them
unless they voluntarily let us know what
[SPEAKER_09]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't really have a way of comparing
that group with it, simply because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: made a real difference in their success.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say, because I've had people
tell me that even though they may not ever
[SPEAKER_09]: go into a scientific career, they feel
that what they've learned in this class is
[SPEAKER_09]: going to help them be a better person,
help them with their families,
[SPEAKER_09]: help them with their friends, and all
sorts of relationships they have
[SPEAKER_09]: throughout their life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this course essentially is
understanding people and what makes people
[SPEAKER_09]: take it and how they operate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though they don't become some
famous scientist or CEO, hopefully it will
[SPEAKER_09]: help them become a better person in their
relationships with others.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which departments have contributed the
most participants to this class?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you think you have the best
buy-in, or where do you think you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: make more inroads?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think probably the worst buy-in are
plant scientists, and I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's hard sell for plant scientists.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the reason I mentioned earlier,
you should be working in your lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had really good buy-in from food
science.
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost every year we've got food
scientists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Natural resources have been really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to study students that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had students from all over Cal's,
actually, and increasingly from
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a student from the business school
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of an indication that it's
interesting when the scientists are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: more about managing than the school for
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have had students that,
we define life science in a very broad
[SPEAKER_09]: sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, doing anything involves people,
in a sense, with a scientific approach to
[SPEAKER_09]: life science.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have been getting quite a few
students from, say, development sociology,
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as one or two from ADM.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really, one of the things that
makes it really fun is that the students
[SPEAKER_09]: come from all over.
[SPEAKER_09]: And their experiences, like, if you want
to talk about bad examples, that's great.
You've got a really good pool of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've ever seen this happen in life,
there's all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of stories.
[SPEAKER_09]: If everyone were from plant sciences,
we wouldn't have that many stories.
[SPEAKER_09]: But because of them all over the place,
that's been good.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would like to see more plant
scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I participated with Cal's focus groups for
the strategic planning process that you
[SPEAKER_03]: all would have realized here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things we heard from
graduate students in these groups is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they are routinely exploring leadership
training where they can find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often, it's a don't ask, don't tell
proposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't tell their advisors that
they're pursuing it for fear they'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: a discussion about maybe the time could be
differently spent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with no malfeasance on the part of the
people who are guiding them, it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: that they have a lot to do and a short
time to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually funded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the students were very mindful of that,
but craving these kinds of experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get a lot of feedback about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were actually some people who
did theory class who were in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a lot of cross-litizing for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to say a word.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't formulated this really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I think about my own experiences
learning to work with people and organize
[SPEAKER_12]: with groups and things like that,
many of the most where I've learned the
[SPEAKER_12]: most has been actually trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So working in community groups and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm just wondering how you think
that might be better incorporated into a
[SPEAKER_12]: graduate education opportunities to do
authentic work in groups and reflect on it
[SPEAKER_12]: in community with other students?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's students who come to Ithaca
have to get their feet wet in how it is to
[SPEAKER_03]: wear a winter coat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to learn the local culture,
learn the kind of opportunities there are
[SPEAKER_03]: not just to be in graduate student
organizations or clubs, but to be involved
[SPEAKER_03]: where they live.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doing other volunteer work or
non-graduate work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them do and some of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have any guidance for
how this should work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin, have you thought about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think for the same reason that
students feel like they don't have time to
[SPEAKER_09]: take class, they also don't have time to
get heavily involved in the community room
[SPEAKER_09]: or other certain activities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we can force that change,
but I think what we can do as professors
[SPEAKER_09]: is we can model that behavior and show how
you can also be an excellent scientist,
[SPEAKER_09]: but also be involved in a community group
or two and do things outside of the
[SPEAKER_09]: classroom and invite students into that
community to participate in these
[SPEAKER_09]: subjects.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think being involved on it is important.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of a little bit of a door for
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of related to the earlier question.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, there's this thing called
engaged learning at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Primarily, I think, targeting
undergraduates, but there's also engaged
[SPEAKER_08]: research, which would be appropriate for
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it raises the question for me,
is this restricted to grad students or
[SPEAKER_08]: would it be open for upper level
undergrads?
[SPEAKER_08]: For that matter, if engaged Cornell is
going to succeed and we're going to have
[SPEAKER_08]: students out there in communities during
the summer or otherwise engaging with real
[SPEAKER_08]: organizations, real communities,
CSB Cornell is going to need a suite of
[SPEAKER_08]: courses like this that all students may be
required to do before they go out there in
[SPEAKER_08]: the field.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So our class has between 20 and 25,
and that's ideal for this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we open it up, I wouldn't necessarily
want more than that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could take probably 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also think that we did have one
undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a good contributor, but the life
experience was very different for her than
[SPEAKER_09]: it was for graduate students.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria spent a couple years overseas in the
Peace Corps.
[SPEAKER_09]: She just had a life experience that was
quite a bit more rich than the other
[SPEAKER_09]: graduates.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that, yeah, absolutely,
courses for undergraduates would be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know if we can mix them in the
same classroom and have the same result.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cal's has an undergraduate leadership
class that's been going now for the third
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was so popular that I think
they're now running two sections on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Marvin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Kristen Smart.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering if you guys talk about
diversity in leadership.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that in academia, that's one thing
that we're frequently looking for.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm wondering if there's any way to
include that in the leadership experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about it an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to challenge assumptions that are
made about how to do this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we try to really talk fairly openly
and honestly about what we know to be
[SPEAKER_03]: going on, some of the pitfalls of doing
this kind of work, and how to be thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about it in five or six different ways,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be a hair assessment?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would say it's first and foremost
on our minds as we go through all of
[SPEAKER_09]: these.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's appreciation of diversity and how
to handle diversity, how to manage it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and work with it to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not think of it as a detriment,
but think of it as there's a person with a
[SPEAKER_09]: different perspective, a different skill
set, and won't that really help our
[SPEAKER_09]: industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that answer the question?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Kristen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam, in your research, what do employers,
leaders, point out as the chief motivators
[SPEAKER_05]: for the employees with whom they work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hilariously, as I continue to give
this pushback, corporations, in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular, tend to rely on things that
can be a more one-size-fits-all approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have performance-based pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a popular approach to motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The assumption is, particularly after the
economic downturn, that if you have a job,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should be motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're willing to give you a pay
increase based on some way that we assess
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've done, then you should be more
motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be more reinforced.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the research literature really doesn't
support that, except in a few very
[SPEAKER_03]: specific, very contained cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we sort of take apart the popularness
about leadership, whether it's motivation
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything else, and talk about what kind
of research is there, actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what can we work with, especially as
we're looking at importing non-Western
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking into how we do leadership.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all about working in the US with
Western-based ways of doing business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what other motivators are there that
are the most successful, particularly in a
[SPEAKER_05]: non-corporate setting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think you've heard some of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, we asked people to talk
about characteristics, the notion of being
[SPEAKER_03]: passionate about what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going to be passionate about
what you do, you have to be given some
[SPEAKER_03]: autonomy to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some freedom to be able to do the work
that you're tasked to do within certain
[SPEAKER_03]: boundaries, to be able to add something of
yourself to that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, is really to be able to be a
lifelong learner, that you can't just be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the same thing day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to explore and add to
your skill set and feel like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interning more in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are two really big things that
people need to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need, often, to be able to be
recognized as being a valued member of a
[SPEAKER_03]: team, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we often see, and when I talk to
people in the corporate world,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also not in the nonprofit world,
is this notion that what people really
[SPEAKER_03]: want is more pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I give a person more pay or promise
to give them more pay, they're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: more work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any data to back
that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there's slim data, again, in very
finite cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you say to a person that you bring
meaning, you bring skills, you bring
[SPEAKER_03]: competencies we don't have, here's what we
trust you to do, here's what we,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how can you help us do it
better?
[SPEAKER_03]: People tend to open up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we focus on is, if you're thinking
about leadership in working groups,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not taking a person as a finite
contribution in a widget, plugging them in
[SPEAKER_03]: and sort of lashing them over the head
with things like pay and a nice desk chair
[SPEAKER_03]: to make them work hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about optimizing what people
bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see people bring more of
themselves to the work because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: glad to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're getting something out of
it even as they're adding something to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really different way of looking
at it for most businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I can say, too, that's one thing
I sort of fault point out for.
[SPEAKER_09]: We spend the morning all the time on
performance dialogues and then grading
[SPEAKER_09]: people and figuring out how much they're
going to make.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's always around 2% and you parse
out half a percent.
