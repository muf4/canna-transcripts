[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Alton Thompson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the executive director of the
Association of Research Directors for the
[SPEAKER_02]: 1890 land grant universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great to be on the panel with my
colleagues, Ramon Shange and Ali Fares.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The title of my presentation is the
Climate Change and Environmental Justice,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ensuring Resilience for Underserved
Communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really based on a multi-state,
1890 multi-state climate project that both
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramon and Ali are members of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm having some computer issues,
so Jennifer's going to advance my slides
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of a presentation outline
briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the climate crisis
relative to underserved communities,
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental justice relative to justice
40, which is a whole of government
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative, a little bit about the
multi-state climate project, lived
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, which is an important part of
our project, alignment with the national
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change roadmap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just show you that screen just as
reference and context, not to go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit about environmental justice,
resiliency for underserved communities,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then some multi-state findings and
then our call for action.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go over all the slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are just a reference,
but then we sort of move as accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, Jennifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, my focus is on really a
thesis in three themes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thesis is this decade is crucial for
understanding climate change and the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate crisis, and the themes are the
importance of science-based, data-driven,
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture practices and policies of
climate science, diversity, equity,
[SPEAKER_02]: and inclusion, the relevance of
environmental justice to underserved
[SPEAKER_02]: communities, and building resilience in
underserved communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the climate change in general,
the Biden-Harris administration has
[SPEAKER_02]: described climate change as an existential
threat with issues in environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: justice, agriculture, transportation,
energy, economic development, and
[SPEAKER_02]: prosperity.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we look at terms of being an
existential threat, climate change has
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly became a focus of Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has become a focus of the
administration, industry, stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of climate change in general,
recent severe weather events has caused
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive damage globally, particularly in
1923.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in 1923, the United States
experienced almost $93 billion in weather
[SPEAKER_02]: and climate disasters, the highest on
record.
[SPEAKER_02]: These included 17 severe weather and hail
events, four flooding events, two tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: cyclones, two tornado outbreaks,
one wildfire, one winter storm,
[SPEAKER_02]: several major droughts, several heat waves
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Phoenix, Arizona, July was the hottest
month on record with an average of 103
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Valley in California had a daily
average on July 16 of 128 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a record number of tornadoes in
2023, which caused about $6 billion in
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this information comes from NOAA,
National Oceanic Atmospheric
[SPEAKER_02]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm speaking, my home state of North
Carolina, particularly the western part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the state, areas of South Carolina and
Georgia are still recovering from
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurricane Helene.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm speaking now, Hurricane Milton will
be making landfall on the Florida coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere between south of Sarasota and by
nightfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The climate crisis is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just some examples of how the
effect it is having.
[SPEAKER_02]: The climate crisis calls for urgent,
large-scale mitigation and adaption
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts for future damages and build
resilience against its unavoidable
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, particularly focused on the second
bullet, third bullet, and the fourth
[SPEAKER_02]: bullet, agriculture is really based on
climate change, particularly ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really needs to be based on
science-based, data-driven practices and
[SPEAKER_02]: policies that lower such things as
greenhouse gas emissions, carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: sequestration, resilience in our food,
agriculture, and forest systems against
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts of climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: The focus of this project is really for
the 1890 universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funded through our research program
addressing a broad range of climate change
[SPEAKER_02]: and mitigation issues in the 1890 region,
which is really 18 southern and border
[SPEAKER_02]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the Biden administration,
again, is a focus of identifying racial
[SPEAKER_02]: equity and addressing climate change as
immediate priorities as going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Justice Fort initiative is one
of the requirements of Executive Order
[SPEAKER_02]: 14008, which aims to deliver 40% of all
overall benefits of federal investments in
[SPEAKER_02]: climate and clean energy should be
earmarked towards disadvantaged
[SPEAKER_02]: communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really is a call for action in terms
of racial equity and addressing climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a call for action for the
Biden administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the 1918-1980 universities are in a
unique position to contribute to these
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions because we have the academic
credentials, we have the academic
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, and also, which I will discuss
a little later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposal we were working on that Ali
and Ramon are working on is really focused
[SPEAKER_02]: on looking at climate impacts and its
consequences on persons in low-income,
[SPEAKER_02]: underserved, and marginalized communities
and communities of color.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first developed this project,
we did a literature review, and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: a gap in the literature on how climate
change affects this clientele.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate change is place-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in the Florida area,
in the southeast area, pretty much prone
[SPEAKER_02]: to hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Midwest, it's mostly tornadoes and
wind storms.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the West, of course, it's earthquakes
and wildfires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is a multistate,
multidisciplinary proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, 1989s are unique because we are in
a position because of our experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, climate change is not a flavor of
the month.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working with this audience for
over 130 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a unique opportunity to employ our
current capacity as well as invest in new
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity as well as we go forward in this
effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, look at Bullet 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an integrated project for both
research, extension, and academics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of this slide, the lived
experience, which is part of this project,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a well-written peer-reviewed
article that appeared in the journal
[SPEAKER_02]: Community Engagement and Scholarship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really talks about how the 1890s should
be engaged using transdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches and systems approach,
and also talking about the lived
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read that article later.
[SPEAKER_02]: The methodology part of this proposal is
looking at the lived experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lived experience is essentially a
systematic approach to use, to study,
[SPEAKER_02]: understand individuals' personal,
subjective lived experiences and
[SPEAKER_02]: interpretation for their own lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: The methodology is commonly used in
qualitative research of phenomenology to
[SPEAKER_02]: explore how people proceed, make sense of,
and narrate their experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, that is, to view the world
through the eyes of the stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand that from their perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: This ethnographic approach involves deep,
intensive interviews to engage citizens
[SPEAKER_02]: who have experience interacting with
persons they trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're going to work with the
Extension Service and Ramon to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: persons that we need to participate in the
study, basically assess the feelings and
[SPEAKER_02]: emotions about the experience related to
climate change, their perceptions of the
[SPEAKER_02]: threats or the risks that climate change
may cause them, and also determining the
[SPEAKER_02]: readiness of underserved communities with
uncertainty of climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the lived experience is important
because we've been working, 189 has been
[SPEAKER_02]: working with this audience, low-income,
limited resource, small producers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and communities of color for over 130
years, and the 189 Extension program is
[SPEAKER_02]: well-equipped to help identify persons to
interview in this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the lived experience of the
researchers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the lived experience give us a deep
understanding of how individuals navigate
[SPEAKER_02]: their worlds, how to make decisions,
and how they're affected by various
[SPEAKER_02]: factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will really give us a rich,
unique data set as we go about looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: the impact of climate change in low-income
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's a safe space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the third one is key is trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned to Arlene and Shaggy
earlier, I'm at an AI conference in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pittsburgh, and they're still talking
about trust is also an important variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we want to pick, as we collect
our data, use extension agents whom they
[SPEAKER_02]: trust to take a non-probability sample of
farmers and community residents,
[SPEAKER_02]: to collect the primary data for this
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Briefly, these are the goals of the
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four goals for this multi-state
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal one is soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal two is about water security,
which Arlene Forrest is one of the leads
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal three is dealing with environmental
justice and climate equity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal four is the policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Briefly, these are the goals of the
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how all 19 institutions are
participating in this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But environmental justice, as we define
it, refers to the fair treatment and
[SPEAKER_02]: meaningful environment of our people,
regardless of race, color, national
[SPEAKER_02]: origin, or income.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also talks about relative environmental
laws, policies, and decision-making
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goals that no group, especially
historically marginalized or underserved
[SPEAKER_02]: communities disproportionately bears the
burden of environmental hazards or not
[SPEAKER_02]: access to environmental benefits,
such as clean air, water, and healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really we're looking at disproportionate
impacts, access to resources, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: impact of climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the national climate roadmap.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the framework for future
investment in climate science research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to use a reference because even
though the multi-state project started
[SPEAKER_02]: before this roadmap was finished,
our project aligns very well with the
[SPEAKER_02]: seven themes and the nine principles of
this roadmap.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1890 Sanders was also involved in this
roadmap.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the seven themes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's particular for this project
is participatory research process and also
[SPEAKER_02]: socioeconomic and policy-based analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to show you this as a guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next slide deals with the guiding
principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Equity and justice is one of the guiding
principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the focus of this presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of these nine guiding principles
are inherent in our multi-state project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: This just shows the overlap of the guiding
principles of the national climate change
[SPEAKER_02]: roadmap with our project itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, one of the project was funded
by USDA NIFA, the AFRIC program.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a project on environmental
justice area and only one project was
[SPEAKER_02]: funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The project was awarded to North Carolina
AT State University to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental justice for low-income
communities and communities of color.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kathleen Liang is one of the PIs on
our project as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, what Kathleen wanted to do is
basically understand how equity and
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution of both research investments
and science outcomes in the four AFRIC
[SPEAKER_02]: priority areas, especially using a graphic
probability model to look at statistics
[SPEAKER_02]: interface with GIS to look at how the
research are being invested in limited
[SPEAKER_02]: resource communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alton, just to jump in that we're hoping
to get onto the next speaker fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at this slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to skip to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some selected findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one Southern University.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first bullet is they did look at two
parks, one frequently by
[SPEAKER_02]: African-Americans, one frequently by
Caucasians.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that in all three bullets in terms
of the tree cover, the canopy cover,
[SPEAKER_02]: the carbon storage, the carbon storage per
year per acre, as well as the oxygen per
[SPEAKER_02]: term per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a two sigma difference in the
African-American communities and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Caucasian communities in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get about the next four or five
slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, Jennifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I conclude is one of the things to
ensure resilience in our communities is to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at infrastructure development,
to look at financial tools and insurance,
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at education and capacity
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: To look at our community-led adaptations,
access to climate information,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as sustainable agricultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you really ensure resilience in
our low-income communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of the presentation,
but essentially, as I conclude,
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change is really an urgent issue
that proportionally affects underserved
[SPEAKER_02]: communities who are often more vulnerable
and least equipped to adapt to impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, as I mentioned, by taking these
actions, we ensure that the fight against
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change is just and inclusive
leaving no communities behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Addressing climate inequity is not only a
matter of justice, but also essential for
[SPEAKER_02]: a sustainable, resilient future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Alton.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a very comprehensive overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing that some people on the call
like me until I saw your first
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation some months ago had no idea
about the breadth and scope of work that
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some compliments in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not yet see any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one quick one for you then,
and then we'll move on while we're
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you emphasized a lot
about trust in your relationships within
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1890 region with who you work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's I think
particularly interesting for climate work
[SPEAKER_01]: is a tendency for people of color to care
more about climate on the one hand than
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking at national polling than the
average American, and yet on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: hand for rural people to be more
conservative about this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if you have any just kind of
comments on how you talk about climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change with your audiences and how you
kind of approach the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have trouble in some of our
states figuring out how to gain entry into
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation even around this topic,
so how about with the people you work with
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: The key thing in 1890 is the extension
agents are really trusted per person in
[SPEAKER_02]: the community, but also when we do climate
change we're not talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're sort of taking climate change,
looking at its computer part and its
[SPEAKER_02]: component parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may talk about the excessive heat,
we may talk about heat, we may talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: wind storms, we may talk about flooding,
we may talk about drought, we may talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about have your crop rotation changed in
it so we're going to sort of break it down
[SPEAKER_02]: into component parts such that you know
also as we collect these data we're also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to say now when we collect the data
we're going to give you the results back
[SPEAKER_02]: to help you improve your operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll get something in return for it
and really then trust them with the
[SPEAKER_02]: confidentiality and anonymity pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get something back when we ask them
some specific questions about how to
[SPEAKER_02]: affect their lives specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the interest of hearing from
our two other presenters we'll move along
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right thank you David.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Dr. Thompson, Dr. Barron for
sharing the space with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope I live up to your great work
that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here in particular to share what 1890
Extension is doing in the space of climate
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we're addressing climate
challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Raymond Shonday, Extension
Administrator at Tuskegee University as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as Vice Chair for Association
Extension Administrators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick overview of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go into a little bit of context and
background of why 1890 Extension impacts,
[SPEAKER_03]: how it impacts climate resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then talk a little bit about national
climate extension organizing about climate
[SPEAKER_03]: and how that is presenting in the 1890s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll talk a little more particulars
about our first convening in 1890
[SPEAKER_03]: Extension regarding climate and how we
interface as researchers as Dr. Thompson
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right so I'm not going to go too much
in these first slides are going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of maps, few graphs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say if you want to go more into
some of these graphics they are published
[SPEAKER_03]: on a website of the Harvard Integrated
Sustainability Center which is the center
[SPEAKER_03]: excellence at Tuskegee University.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first issue of Black Belt which is one
of our publications looks into the
[SPEAKER_03]: historic Black Belt counties and as you
can see that's where our primarily our
[SPEAKER_03]: 1890 institutions lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any one of our colleagues from
Central State please forgive me for using
[SPEAKER_03]: this outdated map.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have colleagues now in Central State
and Ohio as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 19 institutions, 18 states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very lucky in Alabama to have two
1890s Alabama A&M at Tuskegee University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is this work so important to the
communities that we work in?
[SPEAKER_03]: The communities that we work in are
economically depressed and challenged in
[SPEAKER_03]: other ways that include other social
indices.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to show here the distressed
counties not just in which the
[SPEAKER_03]: institutions are located but in the
counties that each of the extension
[SPEAKER_03]: programs work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rank anywhere this is only 10 of the
19 but I just wanted to choose these 10 to
[SPEAKER_03]: show that range from 100 percent of the
counties to 53 percent of the counties
[SPEAKER_03]: that we serve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the people do need and continuously
support the extension work in those
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's another map about changes in
energy expenditures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that the southeast and
southwest is projected to be heavily
[SPEAKER_03]: impacted.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you overlay that on the fact that most
of these communities are economically
[SPEAKER_03]: distressed you see that we're headed for
not only climate disaster but other social
[SPEAKER_03]: and economic disaster in this community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also and again this will be in
actually this year's upcoming publication
[SPEAKER_03]: in the State of African American Black
Belt where one of our researchers gets a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit deeper into some of these
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also energy burdens and
projected extreme heat waves that are in
[SPEAKER_03]: the communities that we work in in 1890.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you that are familiar with
extension you understand that a lot of our
[SPEAKER_03]: work that lies ahead is not just in
agricultural natural resources but also in
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumer sciences, youth development
as well as community economic development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a little bit of context as to
why the work is so important that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: taking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say one of the I guess movements
or events that really kind of struck a
[SPEAKER_03]: nerve with some of our colleagues in the
community was the organizing that ECOP,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Extension Committee on Organization of
Policy and the Climate Program Master
[SPEAKER_03]: Team, some of the actions that they began
to take around organizing around climate
[SPEAKER_03]: change was very influential in the
beginning of our work as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that first climate convening is held
last year in Tucson, Arizona bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues from 1994s, 1890s and 1863s to
come and very much kind of dig into
[SPEAKER_03]: climate issues and begin to look at the
development of climate action plan for
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the extension system across the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the comments that we've heard
coming out of this was one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: impactful meetings that folks had been a
part of where 1862, 1890 and 1994 partners
[SPEAKER_03]: sat around the table sharing their
expertise as well as their interests in
[SPEAKER_03]: climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So coming out of that, that team began
through the core teams of the program
[SPEAKER_03]: master team began to start to look at some
of the work that we needed to then,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that was more, I would say kind
of a, we were taking a cascading look at
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the issues and some of the
expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started to develop that into
logic models or plans of action for the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually look this up things
on the Extension Foundation website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the climate action plan has been
released this year and it's an excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: document that I think can actually help
individual agents but also extension
[SPEAKER_03]: programs to align themselves with this
national movement extension towards
[SPEAKER_03]: climate resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the four models that came out of that
and that you can see in the document is
[SPEAKER_03]: expanding climate smart policy and
policymaker engagement, fostering climate
[SPEAKER_03]: resilience community, implementing climate
response and advancing 21st century
[SPEAKER_03]: community well-being for all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said earlier, if not in the
titles, if you begin to look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: models, you begin to see all of the
program areas in the future reflected in
[SPEAKER_03]: the work and the future work that we're
gonna have to engage in in order for the
[SPEAKER_03]: betterment of all of our communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being one major influence but
another major influence being
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations with Dr. Alton Thompson as
well as the Multistate Research Project
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of lifting off and begin to take
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: We began to have some structured
conversations in extension that were
[SPEAKER_03]: actually supported by the Association
Research Directorate at their past two
[SPEAKER_03]: conferences led by Dr. Raymond Kinney as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we began to have internal
conversations at some of our AEA meetings
[SPEAKER_03]: of what exactly AEA could do around
climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say one of the huge things that
kickstarted this was the NRCS climate
[SPEAKER_03]: smart commodity grants that were awarded
to a lot of our institution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that work is community as
well as farmer-oriented work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that actually began to really push our
extension programs to start to have some
[SPEAKER_03]: of those conversations about climate not
just with our farmers, but with our
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after that, after having those
conversations, a poor group of us that
[SPEAKER_03]: attended the ECOP meeting decided that we
wanted to have our own convening as well
[SPEAKER_03]: as start to develop some plans and some
goals for us internally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1890s had aligned not only with the
ECOP, but also aligned with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Association Research Directors in your
project as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dr. Thompson talked a lot more in depth
about this than I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that 1890 climate convening,
this was a hallway conversation that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually turned into, I would say,
a large-scale event.
[SPEAKER_03]: The technical committees were ARDs once a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we started getting the funds to
have our extension colleagues participate,
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized that having them in the same
space as the researchers, as we're
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning to develop our identity and our
goals in terms of climate task force will
[SPEAKER_03]: be very helpful for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the convening, the researchers,
the technical committee usually has a
[SPEAKER_03]: report out there, and then they have a
planning day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that day-to-day reported out extension
actually met amongst ourselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the researchers reported out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, strategically, on that second
day, we sat within the same room and
[SPEAKER_03]: looked in at this next year and how that's
going to look of integrating research and
[SPEAKER_03]: extension into that project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we had some really good
conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't participate in all of them,
but that justice and policy group was a
[SPEAKER_03]: lively group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've got some good things
planned this year that's really going to
[SPEAKER_03]: engage community informants around the
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to shout out my colleague,
Janine Woods, who is Associate Extension
[SPEAKER_03]: Administrator at Virginia State
University, who was also nominated and
[SPEAKER_03]: voted as the Coney Executive, which will
keep that strong tie between research and
[SPEAKER_03]: extension as we move forward together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was another component to this
that I didn't mention earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2022, we also attempted to host the
Center of Excellence for Farming Systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rural Prosperity, and Economic
Sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through a partnership with EPA,
we decided to deliver our first
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental, Energy, and Economic
Justice Academy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Environmental Justice Academy is
something that has been done for years,
[SPEAKER_03]: EPA, Region 4, and other regions as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we decided that we could utilize this
as a great opportunity for training
[SPEAKER_03]: extension professionals and also bringing
them together in the same space as
[SPEAKER_03]: community organizers and community leaders
of community-based organizations to be
[SPEAKER_03]: trained together in environmental,
economic, and energy justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that economic piece, the piece that we
added as well, that's led by Dr. Gloria
[SPEAKER_03]: Tanubu at Tuskegee University.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been a major, major player in
helping get this off the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just brought in our second cohort
during our convening.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't get as much time to spend with
us, but we did spend time at meals
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were hard at work starting before
us on that first day and ending after us
[SPEAKER_03]: as they had their first session at the
convening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year has almost doubled in size
in terms of participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really looking forward to the
outcome of that this year, this spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2025.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for extension, what we did at the
meeting, especially the first meeting,
[SPEAKER_03]: was establish our central task force.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 20 members from about seven
institutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started discussing existing programs
within the different states and
[SPEAKER_03]: identifying overlap and potential
collaboration so we could have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and as well as identifying key partners
and setting preliminary goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also had a focus group meeting with AT
&T Extension Disaster Education Network at
[SPEAKER_03]: that meeting as well, which I think is
gonna be a great partner with what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's that core task force.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely wanna make sure that they get
recognized for dedicating their time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely look to grow ourselves,
but this core group, I would say are the
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that are gonna ride and die with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely gave up a lot of their
time to be there those two days with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really, really excited looking
forward to how we can actually engage the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire 1890s and greater attention
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a little diagram of how we
are projecting ourselves to move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're directly related to the ECOP Climate
Program Action Team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I participate in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I stated earlier, Dr. Woods is now on
the technical leadership for the ARD
[SPEAKER_03]: Multistate Climate Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an administrative advisor there as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we are actually definitely
following that climate convenience where I
[SPEAKER_03]: met David and had a great conversation
with him about collaboration going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we definitely look to have multiple
people participate and make it going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I already spoke about one relationship
of 1890 similar excellence to the task
[SPEAKER_03]: force.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope to get participation from the
other centers as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we definitely wanna connect
ourselves with USDA, the Regional Climate
[SPEAKER_03]: Helps, NIFA, NRCS, Rural Development and
Forest Service as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also national and regional
nonprofit organizations and foundations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we are doing
currently in the traditional program areas
[SPEAKER_03]: in AEA is developing shared outcome
measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we can have more of a collective
impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did already start going through the
shared measures and pulling out ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: were related to climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are definitely looking to become a
repository for the 1890s extension work
[SPEAKER_03]: that's happening in the area of climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So simple outputs that were identified is
trainings for extension workshop,
[SPEAKER_03]: training for extension professional
workshop for community, some conferences
[SPEAKER_03]: that already exist that could be adapted
to highlight and showcase some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: extension work that is going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also publications and media.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned earlier, this year's issue
of the State of African-Americans in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Belt will be solely focused on
climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really look forward to that being
released in November at the Special
[SPEAKER_03]: Agricultural Workers Conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: That team normally has a session where
they can present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we actually will release that
publication there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the shared outcomes and goals
that we decided on, we will have
[SPEAKER_03]: professional development that will be a la
the Environmental Justice Academy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're looking at some trainings that
are already happening in some of our other
[SPEAKER_03]: institutions and expanding those to the
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, as I mentioned before, those shared
measurable outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also becoming a clearinghouse,
a database for climate related impacts and
[SPEAKER_03]: success stories from the certain
communities in the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also looking towards different funding
opportunities that can drive this towards
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation across the region and
extensions and also integrated research
[SPEAKER_03]: and extension as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah Raymond?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finishing up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank my AA colleagues,
our Executive Director, Dr. Esso,
[SPEAKER_03]: Executive Tune, Dr. Williams, Donna
Richardson, Mark Rattamore, and to my
[SPEAKER_03]: partners that have actually helped in the
research and extension partnership,
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Zoladeye and Julie, Dr. Tune Woods,
and Dr. McKinney, who has helped
[SPEAKER_03]: facilitate all this conversation earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of my presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I think all of us ought to be
very impressed about the depth and extent
[SPEAKER_01]: of work and organization you all have
pulled together, especially in a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: short time period, even with the deeper
roots that you talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just check the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any open ones there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm going to have one if no one
else does for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some coming later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about the
partnerships which we're starting to work
[SPEAKER_01]: on, what's the right way?
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be for all of you, but I'll
address it to you, particularly with an
[SPEAKER_01]: extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think of the 1890s, should we,
who are not from an 1890, should we be
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking of the 1890s as national in scope
or primarily regional, given the maps that
[SPEAKER_01]: you showed about where you're located?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in what context should we think,
I'm going to assume in some ways we should
[SPEAKER_01]: think about you as a national part of the
system, a part of a national system in
[SPEAKER_01]: other ways, regionally, but maybe you can
articulate that a little better for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is definitely national.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even in Dr. Thompson's
presentation, he was mentioning that
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, that kind of experience-based
research and engagement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have partners nationwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have partnerships and programs between
based organizations in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things have come out of the
familiarity with communities in the area
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that to a degree, you know,
we don't have to be isolationist in those,
[SPEAKER_03]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can actually help to facilitate more
communication between those communities
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the 1862s in that area as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely national in scope as well
because of the networks that we have,
[SPEAKER_03]: communities around the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music to my ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, if I may, that when it goes
beyond national, if we know that more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the farmers globally are limited
resources, small farmers, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that the 1890 deal with has more
also relevant at the international level
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ferris, I might add to that because
not everybody would know this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is also, within extension,
another organization called the Global
[SPEAKER_01]: Globalizing Extension Innovation Network,
which some people may have heard of,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is trying to think very hard about
how what we do in a globalized world,
[SPEAKER_01]: how what we do here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to the reality that we're all in a
world with climate just being one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: many global forces that we're all dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we could move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good transition to your
presentation then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it set up and ready to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you
for attending this seminar and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity from David and also Jennifer
for this opportunity to really feature
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the great work that our 1890
institution are being doing at this level
[SPEAKER_00]: about this important topic about climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Ali Ferris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professor of water security,
water energy, food nexus at Prairie VNM
[SPEAKER_00]: University, which is in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk to you today about
leveraging AI and innovation to empower
[SPEAKER_00]: future leaders and resource limited
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, if my slide can go to the next one,
that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the outline of my presentation,
I'm going to have an introduction about
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges of limited resource
communities as it relates to the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the water energy, food nexus and why
is it and how it is relevant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the role of AI and innovation in
addressing challenges related to this
[SPEAKER_00]: topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and so how can we empower future
leaders through education and outreach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, a summary and conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of my objectives of my
presentation would be to highlight the
[SPEAKER_00]: integration of AI and innovation in
addressing resource challenges and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss how training future leaders can
make a significant impact and resource
[SPEAKER_00]: limited communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the challenges of limited
communities are highlighted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low access to resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: These communities encounter significant
barriers in assessing essential resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and services in the water, food and
energy, health and education, such as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's very prevalent to know food
deserts and health deserts and these
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This restricted access inhibits individual
and community development and complicating
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to public health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, inadequate infrastructure and
funding contributes to a persistent cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: of deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge is socioeconomic
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: These communities often face high
unemployment and low income levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These conditions lead to systemic
inequalities and hinder economic
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limited economic diversity and verifies
vulnerability to market changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: complicating growth efforts.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change exacerbate all these
challenges they have been facing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these communities are more vulnerable
to climate change than other communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increased vulnerability are especially
vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These communities to climate change
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to their reliance on natural resources
and low adaptive capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Challenges such as flooding and reduced
crop yield threaten livelihoods,
[SPEAKER_00]: making adaptation difficult due to
socioeconomic instability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more often you have multiple or
complicating disaster that hit these
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitigating strategies for climate change,
addressing climate vulnerability requires
[SPEAKER_00]: an integrated solution involving
infrastructure and community engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also effective strategy must be context
specific, focusing on the unique
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges of limited resources
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building resilience through local
participation can enhance the added
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk today right now
about the water energy food nexus and its
[SPEAKER_00]: relevance to sustainability and
empowerment of limited resources
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graph shows basically the water
energy and food and the interlinkages
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need water for food, like irrigation
crop, food processing, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need food for energy, like other
chemicals, food processing, farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need biofuel, for example,
for energy to produce energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing you need energy to for
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, fuel production to water
distribution to heating and cooling,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also you need water for energy,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are interlinkages between these
different three components within them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also they are influenced by climate
change, population growth, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: governability, how to govern these
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we talk about water
security, energy security, and food
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, dealing with issues of
water by itself on a silo has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to deal with the water issue,
energy issue, and food in a nexus
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the water energy represents
a critical interconnected system,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially essential for sustainability,
where each element influences the other
[SPEAKER_00]: and impacts the global challenges,
climate change, food security,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sustainable, these, there are lots of,
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 goals of sustainable development goals
by the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number six is clean water and sanitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number seven is affordable clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also about food, there is also food
security as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three topics involve several of
the SDGs of the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empowering through action, so community
engagement involving local community and
[SPEAKER_00]: water management and their food security
and their energy security is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also innovative solutions, implementing
technology such as smart irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable energy in agriculture and homes
empower farmers to enhance their
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and sustainability and
reduce, for example, residential energy
[SPEAKER_00]: costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we transform limited resource
community through technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned, empowering them,
local solution, research-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, and community engagement,
as has been discussed in the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about empowering future
leaders through education and outreach and
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of historically black colleges
and university and leadership development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we'll talk about some outreach
activities by program have been doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing some leadership skills as part
of our land grant program here at Prairie
[SPEAKER_00]: View and at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So empowering future leaders through
education and outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importance of HBCU in leadership
development, diversity and representation,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of HBCU students are first-generation
college students, enhancing access to
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: HBCU represents nearly 20% of
African-American undergraduates,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing diversity in academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically the land grant program of
HBCU has also a special impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 50,000 students trained in
agriculture education and extension
[SPEAKER_00]: services, focusing on practical
community-based learning for local
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my previous colleagues who talked
about extension, they are in every single
[SPEAKER_00]: county in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you have also in our area,
in the 1890 Southeastern area,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have also, as it's shown in the
previous talk, represented in most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: counties and counties that really read the
community services with limited resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community engagement and service,
60% of HBCU alumni engage in community
[SPEAKER_00]: service, benefiting underprivileged
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also partnership with local organization
creates service learning opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: that are transformative influences,
empower students to advocate for social
[SPEAKER_00]: justice and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first speaker discussed that in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alumni often take leadership roles in
local government and nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiatives in urban agriculture and
renewable energy showcase commitment to
[SPEAKER_00]: local solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Policy advocacy and economic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: HBCU's advocate for equitable access to
resources, serve as incubator for
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurship, helping start local
businesses, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna talk right now about the
outreach activities, designed to engage
[SPEAKER_00]: students in AI and sustainability topics
and developing leadership skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: One project that is funded through NIFA
capacity building, NIFA main funding is
[SPEAKER_00]: called Get Act Smart, building capacity in
smart agriculture technology for
[SPEAKER_00]: underserved community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a joint project between Prairie
View and Texas A&M University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project will enhance the training of
underrepresented students in agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also provide training for agricultural
professional on advancing agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: technology through informal learning
objects, developing by youth participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are dealing with, and this graph or
schematic summarized the activities of the
[SPEAKER_00]: project basically we are dealing with
smart technology in agriculture as the
[SPEAKER_00]: center dealing with issues of
post-harvesting agriculture production,
[SPEAKER_00]: human and animal nutrition, water
resources and food and feed through using
[SPEAKER_00]: these innovative technologies like sensing
and IOT, big data analytics, modeling and
[SPEAKER_00]: virtual reality and how to train students
and understanding this interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: ag and these new technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this project, we gave lectures
to non-agricultural students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was given, lectures given last
year to college state college station
[SPEAKER_00]: students, the occasional career awareness
of the impact of lecturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to under graduate students,
the objective was to analyze climate smart
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture students knowledge outcomes
from giving them presentation about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give presentation, we test the
student before and after and we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of this on their, so this analysis
found that the intervention of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lectures enhanced all student knowledge
about climate smart agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations and career opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the impact was higher with
underrepresented student more than other
[SPEAKER_00]: students from the interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, finding the intervention elevated
interest in pursuing climate smart
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture career and post-graduation as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project has developed outlet for
current knowledge through test
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplinary and multi-disciplinary and
problem solving learning for all
[SPEAKER_00]: interested students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another project funded also through
capacity building, this one is AI based
[SPEAKER_00]: programming for advanced research and
education and extension activity and
[SPEAKER_00]: precision agriculture at Prairie View and
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of this project was to
strengthen research, student training and
[SPEAKER_00]: extension capacity at Prairie View in AI
and remote sensing to deal with crop
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has dissemination component,
training component, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: research components.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just again, it's heads up where we
have a couple more minutes and some people
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna have to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, well, I will wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the experimental of the two
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the graph showing the two
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are data collection by students,
post-graduate in all these technologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: AI based and CO2 emissions and,
I'm sorry, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I accidentally hit my, sorry, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back, finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the organized field
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, for example, we have PhD and
graduate students from UT Austin and the
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students from PV and Texas A&M
and these are K through 12 through ag
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: All came in one day and at the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see multi-generation learning
about smart agriculture, limited climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change by our group and our site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, okay, so this is again also
similar field days and demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have REU funded by NIFA also
projects where we demonstrate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: students how to use technology also to
solve water issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We engage community through field day
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing the activities that we
conducted as part of that field day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also again, field day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of another field day
demonstration that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have, this is some of the
colleagues that participated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also developed some extension
bulletins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video I'll pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are extension bulletin that we
developed based fact sheets that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available that we use as a part of our
outreach program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communicating with local TV here about
droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conclusions, AI technology innovation
offer a transformative solution for the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges faced in limited resources
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These innovation can directly impact
sustainability, climate resilience and
[SPEAKER_00]: community wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a difference whether through
supporting existing initiatives or
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing, replicating these solutions in
our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work together to create lasting
change by fostering innovation in the face
[SPEAKER_00]: of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, we have to thank our
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my team and colleagues working
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot end without acknowledging
the support from NIFA, USDA, NIFA for
[SPEAKER_00]: their capacity building and other funding,
also the NSF and AgriLife.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'll be happy to entertain any
of your question if you have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I really wish we had a whole
hour from now to delve into a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion and dialogue about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a very packed program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and some people have had to leave
already, but if there are any questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing any right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, since I always have questions,
I'm gonna ask you one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate, and relate and applaud
sort of the focus you had in leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: development and in your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder to what extent you think about
there's a connection between what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do there and something that
we're hearing more and more about in the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate and energy context about the
relationship between leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: development and leadership training and
job readiness and job preparedness in the
[SPEAKER_01]: context of the need for a different set of
skills for, particularly for students
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out, but also adult training,
people coming out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having to make a transition in a different
economy, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I can tell you that our
college is on the lead on this effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a new MS degree program in
natural social environmental science that
[SPEAKER_00]: deals with where we teach all these
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the process of developing a PhD
program on water, energy, food,
[SPEAKER_00]: nexus, and sustainability, where we
emphasizing some of these principle that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are talking, emphasize more because for
all the training, the professional on the
[SPEAKER_00]: job of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need skills that the conventional
curricula didn't offer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to modify a curricula to
address those future and current needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one last quick thing, just in case
there's a quick answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you connecting AI in the work you're
doing with machine learning models in any
[SPEAKER_01]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume the question is for me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have published some work on using
machine learning and analyzing the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection between CO2 emission and
temperature and soil moisture and other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that influence that particular
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, once again, thank you so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: A round of appreciation from everybody,
maybe mutual group hug, as Jenny
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody has a fabulous afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
