[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought it would be interesting to
give an update on the Adapt 10 technology
[SPEAKER_03]: and specifically how integration with
other software platforms is really
[SPEAKER_03]: critical if you want to bring this kind of
technology to the farming community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I do, I want to introduce this
gentleman here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Professor Rafael Otto.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been here for a few weeks now,
but I hadn't had a chance to introduce
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a professor of soil science at the
University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's interested in this particular
topic in improving nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, so Kevin will do the second
part remotely.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is in Minnesota right now, but we
thought it would be a great way to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about the opportunities around this
kind of integration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so quick overview.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Adapt 10, it has a bit of a history
coming out of Cornell, out of my program,
[SPEAKER_03]: very much a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we rolled it out in 2008, which is
already 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in 2013, we decided that it
wasn't good to remain in the public space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we decided to license it to a
startup company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we continued working on it and it
became a cloud-based solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did a lot of on-farm validation of
the technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in 2017 was a great year for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The startup company was acquired by Yara
International, which is a big global crop
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Norwegian company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in like 160 countries or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won a big international prize around
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were only a month apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a very nice time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working also on API integration,
so integration with other software
[SPEAKER_03]: systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then earlier this year, Yara sold the
Adapt 10 technology to EverAg,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really a sort of digital
agriculture platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they have field management
software, but also livestock-related,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe, insurance and financing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're a very big player in the
digital agriculture space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly, I'm not gonna go into
details, but this has very much been a
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple team efforts here at Cornell
University, as well as when it went
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some very talented entrepreneurs,
software engineers, marketing people,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also worked with many farmers,
consultants in New York, in Iowa,
[SPEAKER_03]: in North Carolina, many other places to
validate and test and refine the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so why Adapt 10?
[SPEAKER_03]: So nitrogen is by far the most problematic
of the crop nutrients, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an overstatement, I don't
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the sort of farmer perspective,
it's costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The use efficiency tends to be relatively
low, because there's a lot of losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of uncertainty around
it, especially as it relates to weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that association also, a high
sensitivity to climate change,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially extreme events.
[SPEAKER_03]: From an environmental perspective,
five major concerns are big energy input
[SPEAKER_03]: into cropping systems, nitrous oxide,
of course, the big greenhouse gas concern,
[SPEAKER_03]: groundwater nitrate levels, as well as the
hypoxia and anoxia concerns in estuaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dead zones, and then particulates
formation from ammonia volatilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of concerns there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go into a little bit more depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we think about the input inputs
into the system, into a field,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might say, we have kind of two major
inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is through the biological pathway,
mostly legumes or maybe some free living
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the synthetic industrial
process, Haber-Bosch, notably takes a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Birkeland aided, by the way, is an older
technology that was developed by Yara at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time, Norsk Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That now has gaining some interest because
of the interest in green ammonia using a
[SPEAKER_03]: renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, there's a lot of
cycling of this organic nitrogen through
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil organic matter or inputs or
residues or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have all these different sources of
nitrogen that you have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have a fairly complicated
nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't go into details, but you have
all these inputs that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the transformations that
happen in the soil are microbially
[SPEAKER_03]: mediated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that they're impacted by the
environment, the temperature, water,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also crop management practices and all
of those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most nitrogen in aerobic environments ends
up in the nitrate form and thereby is then
[SPEAKER_03]: subject to losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either leaching losses or
denitrification losses, both being
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously very problematic and then these
transformations and the associated crop
[SPEAKER_03]: and availability can change dramatically
in very short periods of time,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you get a lot of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit about the hypoxia zone
because that's very relevant when you are
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with nitrogen, especially in corn
production systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably most of you are familiar
with that, especially in the Mississippi
[SPEAKER_03]: River basin, the large so-called dead zone
that develops typically in the mid to late
[SPEAKER_03]: summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this past year, this is an updated
graph, the dead zone was again about the
[SPEAKER_03]: size of the state of New Jersey,
very large area where basically most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fish are being killed because of a
lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the, I should say,
this is the level of the hypoxia task
[SPEAKER_03]: force goal, which is less than 1,900.
[SPEAKER_03]: square miles and they have not been able
to reach that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of money being poured into it,
but relatively few results.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hypoxia task force is pushing the
states to reduce their nitrogen losses and
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce them by 45%.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what these two states, they're big
corn states, of course, what their goals
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long-term 45% with no timeline,
which is very convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for 2025, they said minus 15%,
which as far as I know has not been
[SPEAKER_03]: reached.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they've tried that
hard, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The greenhouse gas emissions, so nitrous
oxide is about 18% of the global
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little less than, let's say one
fifth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's notable is how little
attention it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the attention goes to carbon
dioxide and of course, methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: For US ag, it's a little over 50% of the
greenhouse gas emissions are associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's more than the methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, doesn't this look like a
presidential polling result of the past
[SPEAKER_03]: few days, especially with the red and the
blue and all of that, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems kind of tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so pretty significant,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And very little attention being paid to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For New York, sorry, you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a little thing here that's a zoom
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about one third is nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot more livestock, especially
dairy industry in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So methane is a bigger deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the nitrous oxide estimates are a
little low for New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: But New York is all in on the methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's millions of dollars are going to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little as far as I know on the
nitrous oxide issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so in order to understand why it's
difficult to affect change with farmers on
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, we need to understand the risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So farmers are inherently risk managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have nerves of steel to be a
farmer these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have here an economic optimum end
rate, that's the perfectly right nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: rate for a particular crop in a particular
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And think corn, because that's our focus
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So risk is probability times cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have this asymmetric risk for the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, if they under-fertilize,
because there's uncertainty around this EO
[SPEAKER_03]: and R, if they under-fertilize,
it's a lot more costly to them than if
[SPEAKER_03]: they over-fertilize, because they lose
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially when the grain prices are
high, which they were a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't want to lose yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you over-fertilize, you wasted money on
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's much less costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a much lower risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the farmer has an incentive to always
make sure that there's enough nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: that means that they tend to apply excess
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just realistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just risk management on their part.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from a societal perspective,
it's kind of the opposite in that we like
[SPEAKER_03]: to see farmers apply less nitrogen
fertilizer and not over-fertilize,
[SPEAKER_03]: because then you see a lot of losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our work, some of the work that
was done at Michigan State, where we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been able to demonstrate once you exceed
the planned uptake, you obviously have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot more losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of opposing interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the solution to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, from our perspective, the solution
is to get this uncertainty down to very
low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very minimal, so that we can estimate what
is the proper nitrogen rate for your crop
[SPEAKER_03]: in any particular field, in any particular
year, in any particular location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get rid of that OK here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry response to that has been the
four Rs of nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right source, right rate, right time,
right place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're promoting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great concept, but the problem is what's
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you define what's right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially when it comes to rate,
the problem is that the rate is defined by
[SPEAKER_03]: the other three Rs, source, time,
place, as well as weather and many other
[SPEAKER_03]: factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a complicated issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to illustrate that, this is data from
Iowa State University that shows the
[SPEAKER_03]: economic optimum end rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: From many nitrogen response trials over a
number of years and many locations,
[SPEAKER_03]: that shows quite a distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one could ask the question,
well, what's the correct nitrogen rate?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to decide that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be from 50 to 250.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is corn after soybean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can throw up your hands and say,
well, is there maybe something underlying
[SPEAKER_03]: that causes this variability?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the ISU recommendation is this one
here, around 150.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would mean that in about a third
of the cases, you would under-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_03]: In about two thirds of the cases,
you would over-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, having a very generalized
recommendation, which they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state of Iowa, number one corn state,
the recommendations is the same for every
[SPEAKER_03]: field and every year in the state,
every soil type, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do better than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the work that we did,
starting maybe about 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we started to look at this temporal
or weather-induced variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jason Kohopka, who some of you may know
as the associate dean of the grad school
[SPEAKER_03]: here, he was a master student with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in one case, we needed 110 kilograms
per hectare.
[SPEAKER_03]: In another year, we needed 220.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, huge differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is here at the Musgrave Farm in New
York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shansukh Beji, who was a PhD student,
started to work with the leachum model and
[SPEAKER_03]: said, hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we incorporate weather information,
we can sort of simulate these effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was basically the idea behind
ADAPTEN to say, we can make better
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations by incorporating these
factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more recently, some work came out of
Illinois, where they did a meta-analysis
[SPEAKER_03]: of many site years in the US and Eastern
Canada, where they looked at what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: main source of variability in this
economic optimum end rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was basically weather, so
especially precipitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two-thirds of the variability was
weather-related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't incorporate weather into your
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You miss a lot of the information that's
critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil factors was second, about 10% to 23%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they said, well, you need to also
account for risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, of course, we had already been
working on at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was nice to see this confirmed,
some of the earlier work that we did and
[SPEAKER_03]: justification for use like a tool of
ADAPTEN.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the recommendations that are
being used around the United States and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually anywhere else in the world almost
are either static or they are what we
[SPEAKER_03]: might call dynamic and adaptive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So static is basically the one that I just
illustrated with Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_03]: The official New York recommendations are
also static.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're relatively simplistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't account for weather as a source
of variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other category is the dynamic or
adaptive approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be soil testing like a PSNT.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be canopy sensors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it can be models, which is really the
area that we sort of started to work in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they each have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main question, however, is does it
give you a good recommendation?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have fancy equipment, but if it
doesn't give you a good rate, then what's
[SPEAKER_03]: the point?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to prove that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other kind of complicating factor is
that a lot of these recommendations are
[SPEAKER_03]: based on very simple cropping systems like
corn after corn or corn after soybean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we're interested in more diverse
type of cropping systems in a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-objective environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We care about soil health, about carbon
sequestration, about water quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: about energy, about greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're bringing in these more
sustainable type cropping systems or
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative rotations, cover cropping,
using more organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have higher yielding crop genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have better fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just base all your
recommendations on these very simple
[SPEAKER_03]: systems, you're missing some of the
technological innovations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really was the whole point of
Adapt-In.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this here shows the Adapt-In as a
standalone user interface, the way it was
[SPEAKER_03]: originally offered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Kevin is going to be showing how this
technology is better integrated with other
[SPEAKER_03]: field management systems, because that's
what farmers are using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers don't want to use a standalone
piece of software.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it to be part of another piece
of software that already has a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: data in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are some of these inputs for
Adapt-In?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to go into details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is sourced automatically,
like climate data, soils data as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own soil databases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's user inputs on basically
soil and crop management practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertilized applications, manure,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll see that some of these kind of
regenerative practices are also included
[SPEAKER_03]: in that cover cropping, rotations,
organic amendments, and all of those kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the model basically discretizes
the soil into layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it discretizes in time on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on daily climate data are the
simulations that then generate a
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just quickly about some of the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a graph.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually developed by Jim Schepers
from the ARS after we shared the data with
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is based on field validations
where we had strips in a field where we
[SPEAKER_03]: had an Adapt-In rate and we had a grower
rate, whatever the grower used to apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see on the left side of the graph,
those were the situations where Adapt-In
[SPEAKER_03]: recommended less nitrogen than what the
grower was using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that there was virtually
no yield loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the average, no yield loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the savings were with the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 83% of the cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the remaining 70% of the cases,
we Adapt-In recommended more than the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower, but it was justified by a yield
increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of the situation that you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: In most cases, you reduce your end rate,
but you acknowledge that, especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: wet years, you may actually need a little
bit more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, you can actually have
considerable benefits in terms of profits,
[SPEAKER_03]: both in terms of saving on fertilizer or
avoiding yield losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the environmental losses,
you can simply, by using a more precise
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation, you can significantly use
your environmental losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left is leaching losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the dots above the one-to-one line
meant that there was a reduction in
[SPEAKER_03]: leaching losses from Adapt-In relative to
growers, and the same on the right side
[SPEAKER_03]: with the gaseous losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 36% to 39% reduction simply by not
over-fertilizing, basically, in the vast
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of the cases, without any yield
losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also did work with some third
parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notably, University of Nebraska has a
great on-farm trial network, really
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were interested in testing
Adapt-In.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see on the left there that
for one of the fields, they had several of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just showing for one field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Adapt-In recommended a much lower rate
than the canopy sensor or what the grower
[SPEAKER_03]: was using.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see that the yields are
basically the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good situation, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same yield with less nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also did some multirate trials,
where you can determine the economic
[SPEAKER_03]: optimum end rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they compared Adapt-In with Grower,
another commercial product that's now off
[SPEAKER_03]: the market from Corteva, and then the
University of Nebraska recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that Adapt-In did very
well in terms of following that one-to-one
[SPEAKER_03]: line, which is really what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been nice to have third parties do
some evaluations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, before I hand it over to Kevin,
I wanted to maybe talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: learnings from doing this, having a
product and integrating it with commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: software.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, commercialization is critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adapt-In would be dead, died on the vine
if we didn't license it and partner with a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Software integration, as Kevin will show,
is critical for scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want farmers to use it,
you got to integrate it with other
[SPEAKER_03]: software systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these cloud-based software end
solutions have very distinct advantages,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when it comes to scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to buy equipment or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can scale it up relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So specifically for Adapt-In, Yara,
when it was still within Yara,
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketing department did a survey of
Adapt-In users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number one thing that they really
valued was the scientific validity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does matter to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff out there at very
muddy borders, but they like the
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific validity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The customer churn rate is relatively low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most people that start to use Adapt-In
want to keep using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't say, it doesn't work,
and they throw it to the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third-party providers offer additional
scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both Yara and now EverAg do work with
what are basically competitors and say
[SPEAKER_03]: they will make Adapt-In.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have that additional scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my experience is that the public
sector really struggles with this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like the old recommendation systems
that are very simple, and then you have
[SPEAKER_03]: much more innovative, improved technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both within the land-grant university
system as well as state agencies,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't really know how to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a topic for another
discussion at some point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so with that, I'm now going to
hand it over to Kevin, who is in
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota, and he's going to do a
demonstration of the Adapt-In tool within
[SPEAKER_03]: the Fieldalytics field management software
system, so within their platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Kevin, you can take over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and start sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the invite to present
Fieldalytics and the integration of
[SPEAKER_00]: Adapt-In into Fieldalytics to this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit, the history that I have that
I think is important in my role today is I
[SPEAKER_00]: spent 25 years in production agriculture
in the retail setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started off out of college, have a BS in
geography with GIS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started off with a crop consultant,
teaching basically university extension
[SPEAKER_00]: people throughout the United States on how
GPS is going to work in tractors,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's going to work in combines,
and how the data is going to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been in this game quite a long
time, and the thing that I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: working towards is efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make the tool more efficient so
we can get it to more people?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the drivers on why I left
retail and went to Yara with Adapt-In back
[SPEAKER_00]: in April of 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to help them understand retail
better, understand the grower at the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: gate better, so we can build a tool that
could help with a lot of the issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: Harold talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that really hits home is,
Harold mentioned the EONR.
[SPEAKER_00]: In universities and people who are
researching, we understand that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: is finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you try to convince the grower
that they need to cut 40 to 50 to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of nitrogen out of their program,
it's a hard sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had rather pay the money for the
extra nitrogen to not have the yield loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working in conjunction trying to
help ease some of that pain, and this tool
[SPEAKER_00]: has really opened up a lot of eyes,
but we need to get to a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's 96 million acres of corn in
the United States, today we're running in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 500,000 acres of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not even the tip of the iceberg
here on the number of fields and farms
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can touch and help manage nitrogen
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the industry, for the environment,
for everything, it's the right thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm excited to take this
job with EverAg.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a product manager, as now I'm helping
the developers and our modelers make
[SPEAKER_00]: things more efficient and put into this
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to give you a little
rundown of the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually our software demos take two,
sometimes three hours, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me, I'm going to condense this
into 20 minutes and do the best I can in
[SPEAKER_00]: that 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the software, this is a,
we call it an FMIS, a farm management
[SPEAKER_00]: information system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a true GIS because I can't write
scripts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do a lot of third-party stuff,
but we have grower farms and fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this would be what a typical retailer
would look like where they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations and then they would
have, within that location, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have growers and then a grower would have
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just share this,
my little demo farm here that I call KOA
[SPEAKER_00]: Adapt-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within that I have, I have a handful of
different farms that I manage and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I were a retail agronomist or a
grower that had access to this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to look at my farms, I could come
to this dashboard and I could pull up this
[SPEAKER_00]: dashboard and quickly look through what
are my nitrogen needs for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this RX has given me a min,
average, and max nitrogen need for each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see this field's calling for 137
pounds of nitrogen today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field's 98 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field's 130 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can, I can click around and I can
open up the map and it'll zoom to the map
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can see what, what encompasses that
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look through, I can click on a cell
and it'll tell me what is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look over here and see that on the
right side, I can see a few of the metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: for that field, such as planning date,
rainfall since planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is current day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at all the information
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see I don't have any applications
set on this field and I got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: left to do, but this is, this is the area
that the retail agronomist or the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant will spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come in here on a daily basis and
look, or, you know, when it's that,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's on schedule to say, I need to
see what's going on in these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come here just to see where that's
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real, the real power of this tool is
having an integration with Fieldalytics is
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to batch process or do batch
things in batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just come back out here to
my grower level and I'm going to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: here to configure fields on AdaptN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I can do, every field
that I have a check mark in, I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: enrolled into the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I, if I have a grower come and say I
need, I want to enroll these three fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say click that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hit enroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does then is it starts a process
and sends that through the API to the
[SPEAKER_00]: AdaptN model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts building out the soil types,
the auto generated layers that Harold was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal in the future is to make more
layers automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I click through some of these
layers, you'll get an idea of how we might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the start of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to hit enroll because I
don't want to enroll any extra acres that
[SPEAKER_00]: are enrolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it will trigger an invoice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I have the fields enrolled,
then I can start to, I can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: configure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just pick a couple of fields here
and I can go into configure selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what I'm doing is I have these two
fields that I have not configured yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them in a role that I haven't
configured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come in and I can do them
individually or I can do them in a batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can say, okay, my expected yield on
these fields is 225 bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have 105 day corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I plan to plant somewhere around April
15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can look at it individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come back in after the fact and say,
okay, I actually didn't get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: field until April 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can just change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also load different yield management
zones, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really easy to create a system
where you can do multiple fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I could go 10 fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go 20 fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do his whole farm at this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really a powerful thing that we
had some of that in the past, but not to
[SPEAKER_00]: this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us to batch process and
enroll multiple fields at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the purpose of showing you some
transparency and get more granular with
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, I'm going to zoom into just one
field and I'm going to spend most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: time that I have on this one field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the power of having an integration and
using an API to shell out, to adapt and to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab that information, that nitrogen rack
is, it allows all of the data to be in one
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the issues that I had as a
user of AdaptED when I was back in retail
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of the customer feedback that we
get is that there are times when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to leave a software.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to come in here and take my
yield data and export it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to export my soil test
because it's all export, import,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're touching things a lot of times
that you won't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have this system where
everything is sitting, then you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to configure the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can come in here and I can look and
say, okay, what's my expected yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this particular field, I'm using a
yield potential layer that I created off
[SPEAKER_00]: of a normalized yield map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can assign different yield goals to
it here, or I can take what the data is in
[SPEAKER_00]: my tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start to look at population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this field, they didn't have a variable
rate planter, so he just put one flat
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at the prior crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can change the tillage method,
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using my most recent soil test
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put in an emergent state when that
crop came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field was planted May 18th,
or March, yeah, May 18th, and it took a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very wet this spring in southern
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add a cover crop if there was a
cover crop to it, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this screen gives us a lot of
versatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all that is entered, it sends the
data on its way, and then a rec comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in season, this rec will update daily,
but we shut this off around August 15th,
[SPEAKER_00]: August 30th, just because people are not
applying nitrogen after that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look at this particular field,
I can see what the setup is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So May 13th was the planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had full emergence on May 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had 23.4 inches of rain since
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estimated growth stage, this stops at DT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that we're looking for in the
future is how do we expand this out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the R stages, and does that make sense,
or do we just stop it at DT and that's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the maturity class prior crop
tillage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look at organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this field has an organic matter range
from 1.4 to 13.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not abnormal in the region that I
work in, so we work a lot with different
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matters, and that's important
because it's a mineralization factor that
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people don't take into account
when they're figuring their nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our yield targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I want to hit on,
why one of the major reasons why the
[SPEAKER_00]: integration with EverEgg and Fieldalytics
is big for ADAPTED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I have a yield target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a yield goal going into the
season, but it's not always attained due
[SPEAKER_00]: to environmental factors that you can't
control as Harold touched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I start this year, then I've got a
266 bushel yield goal, which this field
[SPEAKER_00]: has attained that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been in the 260s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unreasonable to have that goal to
start, but then I start to think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: alright, I didn't plant this field until
May 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had kind of a slow emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool and wet this spring,
so how can I justify changing that rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a couple different ways that
we can do it, and it depends on what your
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy philosophy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My agronomy philosophy is I'm going to
look at historical data to see what did
[SPEAKER_00]: this achieve with similar years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different ways that you can
look to see what was similar, what was
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tools that ADAPTED has that we
can run in the old user interface is a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-year comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this shows us is what were my
nitrogen needs for this field the past
[SPEAKER_00]: years that it was corn, because I just
wanted to simplify it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go back to 2010 and do every year,
but I skipped a few years, and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: look and see, okay, what's similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this 2018 seems pretty similar to what
2014 is for loss, recommendation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I start to look at my data and
say, okay, what happened in 2018 in this
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can load up the 2018 yield data,
and I can look at this and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm, well, I had 170 bushel yield average,
and I had quite a few areas here that this
[SPEAKER_00]: spot here was 89 bushels, this spot was 63
bushels, over here on this little sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: on this little wet hole is 93 bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did obtain some okay yields,
215, 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first thought is I am going to
reassign my yield estimates because the
[SPEAKER_00]: 266 bushels is not accurate or realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I could take this past year's yield
data, but I don't really want to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not exactly what's going to
happen this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go back to in-season
imagery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in here, and I'm going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: through my in-season imagery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine with me, it's July 15th,
and the corn's about V18, V16,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to wide drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is I would come in and
find the most recent image closest to that
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if it's July 15th, none of
these would be populated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll look at this July 12th image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that image comes up, it's going
to show me the NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can see what is my crop vigor in
those spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell I've got almost crop
failure or really poor leaf reflectance in
[SPEAKER_00]: those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can assume that these are poor
yielding areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could also go out and scout that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can send this to the Fieldolytics mobile
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at this image as I go out
there, and I can verify on foot as well if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use this layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a new yield potential for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would come into this tool and say
Create Yield Potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to call it July 12th Yield
Adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to tell it what commodity I'm
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corn, field, and bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taking these numbers from a
database that Everag has generated off of
[SPEAKER_00]: NAS data based on historic yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's saying in this field, the range is
going to be from 178 to 276 on a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: year, on an average year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I create that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can come in and look at that
created layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes just a minute as it rasterizes
that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have this yield estimation layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can edit that as well because it's
going off of averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel that I'm above average or
at average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do that two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this back to what I feel
is appropriate for that season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to go average yield 210.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my range is going to be from 134 to
232.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can submit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got a yield potential layer
that I can load into ADAPT-N that will
[SPEAKER_00]: change the REC accordingly based on those
yield estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come back into the ADAPT-N
configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under expected yield, I'm going to
unlock that layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to change my expected yield
average to 210.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to use that July 12th Yield
Adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to give me values that look
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say this whole,
because I went out and scouted it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not going to be 143 bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take that down to 120
bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these areas over here, I also looked
at those because I didn't feel that those
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take those to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives the agronomist the opportunity
to change things on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might say where the field where it's
good is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could change that to 245,
whatever you felt that number was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you save that configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what it's doing is hitting the
API, sending that data to the ADAPT-N
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes just a minute because it's
that it tells me that my configuration was
[SPEAKER_00]: complete and that ADAPT-N accepted the
configuration changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it usually takes about two minutes
for it to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those two minutes, I'll go to
another field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at something else on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe look at some statistics or try and
figure out what my next step is with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the calculations,
there's quite a few calculations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being done on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no slower than if we were in the user
interface working within the model itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other things that are really great
about being integrated is the
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: My soil test I can look at my pH's and I
can make that I can make a decision if I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to add pH to the model or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our users will add it
automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others might say pretty neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm not going to mess around with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could look at this and say,
OK, in this sand area here, I've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty high pH's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want to add my pH to the
configuration if I haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different different advantages
of being in all the data in one as applied
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that's applied to the field,
if the if the controller is hooked up to
[SPEAKER_00]: field elitics, then the data will come
back into the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have access to everything in one
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see part of it is back because
the yield has changed to two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed to 17 because I changed those
high high level to 245, but the rec still
[SPEAKER_00]: is still is on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can use what we have and it can
come back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the user then would would then the next
step would be to pull up the PDF off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this tells tells us is what's
going on in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening that would make that
recommendation 91 pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see the range of total and
loss so we can look throughout the season
[SPEAKER_00]: on what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our losses are from the men and the Max
and the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can break that down into a gas loss
or a leaching loss, so I didn't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of gas loss this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my loss came from the leaching
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is normal to the amount of moisture
we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm looking at the field capacity
of moisture and you can see how the up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were wet most of the year up until
probably early July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it dried out and we finally got back
into the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There probably wasn't a wheel turn spring
or side dressing in southern Minnesota
[SPEAKER_00]: from June 10th to July 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that much rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's you know the different graphs that
we we look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower and the and the agronomist
can can see what's happening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we getting that if we have fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Application of ammonia then we look at OK,
what's mineralizing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we getting some winter losses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was it warm here so we can see
this is not normal for Minnesota in this
[SPEAKER_00]: February March time frame to have averages
of 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistently, usually it's it's down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold spell January February this year,
so first for winter lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a dismal winter,
but for people that like the warmth that
[SPEAKER_00]: was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can break it out lost by different soil
structure, so sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaching so this this field the two red
spots in the field were sand, so we are
[SPEAKER_00]: losing a lot of nitrogen on that sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk to this girl or the next year and
say maybe we pull the anhydrous bar up as
[SPEAKER_00]: we go across those spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not worth it to put that
nitrogen down in those areas and we we
[SPEAKER_00]: treat it differently or we go to a all
spring urea application variable rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: just start with a lower rate at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all the metrics that that we
look at when we're trying to define what
[SPEAKER_00]: what the wreck will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that other wreck is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can look to see now how.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wreck is adjusted by changing that
nitrogen that yield that yield goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were we're going to go from a 95
pound rate to a 40 pound rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking at a new
recommendation based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lower yield goal, which is more
realistic to what the season is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the user would go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and take this to the field to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the how much time do I
have left Harold?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just about out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, OK, so I just want to do one more
thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing about this is a tool
that's in this tool set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really powerful is I'm going to
pick this field, so I'm going to get ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to take this to the to the field to
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I can do is I could come in here
and select this adapt and only rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a product built in here called
just straight nitrogen, so I just call it
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt and nitrogen need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I run this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do a flat rate comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember this field was calling
for 40 pounds event, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: submit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you would send the the
product to the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sends direct if your machine or asset
is connected, we can send it right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do jump drives and stuff
like that that we had to do in the old
[SPEAKER_00]: user interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this is showing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red areas are being under applied and
the green areas are being over applied or
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this 50 pound application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're going to put on this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas are getting 135 pounds and some
areas should get a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than that, and so what it does is it shows
the farmer that if I went out with that 50
[SPEAKER_00]: pound rate or the yeah, if I went out with
that 50 pound rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas I would be under applying by
110 pounds and other areas I would over
[SPEAKER_00]: apply by 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: By by doing a flat rate application,
you're not putting the right product in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right place, and that's the main
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the four R's is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if I were to recommend if this person
absolutely did not want to do variable
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommendation to that grower would be
you need to be somewhere in that 120 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 pound range across the field because
you want to maximize the yield at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's really unfortunate that
people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they can do and not utilizing the
tools that are out there with the GPS and
[SPEAKER_00]: variable rate application, and it's
getting more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things are coming online faster
than ever and looking forward to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the next 10 years are going to go
with with all this technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: automation and an AI evaluations of fields
and data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you don't have to go out and boot
check it or you can use data imagery more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and have more more images
available so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, yeah, appreciate the time I get
excited when I when I think about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities that users have now today
with adapt in and just appreciate Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: and Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, coming up with the tool and and
hopefully we can continue the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: to to continue to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing that the University of
validity is is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That check they want that that I know what
I'm doing is right and I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that gave you a little bit of a
taste of the benefits that we have from
[SPEAKER_03]: integration with other software and
innovations that are happening on that end
[SPEAKER_03]: and and how we basically can partner with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Janice, you have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't no OK where he heralded
unintended on one of these slides as a
[SPEAKER_02]: cousin out of the school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was entering this presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really delighted to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of a problem in the
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sense my passive soil was discussed and
I just want to understand this aspect of
[SPEAKER_02]: it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in an organization, of course,
you're going to get better from your
[SPEAKER_02]: climate and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you starting from a position of
having a soil health very good on so
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate and then work with that model
or how is the end supply the capacity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil itself being produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we we we basically have kind of two
pools that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is the is the sort of organic
matter pool and the mineralization of sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're basing that currently on
basically on organic matter and texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we we're not using any of the sort of
health indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I'd like to do,
but it's not that widely measured.
[SPEAKER_03]: So organic matter is standard soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other pool is the more labor pool that
is associated with sort of these more
[SPEAKER_03]: recent additions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin didn't have time to really talk
about that, but we we worked and Matt Ryan
[SPEAKER_03]: actually contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt was here, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Helped and Steve Mersky as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good data on cover crop
management contributions or previous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my earlier work at the Willisboro farm
on alfalfa contributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are kind of seen as more labile
pools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had sort of organic matter
pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's you know, you have to have to make
shortcuts, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to focus on what what really
matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, so that's basically manure,
of course, is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, being here in New York,
we put a lot of effort into the manure
[SPEAKER_03]: component.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and it's interesting because the here
in New York, especially the consultants,
[SPEAKER_03]: so ACS, which is the big crop consulting
company, their headquarters right here by
[SPEAKER_03]: the airport on the foreign roads,
they're developing new software that
[SPEAKER_03]: focuses a little bit more on the dairy
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're going to be one of the
users of adapt and to their own ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_03]: to their own platform, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but but yeah, the manure issue is any
of these organic inputs, as you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: are much tougher to deal with than sort of
like a straight, you know, urea or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, liquid solution or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can take a little bit of
pride on on that component.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that I think we've done a fairly
good job.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No,
[SPEAKER_03]: not that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did work with Environmental Defense
Fund a few years ago on the issue of
[SPEAKER_03]: benchmark, the end balance benchmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see how that sort of related to
actual recommendations and whether,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you'd be able to meet a certain
criteria or certain and balance
[SPEAKER_03]: benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about about the extent of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been one of the reasons why
we decided to go and license it is is
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was very difficult to work with
other universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you do an innovation, you're to
some extent disrupting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't like the term disrupting
because it's kind of overused.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the U.S., we have a land grant
university system and every state has
[SPEAKER_03]: their own language university and has
their own nutrient recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we only have that with nutrient
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have it with tillage or cover
crop recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nutrients, every state has their own
recommendation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our system was much more universal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so it was difficult working with
the specialists in each of the land grant
[SPEAKER_03]: university.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we said, OK, let's and let's and
just go to commercial route.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really, really glad we did,
because you can see the the result that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you work with the commercial sector,
you can really innovate and keep
[SPEAKER_03]: innovating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would need to talk to the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the the company has an exclusive
license so so they can sub license,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Cornell cannot sub license to someone
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we've always worked with with
other organizations like University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Nebraska, Auburn University, NC State
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there the company is very open to
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always are careful that because
sometimes you have collaborators who don't
[SPEAKER_03]: use the tool properly and then they say,
oh, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And say, no, you didn't use it properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's but yeah, in general,
they're very open to that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge attribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin demonstrates something I was
watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things that how we get the.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the vast majority of the
users are these consultants, these people,
[SPEAKER_03]: these agronomists, and they could work
either with, you know, say a co-op,
[SPEAKER_03]: they could be a private consultant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they work with a larger company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, Kevin, you can chime in a little
bit on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say it's now fairly rare
that's an individual farmer, although it
[SPEAKER_03]: may be a larger farm that employs their
own agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's basically, you know,
it probably looked a lot more complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: than than it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's not that steep of a
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you always have to strike a
balance between, you know, people want a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain level of sophistication because
they want good recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a data driven tool,
it does require, you know, some skills to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to, you know, to use it
effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Kevin, do you have any, did you hear
that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was breaking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the gist of it was I would say
98 percent of the acres that are run
[SPEAKER_00]: through ADAPTEN today are done through a
retail agronomist or a crop consultant
[SPEAKER_00]: type of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is, is that farmers want
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want, they request that second
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like doing their taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers aren't going to prepare
their own tax returns just because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nitrogen is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer wants another set of eyes and
they want proof and data to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers want to be environmentally
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have to do it at a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we marry both of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, but I would say the majority of
our users are crop consultant or retail
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomists.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
