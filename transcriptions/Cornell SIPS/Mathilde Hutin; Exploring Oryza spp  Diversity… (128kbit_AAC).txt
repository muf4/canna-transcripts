[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of my presentation is
Exploring the Reset Genus Diversity to
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for Noble Tartifactin-Dependent
Sources of Resistance Against Fonthumonas
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fonthumonas is a brown-negative
gamma-propylbacteria with a size of genome
[SPEAKER_00]: around 5 megalibands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This genus is composed by 27 species,
8 hepatovars, able to infect over 400
[SPEAKER_00]: species, bigots like cotton or cabbage and
cassava, and monocots like rice or banana
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these species can mix with different
diseases like mesophysis, cancer,
strife, and can infect different organs as
well as the stem of its follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this bacteria, many of the
predominance are involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a molecular syringe that allows
the transmission of specific effectors
[SPEAKER_00]: called type III effectors from the
bacterial stoplasm into the plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type III vision system is present and
essential for pathogenicity of many
[SPEAKER_00]: Fonthumonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crucial role of the type III
effectors was demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So among these type III effectors,
in Fonthumonas, we have the type II
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors for transcription, activation,
or life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fonthumonas species contain a variable
number of type II effectors, with some
[SPEAKER_00]: species like Fonthumonas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other species like Fonthumonas,
that can contain up to 28 type II
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was shown that some of these type
II effectors play a central role for
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, as illustrated here,
type C from XO is required for the legion
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for the type PTHA4 from Fonthumonas
C3, that's essential for the computer
[SPEAKER_00]: development on C2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these type effectors are able to
manipulate the host transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are structurally conserved with
incidental NLS domains that allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear localization, an activation domain
that allows the activation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, and a central domain that
is the recognition domain for the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA-specific binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this central domain is composed by a
sequence of repeats of 34 amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: near identical, where only change the
residues in position 12 and 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: called hypervariable de-residues,
or RBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this sequence of RBD that will
define the DNA-specific binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, according to the type code,
which is dated in 2009, each RBD will
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize specifically one nucleotide in
the target box in the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, an I will recognize
specifically an A, a G, a C, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have represented the
crystallographic structure of the type
[SPEAKER_00]: with the repetition in color, wrapped
around the double-strand of DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and interacting via the RBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This elucidation of the type code allows
the possibility to predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: value-informatic algorithm, the target
genes in the plant, providing that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the sequence of RBD and genomic data
available in the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the possibility to design an
artificial type effector to target our
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite genes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seen that some of these types
are major evidence effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, because they target specific genes,
called susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a susceptibility gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gene for which the induction is
essential for the disease development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know several susceptibility genes in
rice, which include newspaper and cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they grouped in two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first category is the category of
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sweet gene family, in use in rice
and in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: By example, monas, oraize, patoha,
oraize, and by example, monas,
[SPEAKER_00]: xymethes, patoha, oraize, and xymethes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sulfate transporter, sulfate 36,
will use in rice, by example, monas,
[SPEAKER_00]: oraize, patoha, oraize, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second category are susceptibility
genes and code for transcription effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for example, CSLOB1 in citrus,
and UPA20 in maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that zoncomonase needs to
induce susceptibility genes to lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, implicate that if we have a code
morphism in the box targeting by this
[SPEAKER_00]: type, altering the recognition,
it will lead to non-injection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility genes, and resistance by a
lot of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of the two genes,
say 13 and say 25, that was cloned in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rice as recessive resistance gene,
and it has shown that, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes correspond to the
susceptibility genes 11 and 213 that
[SPEAKER_00]: contain code morphism in their form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, plants have evolved from
promoter-containing boxes targeted by
[SPEAKER_00]: value factors upstream of particular gene
called executor gene, and the induction of
[SPEAKER_00]: this executor gene will lead to
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, we know only five executor
genes, two in paper and three in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: These executor genes do not include for
classical resistant gene, but for protein
[SPEAKER_00]: with unknown function, and that have two
or no similarity between each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two pathovars of zoncomonase or
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoncomonase pathovar or rice, pathovar or
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the causal agent of the bacterial
leaf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vascular bacteria enter via the
letters and colonize the plant via the
[SPEAKER_00]: xylembe cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second pathovar, zoncomonase or
rice pathovar or rice coli, is the causal
[SPEAKER_00]: agent of the bacterial leaf's trait,
and enter into the leaves via the stomach,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this bacteria is limited to the
mesophilic intercellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two diseases represent a major
threat for rice production, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in Asia and Africa, and resistance gene
are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, there's no resistance gene
available in rice against bacterial leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: streak, and there's eight genes,
eight resistance genes cloned against the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial leaf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, six of them are
dependent on the value factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this context, the aim of my PhD was
to identify novel value factor dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of resistance against zoncomonase
or rice pathovar or rice, via different
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy based on our knowledge of the
data effectors, and particularly on their
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to buy a specific target box in
the promoter of susceptibility or executor
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, and to their capacity to induce
strongly their target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, we developed three
independent projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was to search in the
genus diversity for loss of susceptibility
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second strategy used was to identify
other high-volume style effectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the RNA sequencing approach,
new executor gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've identified several executor genes,
responding to two different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the genes that we have updated,
and I will not talk about this part today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the last strategy was to
ignore executor resistance against exo and
[SPEAKER_00]: exocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first part, the suite family is
a family of susceptibility genes targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: by zonosporide and rize, and this family
and code for sugar transporter that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects of sucrose from the cell to
the apoplast, while it could be available
[SPEAKER_00]: for the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know about 20 genes that belong to this
family in rize, and all the number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clades, the clades three, were shown as
susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important of them is OS314,
as we know to be targeted by multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the strain base three, from your
kinapasso, you have calci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to illustrate the function of calci,
as a major appearance vector, here you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the chemical water-soaking lesion
provoked by exo on the rise after
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there's a
water-soaking lesion extended around the
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When calci is mutated in the strain base
three, there's no more water-soaking
[SPEAKER_00]: lesion, and when we add calci in the
mutant strain, there's restoration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility version of the type around
confrontation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this susceptibility gene, Suc14,
is also targeted by the strain My1 from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mali via TAD5, and we have a totally
distinct box in the promoter of this gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, finally, by two strains from
Philippine, by two different types,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-6sus3 and AVRSA7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that there's a convergence for
the evolution of this gene by strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes, in geographic regions and
in ages, reflects its crucial role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction, and hence, I'm interested in
the diversity of this promoter,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to identify polymorphism that
could affect the recognition of the target
[SPEAKER_00]: box by this style, and lead to
non-injection of Suc14 and a resistance by
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, I sequenced a foreign model
based on PCR product around the box
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted by this portal in the promoter of
Suc14, and this, for 132 wild and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated rice exceptions, representative
of the other genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I selected 30 varieties of the African
cultivated rice of Zagla-Beghima.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only cultivated in this small part
of West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 exceptions of the wild ancestor of
Zagla-Beghima of Zagla-Beghima,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zabarti, that is present only in Africa
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected three exceptions of another
African wild species, Orisa mangistaniata,
[SPEAKER_00]: and finally, 34 varieties of the
cultivated Asian species, Orisa platyba,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is cultivated in a large part of the
world, and known to be the two most
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have a part of the program
obtained after sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, this promoter actually is highly
conserved despite of the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: between the different Orisa species,
but I distinguish three patterns according
[SPEAKER_00]: to the presence of one polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first pattern was in all the Orisa
setiva assessed, in all the Orisa
[SPEAKER_00]: mangistaniata and two forms of the
Orisa-Barti species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third pattern was found in all the
cultivated African species of
[SPEAKER_00]: Zagla-Beghima, and in one third of the
ancestor Orisa-Bartai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back on this pattern later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the pattern two was only
observed in three exceptions of
[SPEAKER_00]: Orisa-Barti, and this pattern present the
deletion of 18 base pairs that overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: with the box targeted by ABIXA7 and TAL5,
making it a decondylate for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to assess if this deletion can confer
resistance to strain within the TAL5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: ABIXA7, I used the strain base three,
mutating in TALC, and transformed with an
[SPEAKER_00]: empty vector, TAL5 and ABIXA7,
that target the deletion, and TALC that
[SPEAKER_00]: target outside of the deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these strains were inflated on plants
that not contain the deletion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and on plants containing the deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here that the mutant strain
for TALC is no more able to induce disease
[SPEAKER_00]: on both exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have TALC, there's complementation
in both cases, but with TAL5 and ABIXA7,
[SPEAKER_00]: the target and the deletion, we have
complementation only when there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I next quantified the bacterial population
in the plant five days post infiltration,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the nucleation was related to the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that, again,
with TAL5 and ABIXA7, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: complementation of the mutant strain only
on the plant without deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we expected that because of the
deletion, ABIXA7 and TAL5 would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to induce SU14, and you can see here
that it's effectively the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In presence of the deletion, TAL5 and
ABIXA7 are no more able to induce SU14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude on this part, the 18-bay
sphere deletion confers resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: strains reliant on TAL5 and ABIXA7,
so we name this new resistance gene as
[SPEAKER_00]: A41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I then turn to the spectrum of the
resistance mediated by this resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you have a tree that represents
the diversity of our XO collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tree is based on the Tiloquist
UNTR antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, the Asian strains, here the
African strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I selected 36 strains in order to
represent as much as possible the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of our collection, so the strain
and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: These strains were inoculated on the
excision without deletion, on the excision
[SPEAKER_00]: with deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all able to cause disease on the
excision without deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the excision with deletion,
then XO41, you can see that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that have a great halo,
so here, here, here, are no more able to
[SPEAKER_00]: induce disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a conclusion, XO41 confers
resistance to 50% of the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this independently of their geographic
and genetic images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to the pattern three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to assess what happened with this
pattern, I cloned the PCR product and I
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, in fact,
in the pattern three, we have at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time the presence of the promoter without
deletion and the promoter with deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the OVIZAGLA-BELIMA contain present
the pattern three, contains two actions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I looked at the three
theory-level genome sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: OVIZAGLA-BELIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And curiously, I couldn't find these two
actions of the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to run for a biosequencing
of two excision of OVIZAGLA-BELIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you have 2.28 seconds containing
the promoter of 3.14, built from bioreg
[SPEAKER_00]: and aligned on the chromosome 11 of
OVIZAGLA-BELIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you can see that XO41 is present
in the two excision of OVIZAGLA-BELIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 3.14 with the deletion of the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there's a 3.2-KALB DNA fragment
duplicated in OVIZAGLA-BELIMA containing
[SPEAKER_00]: the promoter of 3.14 without deletion and
the first exome of 3.14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to confirm that XO41 is well-present in
OVIZAGLA-BELIMA, and to investigate what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in OVIZAGLA-BELIMA three
excisions, I designed primer to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically organize the promoter without
deletion and with deletion, and primer
[SPEAKER_00]: specific of the truncated 3.14 and 3.14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this genotyping by PCR confirmed first
that OVIZAGLA-BELIMA doesn't contain the
[SPEAKER_00]: truncated 3.14.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the contrary, you can see that all the
African species contain the duplication,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the OVIZA-BARTY that present the
pattern one after sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, pattern two and pattern three,
OVIZA-BARTY and OVIZAGLA-BELIMA,
[SPEAKER_00]: contain the resistancing of XO41 and were
assessed for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used the same strain that I used
before, and you can see here that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern one, TAL5 and AVI-C7 are able to
cause water-sucking lesion on the rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pattern two as pattern three are
resistant to strain relating to TAL5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: AVI-C7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pattern three, the case for OVIZA-BARTY
that present the pattern three and for
[SPEAKER_00]: OVIZAGLA-BELIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, another interesting thing is that
in the OVIZA-BARTY species, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of the three patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also looked at the distribution of the
patterns inside the diversity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three based on 200 species,
there are 35 SMT markers which represent
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity of the OVIZA-BARTY species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this species is divided
into two genetic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: OBAR1 that contain accession from West
Africa and OBAR2 that contain accession
[SPEAKER_00]: from Central and Austral Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the distribution of the
three patterns follow this genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and geography distribution as
all the patterns two and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three that contain the deletion are in
the same branch of OBAR1 from West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So according to this, I proposed an
apolitical model for the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet 14 in African rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the duplication would occur in
an ancestor of OVIZA-BARTY in Africa as
[SPEAKER_00]: this duplication is not present in
OVIZA-SATIMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the event of deletion would occur
after the duplication event and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: in West Africa leading to the pattern
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rare event of gene conversion would lead
to the pattern two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, OVIZA-BELIMA would have been
domesticated in West Africa from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern three as all the OVIZA-BELIMA
contain the duplication and XA-41.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a conclusion, we identified a new
resistance gene, XA-41, that confers a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum resistance against,
for example, monocular OVIZA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This demonstrates the potential to exploit
the diversity to identify resistance by
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of susceptibility via a simple
molecular screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in perspective, these results raise
several questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As sweet 14 is the only non-sensitive
target for African strain, we can ask
[SPEAKER_00]: whether PELC that was identified only in
African strains could result of a
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication of West African XO to break
down the XA-41 negated resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's remarkable to see that 50% of the XO
strains independently of their
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical and genetic images target the
same region in the promoter of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the strain that break down this
resistance, we can imagine that,
[SPEAKER_00]: as is the case for PELC, they target
another box in the sweet 14 promoter or
[SPEAKER_00]: they target other three genes and maybe
susceptibility genes that are not known
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And XA-41 would present a good tool to
identify strains that don't use this high
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted region and to study the diversity
of XO type vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, our result suggests that this
duplicated promoter doesn't interfere with
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and susceptibility,
but it cannot be excluded that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: function of this duplicated promoter,
for example, as a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will finish with the first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second project was to engineer executor
resistance against XO and XOC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this last year, some publications have
shown that it's possible to clone executor
[SPEAKER_00]: gene downstream of promoter-targeted
engineer to be targeted by different type
[SPEAKER_00]: vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first team engineered the promoter
of the paper executor gene BS-3 to be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized by sweet type vectors,
and they showed that the transitory
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of these sweet type vectors in
mucosal and thaliana lead to a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second study showed that the stable
transformation of the executor gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: executors given in rice, don't stream of
the promoter containing boxes organized by
[SPEAKER_00]: three associated type vectors and three
type vectors from XO, confine resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to BOSPATOVAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, we have few executor genes that
are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five executors screened in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wondered if other resistance genes,
like MVLMF, could also confine resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, to MONAS, and could be used
to engineer resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are dozens of resistance genes
cloned against the
[SPEAKER_00]: rice-blast-fungus-magnaporteur-rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this model we chose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, the interaction between
AVR1-O39 and P-O39.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, that when
manaporteur-rice A carries the AVR1 gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR1-O39, rice containing the LOCUS-P-O39
is resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the case in absence of
AVR-O39 or in absence of the LOCUS-P-O39
[SPEAKER_00]: in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LOCUS-P-O39 is composed by two genes,
RGA5 and RGA4, that encodes for NVLR
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In absence of the pathogen, RGA5 repress
the autoactive NVLR RGA4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recognition of AVR1-O39 by RGA5
suppresses the emission of RGA4 and lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to oligosensitivity response and
resistance in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in consequence, our strategy was to
make use AVR1-O39 by xanthomonasaurizetal
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors in order to see if the
resistance radiated by the recognition of
[SPEAKER_00]: these fungal effectors can also confer
resistance to xanthomonasaurizet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, I used transunicline carrying
the fungal AVR gene AVR1-O39.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stream of the P-O-S promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use as control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then detail was designed to target
specific P-O-Y-S promoter and transform in
[SPEAKER_00]: exo and exo-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this in order to assess if the specific
induction by the detail of our fungal AVR
[SPEAKER_00]: gene can lead to resistance in the P-O39
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So detail is the design of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I set by QPCR the ability of the
detail to induce specifically AVR1-O39.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that there's only
induction in presence of the detail in the
[SPEAKER_00]: two line of QDiK containing AVR1-O39.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the empty vector and the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this detail is also able to induce the
mid-aim portion of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is delivered by exo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with exo-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then exo carrying the detail on the
empty vector were infiltrated on the
[SPEAKER_00]: transunicline of Kitaki N.251.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrying the reporter gene with A or the
fungal AVR1-O39.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that the induction of
AVR1-O39 by the detail in exo in the pump
[SPEAKER_00]: containing P-O39 leads to a strong
reduction in the water-soaking lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this in comparison to all other
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have the result after
integration with exo-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the same reduction is
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I then measured the lesion length after
infiltration with exo containing the
[SPEAKER_00]: detail and the empty vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that in Kitaki,
the induction of AVR1-O39 leads to a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong reduction of the lesion length on
both lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I measured the bacterial
population after exo-C in the second part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see that when the
detail induces AVR1-O39, in the P-O39
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram, there's a strong reduction of the
amount of the bacteria in the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude, the recognition of the
fungal effector AVR1-O39 by P-O39 confers
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to
Bospatova-Oxanthomonasauridae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as RGA forms the autoactive NDLR,
we wondered if the direct induction of
[SPEAKER_00]: RGA4 by design in a tile could also lead
to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, I designed two details to
target specifically the promoter of RGA4.
[SPEAKER_00]: These details were transformed in exo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that in Pumbar that
do not contain the P-O39 locus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the three strains leads to water soaking
lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, in these three varieties that
contain the locus P-O39, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a strong reduction of the size of
the water soaking lesion when there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of RGA4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that in the P-O39
variety, the response is particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I next did leaf clipping inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the size of the
lesion observed confirm the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: result with here a strong reduction of the
lesion length in the P-O39 variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude, the RGA4, RGA5 negative
resistance that controls the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen's maniobacteria is also able to
control the vascular disease caused by exo
[SPEAKER_00]: and the non-vascular disease caused by
exoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another conclusion is that autoactive
forms of NDLR can be used for synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter flat resistance strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that these strategies are applicable
against many of the monas diseases in
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even for crop with no resistance in
cloned, if you know an aviolance
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors, triggering a strong resistance,
as we have shown that the transformation
[SPEAKER_00]: of an AVR gene downstream of a type vector
target box can also confirm resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this work was done in IRD in
Montpellier, in the UML interaction from
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-organism on German land,
directed by Valérie Vardier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank my two PhD
supervisors, Boris Schoenach and Ralph
[SPEAKER_00]: Kovnick, all those on the Monash team,
and especially Alvaro Pérez and Antoine
[SPEAKER_00]: Fran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank François Sabaud that
provided me the seed of the African
[SPEAKER_00]: species of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the genetic data on Orizalga
delima.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank also Thomas Croy and
Stella Cesari for the collaboration on the
[SPEAKER_00]: COSRT9 project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the GOG lab for their
welcoming since my arrival.
And thank you to all of you for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've talked about the sweet genes as
being susceptibility factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything known that does the
sweet genotype confer any positive thing
[SPEAKER_02]: on the rice plant, grain quality or
anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: And thereby, if you inhibit that,
does that have any negative effect on the
[SPEAKER_02]: rice plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question for some of these three
genes that they are expressed during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flooring and in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there's one mutant rice for one of
these three genes that present a low
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to have a role in rice
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the mutations that influence the
susceptibility also influence the
[SPEAKER_04]: expression of the gene in terms of the
plant development?
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I have no idea because we don't
check for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the normal development of the
plant, the gene is not constituted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: express and it's just during some part of
the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be kind of an important moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the lab-related accessions are all
related to the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitive is normal when yes,
when there's a deletion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And XA13 is also normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no trade-off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm thinking that the deletion in the
promoter doesn't affect the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it sufficient to fully activate the
gene so that you would have sort of a
[SPEAKER_03]: saturation effect with the bone?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of my hypotheses that maybe
the fact that there's this depletion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quantity of telefactors in the support
in genes could be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe the fact that there's less
induction could lead to less
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just sort of in general, I just
thought you followed up.
