[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to be here today to talk about
native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cover photo kind of shows the three
prongs of my work, which is looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape adaptability, propagation,
and production in containers for,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say new native plants
because they're not new to the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But new to the horticultural industry,
so to say novel native shrubs mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I started, or I guess
my work with natives started with my
[SPEAKER_03]: dissertation work on invasives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for my doctoral work, I looked at the
contributions of cultivars of Japanese
[SPEAKER_03]: barbarian winged euonymus to invasive
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the time, the state of
Connecticut was facing bans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were enacting a voluntary ban on
Japanese barberry cultivars with high
[SPEAKER_03]: fruiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were looking for safe
alternatives, particularly native plant
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of wanted to get away from
barberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was tired of the thorns and the
scratched arms and fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thorns will last for months under
your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may still have some coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the question was, you know,
can natives fill the gap left by Japanese
[SPEAKER_03]: barberry cultivars that are incredibly
tough and can grow in parking lot islands
[SPEAKER_03]: and high light, high heat, high pedestrian
pressure, salt runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can propagate and grow in containers
very easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you have native shrubs that can do
the same thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first plants that I looked at
was nine bark because it was a direct
[SPEAKER_03]: replacement for barberry, purple foliage
cultivars, yellow foliage cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably today, one of the few or only
direct replacements for purple barberry is
[SPEAKER_03]: still this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think of there's some purple,
red, and orange-leaved deer villas now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really more southern natives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at powdery mildew
susceptibility and the cultivars that were
[SPEAKER_03]: available at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had yellow foliage cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And purple foliage cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that the older cultivar
natives with smaller leaves was largely
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this paper actually is probably one of
my most cited papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very useful to not only plant breeders and
scientists, but also nursery growers and
[SPEAKER_03]: landscapers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from this work, a lot of breeding was
done to develop new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some of the new cultivars since
that study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them have natives as a
parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using that resistance to breed in for
better landscape plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is the cultivar Donna Mae at
the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens,
[SPEAKER_03]: which features a lot of native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into native plants, it's worth a
visit up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wrapping up the nine bark work,
I started to think about other native
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were a good number that were
widely used, very important landscape
[SPEAKER_03]: plants like winterberry holly and the
creeping juniper, viburnum dentatum,
[SPEAKER_03]: red twig dogwood that were popular,
important native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, it seemed like native plants
were being overlooked for landscape
[SPEAKER_03]: potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a trade show display showing
the proven winners here on your left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And American Beauty's native plants brand
on the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were a consumer, which display
would you choose from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really not the native plants
fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we didn't know how to grow them
in containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're smaller pots, how to force them
for display.
[SPEAKER_03]: Propagation was difficult, mostly done by
seed, which doesn't yield uniform crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seemed like there was a lot of
potential to develop new natives or
[SPEAKER_03]: additional natives that could be
adaptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the first things that we did is
we put native plants into native shrubs
[SPEAKER_03]: that were not commonly available or widely
used in a tough landscape site on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Yukon campus in the parking lot islands
alongside barberry and euonymus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was just one site,
and we had this replicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did the first round in 2010 with
those six natives up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did another round in 2012 to 2014 with
another eight native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And crimson pygmy barberry and compactus
euonymus as controls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we first put this study in,
I thought everything was going to die
[SPEAKER_03]: after the first winter and their barberry
and euonymus would be standing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This really pleasantly surprised that most
everything survived and performed well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we measured aesthetic quality and
survival and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a really a tough site when you
dug it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was largely backfill from the
construction of these doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hot, high light.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge commuter parking lot there
called W lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this site, we used another parking lot
for round two, part of another parking
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not much to support the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the aesthetic quality index
results for that first study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the crimson pygmy barberry
and euonymus here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was aesthetic quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the aesthetic quality in 2010,
2011, and 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several plants like the
sweet fern and the sweet gale that right
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the gate performed as well as the
invasives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And several of them that kind of lagged
behind were just as good as the barberry
[SPEAKER_03]: and euonymus by the third year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was make a good recommendation
that these would can certainly be
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives for barberry and euonymus in
tough sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about some of these
plants because with some of these plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the research a step further and
looked at propagation and production in
[SPEAKER_03]: containers, media and fertility and
shading and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk about a few of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll show you the results of the
second parking lot and talk about some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how it's going to flow.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Comtonia paragraina.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I saw some of these
natives on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I saw this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe it's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sweet fern is a really interesting
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pioneer plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fixes nitrogen in the soil through
these root nodules and the trachea
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria that fixes nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it comes in after a forest fire or
after a clearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it rejuvenates the soil for other
plants to then come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very adaptable to dry,
gravelly, nutrient deficient soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you see in a parking lot island or a
commercial landscape site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the plants in the parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the bus stop location.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is right next to the winged
euonymus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a nice dense plant with full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people say that it's not that
long lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is going into its sixth season.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets to that three to four foot height.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and compact, dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a wonderful fragrance.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the foliage, especially on a warm sunny
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it smells like cinnabon in the parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which you wouldn't expect, but a really
interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is kind of being used as a
hedgerow at Coastal Maine Botanical
[SPEAKER_03]: Gardens or a shrubby ground cover under
trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a neat parking lot at a Lowe's in
Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or kind of as a naturalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the sweet fern is a real
sweetheart plant for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem with it has been
propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to propagate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't produce a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds need smoke or fire to break
their dormancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't readily take stem cuttings,
softwood stem cuttings in the traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's largely propagated by digging up
sods, dividing the rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the first studies that I did as
an assistant professor leaving Barbary
[SPEAKER_03]: behind was look at media for doing rhizome
divisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used vermiculite and a fafford mix
and sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very easy to propagate from
divisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could take small two inch segments and
get plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually the plants that I
raised up and put in the parking lot
[SPEAKER_03]: island a couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still working with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an undergrad last year do some stem
cuttings from very young shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they get to be no more than three
inches tall coming up from the rhizome,
[SPEAKER_03]: and more recently shown that it'll work
from shoots as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very young stems root readily with an
IDA oxen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can make nice dense plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can even get resprouts after you
take cuttings from the rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the data from that work,
which is not yet published.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just showing that we use two different
propagation systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used an intermittent mist, just
straight putting it in the mist with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of a covering over it for
shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of like an upside down
flat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used a propagation dome,
a clear dome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mist worked a lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 98% rooting for Comtonia is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dome didn't do too bad, about 70%
rooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened with the dome was the tips
would dry out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as humid in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually promoted lateral
branching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got slightly larger plants with the
dome, but better rooting with the mist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could perhaps recommend rooting in
mist and pinching to get greater
[SPEAKER_03]: branching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we grew them out in containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 3,000, 1,000 to 3,000 IDA,
maybe a little bit higher, you can get 80%
[SPEAKER_03]: or more rooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've found a developing native ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk a little bit more about that
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have raised this interesting clone
of Comtonia that has a bluish cast to the
[SPEAKER_03]: foliage, a kind of a very uniform margin
to the leaf, and nice kind of branching
[SPEAKER_03]: and symmetry to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the University of Connecticut is
looking to patent this now to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another plant that also has scented
foliage is Myrica pencil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be Myrica gale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet gale is Myrica gale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Myrica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bayberry is now Morella.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is Myrica gale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, you'd find it around the edge
margins of lakes, streams, freshwater
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has this kind of, frosty lime green
foliage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's deciduous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a cousin of the bayberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the berries with the
candle wax on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more of a catkin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here it is growing in the parking lot
islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's crimson pygmy barberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very low plant, one to two feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has this kind of arching
candelabra-like habit to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stems are kind of a brown,
purply brown with yellow, white,
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow lenticels on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scented foliage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tends to be monicious or dioecious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clone we had in the parking lot was a
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the male catkins can be really showy
in early spring, very early spring here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some that we put near my house,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is two years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get a nice hedgerow,
low.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the parking lots, I've seen birds nest
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually in Rockland, Maine,
near Marina.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it trying to be used here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A landscape architect had a good,
novel idea there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cold, hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's found all the way up,
maybe even into Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the growers says that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to propagate, so I didn't
do a lot of studies with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tried it with Hormonin 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: It roots very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably go right from a cutting
into a number one in one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can prune it, shear it, and it's very
dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what growers like, something
that's fast to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Takes a typical bark peat sand media and
control release fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So northern bush honeysuckle, Deervilla
lanicera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw this on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the southern sessile folia and this
one as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in the parking lot islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as popular among nursery growers,
but it should be because it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: adaptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stays really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a terrific bee plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was one near my driveway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just sit and watch the bumblebees
all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has these clusters of tubular yellow
flowers at the tips of the shoots,
[SPEAKER_03]: reddish foliage on the new growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first year, they didn't look as
good because they came, this was in 2010,
[SPEAKER_03]: they came from the nursery and they hadn't
been spaced in a timely manner at the
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as we spread them out,
the shoots fell over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it got a poor visible rating,
but this basically, they just re-sprouted
[SPEAKER_03]: from the base.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing you can do with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can prune it back readily and have it
re-sprout and make a dense plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was year three.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we had the cultivar copper,
which tends to get really red new growths.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's copper right there at the Coastal
Maine Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is outside of a daycare center in
downtown Storrs, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is on the Yukon campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is at Coastal Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is that planting I was looking at
the bees at, so we can get a nice fall
[SPEAKER_03]: color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw a huge planting that,
bigger than I've ever seen on campus here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what building it was at,
but it was a big swath of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a parking lot out in
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using it a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The button bush is another one that when
people saw this in the parking lots,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were shocked that it would grow
because typically it's a plant that you
[SPEAKER_03]: find on the edge of water with its roots
submerged in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes native plants are adaptable
to a niche outside of where you find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in those areas, they maybe don't
compete.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll do fine in these tougher
areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where you see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't necessarily mean that they
can't be used in a landscape in a
[SPEAKER_03]: different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the case with button bush
because here it is in the bus stop parking
[SPEAKER_03]: lot island, doing quite well in a quick
draining, not too wet, but maybe offers a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of moisture soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of the typical use in a rain
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can do well in drier sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not completely dry, but it can do
quite well outside of its niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very desirable for its interesting
inflorescences, these golf ball sized
[SPEAKER_03]: white flower clusters that attract lots of
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these fruits kind of persist.
[SPEAKER_03]: They turn a reddish and then a black,
and they'll persist into the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very easy to propagate from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need any cold stratification or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of diversity from seed
and not so desirable diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes different leaves, different
habits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were a designer, this may not be
so desirable for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some cultivars of this,
which is what's really important for this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to make it in the nursery trade to
have a little bit more symmetry and
[SPEAKER_03]: stability or predictability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Sputnik, which is an older
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cultivar Sugar Shack, which is a
really good cultivar, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: compact, three to four feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are some new ones that are not as
well tested as Sugar Shack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the American Filbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Mark right here in the parking
lot island.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a wild plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just showing the size,
because he's about six foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a nice fall color.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two native Filberts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the American Filbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the Beaked Filbert,
which is Corallus cornuta.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Corallus cornuta is the plant that I
wanted for the parking lot islands,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I thought it had a more finer
texture, a little bit more ornamentally
[SPEAKER_03]: pleasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're very difficult to distinguish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what I got from the nursery,
American Filbert, which we realized about
[SPEAKER_03]: a year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the burning bush right there next
to it, this nice kind of mix of fall
[SPEAKER_03]: foliage color.
[SPEAKER_03]: The American Filbert has this ruffled
Invalucar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did find, from raising some seed of
this, a compact form called Little Philly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So still working on propagation of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Filberts are not so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did do a study with the Beaked
Filbert that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Beaked Filbert is the easiest way to
distinguish it from the American Filbert
[SPEAKER_03]: is by the Invalucar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's shaped more like an Invalucar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like a duck beak versus kind of
the ruffled shirt sleeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it at the Minnesota Panic Garden
or Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one tends to be a little bit more
in the colder areas than the American.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they certainly overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other ways you can tell the
American Filbert apart from the Beaked
[SPEAKER_03]: Filbert.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fall color, the Beaked gets more of a
yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know these are wild shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cat can size.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they both produce the edible nut,
the Filbert nut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at several difficult to root
natives, the New Jersey T.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the Beaked Filbert, Northern Bush
honeysuckle, and Viburnum acerifolium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that you can get pretty good
rooting if you take cuttings in July,
[SPEAKER_03]: treat them with at least 3,000 parts per
million in IBA, you can root the Beaked
[SPEAKER_03]: Filbert pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we took the plants from this
study and some of the others and put them
[SPEAKER_03]: in a container production study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was looking at shale as a media
amendment, trying to recreate those dry,
[SPEAKER_03]: gravelly soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see this in along the sides of the
roads in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew well in all media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can use a standard bark peat sand
to grow nice looking Beaked Filberts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another plant that was not in the
parking lot study but was in these
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation studies was Maple leaf
Viburnum, Viburnum acerifolium.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great shade plant, dry,
shady conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a highly sought after plant for the
foliage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this Maple leaf looking foliage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets wonderful fall color.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a seedling in the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the natural history descriptions
of these plants are beautiful writing
[SPEAKER_03]: about this plant in this kind of ghostly
fall pinkish-white-yellow color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really sought after by
nurserymen as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very hard to propagate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they buy it in as rooted cuttings or
they buy it in as sod bare root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hard to propagate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the typical Viburnum flowers,
clusters of small white flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pink in buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you get pink buds and white
flowers at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And blue black fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did this plant as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did single node cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also tried two node cuttings
and had 100% rooting with two node
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the trick with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is when people are collecting
native plants from the wild, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to readily get a vegetation shoot
where you can take two node cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see a single node,
a pair of leaves, and then a flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that roots not as well, more in the
like, 50%, 60%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, if you give a plant time in
container production, you may find taking
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings from container plants will yield
better results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you'll get vegetative shoots
when you're growing a plant in a bark peat
[SPEAKER_03]: sand mix with high fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll go more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can take cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found two nodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to see, but there are two
nodes on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the grow out after winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we told growers that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they're trying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also looked at pruning to try to
yield a more dense plant in a pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people like to get plants that have
nice, rounded, uniform canopy in a
[SPEAKER_03]: container, not kind of a pigtail in a pot
like a lot of natives look.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can prune these plants as well
to get a more uniform height to width
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the second study, the parking
lots, which were established in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this year, we had heavy deer pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used that as a measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We evaluated deer browse or deer herbivory
based on the rating system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you can see natives like the
prunus, pumila variety, depressa,
[SPEAKER_03]: the creeping sand cherry, elderberry,
the gray dogwood and round leaf dogwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a spice bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had blueberry as kind of a pseudo
control and Virginia rose and sweet bells
[SPEAKER_03]: with the same two invasive controls.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blueberry is a plant that from day one
has been popularized as an alternative for
[SPEAKER_03]: the burning bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of mixed reports on how
well it establishes in a tough landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It likes acidic soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while it's drought tolerant once
established, it requires, I find,
[SPEAKER_03]: regular watering to get it established.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't just put it in the ground and
you set it and forget it like a burning
[SPEAKER_03]: bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of in there as let's see
how it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't do that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the lowest survival rates after two
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a little bit of deer browse,
actually, and not a great aesthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas plants like this unknown plant,
the sweet bells, eubotris racemosa,
[SPEAKER_03]: used to be Lakota.
[SPEAKER_03]: We racemosa did really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia rose did well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dogwoods had quite a bit of deer
browse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with the spice bush,
not the greatest survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good amount of deer browse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about this plant sweet
bells and about the creeping sand cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: and a couple of other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the sweet bells.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has bell-shaped flowers with a very
light fragrance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks kind of like a blueberry,
but a little bit denser than a blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot tougher than a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy to establish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are the plants in a parking lot
island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets some plants, some ecotypes get
really nice red fall color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to propagate from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 to 88% with no hormone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very easy to propagate,
which is good for grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows fast in a pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shear it and stick those cuttings
at any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a shade production study with these
plants and a couple of other species and
[SPEAKER_03]: found you can grow them right under full
sun or under 40% shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will make a nice kind of height
to width uniform ratio with a good number
[SPEAKER_03]: of shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are one-gallon size pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this study, we also looked at hobble
bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the propagation study, we looked at
hobble bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one wasn't in the parking lot
islands because it's a shade plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like the maple leaf viburnum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It likes cool climates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It likes moist soils, but well-drained.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of picky, but it's a gorgeous
plant, a highly sought after plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets these red fruits, these big
leaves, fuzzy leaves, a little bit fuzzy,
[SPEAKER_03]: these white lace cap flowers, fuzzy buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really sought after among native
plant enthusiasts, very difficult to
[SPEAKER_03]: propagate from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that easy from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never tried it, but that's what I
hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if we just came across the
right plant in Massachusetts that roots,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we rooted it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had 70% rooting with 3,000,
1,000 to 8,000 parts per million IBA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were short little shoots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one little note, because that's all you
can get off of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were these short little shoots
that were barely in the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these leaves eventually just dried up
and came right off over the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the outgrowth the following
spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were potted up before they leafed out
or as they were starting to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here they're growing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we put this plant in that shade
study, so a typical bark peat sand mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they definitely benefit from growing
in shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had leaf burn in full sun, even some
leaf coloring, discoloring in 40% shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can get a nice looking container
plant with shade, 70% shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: The creeping sand cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it in the parking lot island,
so you almost can't tell that it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the outside landscaping crew couldn't
tell that it was there, so they mowed over
[SPEAKER_03]: it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a great low, less than a foot
plant with these kind of linear leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: that emerge a little bit after the flowers
or just as the flowers are emerging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a classic kind of rosaceae
flower, five petaled white flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver undersides to the leaves that can
get kind of a red burgundy fall color.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in our lilac garden on the Yukon
campus over some slate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very low growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the native knoll that we call it
at my house, this rocky area.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were one, two, there were three,
maybe five of these from a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was it maybe last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great kind of day surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a plant or along the edge of a
driveway or something where you get hot
[SPEAKER_03]: baking sun and it'll do just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of the other view of the
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my son several years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it's kind of like a
driveway planting, just kind of creeping
[SPEAKER_03]: over for a rock garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to root cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually cuttings from a
Canterbury horticulture nursery in
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get nice dense one gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a cultivar that Mark developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark's sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Yukon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed prunus pumula variety depressa
and prunus susquehannae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a creeping plant with a little bit
larger leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same white flowers and red fall color
grows really well in a container.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the university I think is looking to
patent this plant as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Native plants that behave well in a
landscape and still offer wildlife
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits, I think is what the nursery
industry is looking for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant deerberry is one that I've been
working on recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a paper coming out Native
Plants Journal this fall on micro
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So deerberry has a pretty broad native
range.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be really big and it can get more
compact like this specimen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the blueberry group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't produce sweet tasting
fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're edible, but not really palatable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is being used in blueberry breeding
to introduce kind of exotic flavors and
[SPEAKER_03]: colors and upland adaptation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's drought, more drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of at my house by a rock
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are some of the ornamental
features.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from the publication, which is why
it's all labeled up like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get these kind of star like
flowers in abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the fruit is usually starts out
greenish to blue, and then it turns these
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of burgundy, orangey colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get nice red fall color like the
blueberries do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not root well from cuttings at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we tried first with poor
root systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we thought, let's try it in
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at different iron
supplements in tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: because sometimes the leaves look the
little prurotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did rooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it propagates, you know, with 80%
success from micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one way to go about it for
breeders or growers looking for this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they are acclimating in a salad tray,
acclimating to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still working with native plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a grad student right now looking at
pollinator visitation on native shrubs and
[SPEAKER_03]: their cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So native plants, when I first started
working with them, they were desirable as
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives to invasives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now when the pollinator concern and
worry hit, it was all about, we need
[SPEAKER_03]: native plants for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you started to hear some groups
saying that the cultivars of native plants
[SPEAKER_03]: were not as supportive of pollinators as
the wild type species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that concerns growers and
that's not really based in scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a study, we collected some
native shrubs, species and their cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: and put them in a planting behind our
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my master's student,
Jacob, and he's counting insect
[SPEAKER_03]: visitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this work is wrapping itself up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll get this out soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the cultivars are very good at
supporting pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few that have dramatic changes
like a flower color that maybe attract a
[SPEAKER_03]: different suite of pollinators,
but not always.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of the cultivars that just
exhibit a more compact habit attract just
[SPEAKER_03]: as many pollinators of the same type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some even have greater floral density
and attract more pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I'm working on is looking at
developing local native plants for native
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at local ecotypes and which
ones exhibit the best ornamental qualities
[SPEAKER_03]: and adaptability, because this is a
Eubotrus racemosa from Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a Eubotrus racemosa from
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one clearly has more, you know,
I think Pride's Corner would be more
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in picking up this plant than
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're certainly more interested in
growing them vegetatively so they can
[SPEAKER_03]: offer a uniform crop than from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So which is not, it just germinates well,
but they're itty bitty bitty seeds with
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a pain to deal with them
in a plug tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it by 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really enjoyed your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed most, I mean maybe 80% of the
plants require acid soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the whole world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in this part of New York for
an alkaline soil, pH 70.75 to 80.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of those will not do well at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you wanted to look at some of
the pH issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will do fine, but many of the
ones you just mentioned are not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, maybe that should be tested,
you know, because maybe they will tolerate
[SPEAKER_03]: outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you put them in and they
haven't done well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here according to the native maps,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that with native plants,
it is going to be a regional issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there are some plants that
have a really broad range, but that's one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the issues with the whole patenting
cultivar process and trying to get our
[SPEAKER_03]: tech transfer people to realize that you
can't necessarily market these plants
[SPEAKER_03]: across, you know, the nursery industry
like you can a barberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with native selections, it's going to
be a more regional focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like even on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that on the western half of
Connecticut, they have more limestone
[SPEAKER_03]: soils as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the plants might do okay like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't include the Spirea, but the
Tomantosa is being looked at in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Midwest and they've done actually I think
some ph studies in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe with that plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tomantosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe some of these others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it has been a more kind of ph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consider that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the pollinators, were there native
and non-native pollinators?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, we looked at the honey bees
and which is not native and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he looked at, I mean, for
something, I think he had about he has
[SPEAKER_03]: about 12 insect groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had like hover flies and mining bees
and bumblebees, honey bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he had smaller groupings,
you know, like other flies and sweat bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had maybe three or four bee groups
and then a couple of fly groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he had like an other group.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the butterflies and moths group,
which you didn't see that much of,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he didn't look at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Well, like, like with Aronia,
for example, we looked at a wild
[SPEAKER_03]: representative Aronia and then we looked
at two compact cultivars of Aronia,
[SPEAKER_03]: which really didn't have a change in
flower color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no significant difference in
the insect visitation on a compact form.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, with clethora, we looked at Ruby
spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at a wild type and then we
looked at hummingbird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hummingbird actually produces more
flowers per square in the area of plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had more pollinators in some of the
insect category.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Ruby spice differed in a couple of
maybe one situation, not much difference
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at potentilla, the wild
potentilla, gold finger and pink beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw differences there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw differences between the purple and
the green nine bark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some differences with hydrangea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at Annabelle, which is largely
sterile florets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nursery industry tends to be fairly
conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering what successes you had in
introducing these native shrubs to the
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery industry and what methods you've
used to try to attract them to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how am I bringing these plants to the
growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did have a grant that allowed me to
propagate and give them plants to trial
[SPEAKER_03]: and recruit growers to an advisory group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I worked with about five growers
directly, Prides Corner Farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinderberry Hort, Planner's Choice,
Broken Hour, which is more of kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: specialty plant design build and Summer
Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I gave them the plants to trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I repeatedly asked for feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I visited the nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think probably about three or four
species have been added.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they like the prunus pumila.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like, I have a viburnum lantanoides.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sorry, not lantanoides.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, I don't know if they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave that to a couple of specialty
nurseries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the viburnum cassanoides or nudum
cassanoides.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, America Gale, they're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had been growing Comtonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm holding a grower workshop this
winter for the new propagation method of
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully hands on, we'll dig sod four
shoots and let them, the propagators stick
[SPEAKER_03]: the cuttings and then see where to plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, but they are like the big
nurseries are looking for selections of
[SPEAKER_03]: natives now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Prides and Monrovia and like the Bailey
and Spring Meadow, they are looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have unique germplasm of a
native, I think that's the way they wanna
[SPEAKER_03]: go with a cultivar selection because the
consumer wants a named plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small group of consumers that want
a wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think about three or four species and
that the species may vary slightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the plants that I really like is
round leaf dogwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's showing a lot of promise with
drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just one grower was just not
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of the growers got the
prunus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what he did with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden now he's got
people asking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask him and I said, well,
go try this grower who actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they asked me where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't I give it to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I said, oh, I think Canterbury
still has some.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went and got it from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a while to catch on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly takes a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're like, oh yeah,
we should be growing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are asking for that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you say that cultivated plants are
significant in maintaining insect or
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator populations?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they certainly will support nectar
foraging pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've looked at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't looked at the underside of the
leaves for the larvae or the caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that certainly could be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could look at night foraging
pollinators as well, which Jacob's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: night person and I've recruited someone
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just wanted to look at a little bit
just try to provide a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: science to people as they make their
decisions and what's the best for their
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, if you're doing restoration,
you don't want to necessarily put ruby
[SPEAKER_03]: spice in, not that it didn't derive as a
sport and may be out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they certainly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of non-natives can as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they can support natives quite
well, insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: More questions, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
