[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're going to have a panel
presentation, and I would like to call up
[SPEAKER_04]: to the front desk, please, those who will
be part of this panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Chris Loesch, Dr. Nyberg, Dr. Vians,
Dr. Hoffman, and Dr. Quaitens,
[SPEAKER_04]: please, if you would come join us here in
the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get ready for this next session,
which is entitled Researching Hemp's
[SPEAKER_04]: Potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the state of New York, which we will
highlight some success stories and discuss
[SPEAKER_04]: the path forward for the work that they've
done so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, while they're coming up to the front,
I hope you've noticed on your seats,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might have found three by five cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of this discussion, I will
introduce each person, and they will speak
[SPEAKER_04]: for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But while you are listening to them,
as questions emerge, please write them on
[SPEAKER_04]: your three by five card, and then raise
your hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Julie Suarez and Tim Sweeney,
who will pick up your cards while you're
[SPEAKER_04]: writing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So continue to fill out extra cards and
turn them in as questions arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: In case we don't get to your question
during this panel session, please put your
[SPEAKER_04]: name and an email address or a phone
number on the card as well, and we'll make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that we get back to you with an
answer to your question, even if it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't happen today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please use those three by five cards to
fill out questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Raise your hand as soon as you're ready to
have that question picked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have someone pick it up on the side
and bring them on up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't get your question today,
however, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now I would like to start with our
presenters on this panel this afternoon,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'll introduce each person as we go
along.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll speak for a few minutes,
and then we'll move to the next.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our first speaker is Chris Loge from
the Department of Agriculture and Markets,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he will speak about the current state
and federal regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_04]: surrounding industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to be here
today and talk with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just by way of starting out,
you know, when I came to the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and Markets, a little over
three years ago, I guess it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: this program was not on the horizon and
not something that I ever thought I'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been quite a learning curve and
really exciting opportunity, and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the opportunity you've spoken
to so many folks about industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past year or so, and now today
being able to put some faces to those
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to talk a little bit about
the regulatory stage, and then I'll pass
[SPEAKER_00]: this along to the other presenters,
and later on, Scott Weiner and I will talk
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically about sort of where the
regulations are headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically on the federal level,
I think we all know that the 2014 Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill authorized State Departments of
Agriculture and Institutions of Higher
[SPEAKER_00]: Education to run these research pilot
programs in states where there was a law
[SPEAKER_00]: that allowed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the very important things
for everybody to keep in mind on this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that the Farm Bill reads is that
it allows us to do research pilot programs
[SPEAKER_00]: versus commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the other hand, there's not really
a definition of a research pilot program
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Farm Bill, nor is there a
definition of what commercialization is,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think we have some room to work
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a certain amount of
regulatory discretion there that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is helpful to us as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of the second building block,
if you will, on the federal side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: is the omnibus budget bill of 2016,
and that omnibus budget bill prohibited
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA from using their program
appropriations for enforcement efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, that does give us a little bit
of discretion there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that we need to
be clear on also, though, is just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't use enforcement force,
their appropriation on enforcement doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily make everything legal,
but on the other hand, there's again a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of regulatory discretion that we have,
and I think it circles back around to what
[SPEAKER_00]: the Farm Bill says, where as long as we're
working on a research pilot program,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on good firm ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final piece or building block on
the federal side is a program guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: document that came out in July of 2016
from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice, the Food and Drug
Administration, and USDA, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: document provides some very general
guidance on what is and what is not okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, we have to keep in mind it's a
program guidance document.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not necessarily have force of law
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a little bit more onto our purview
here on the state side, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I alluded to this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has a very, very broad
definition, and what we've seen selected
[SPEAKER_00]: or awarded so far are projects that focus
on the agronomic characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, processing, the beginnings of some
manufacturing technology, but another
[SPEAKER_00]: really important thing that I think we're
all very, very interested in, and we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see some data built on, is some
economics on the cost of production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the returns on the crop as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're looking going forward in the
future when we're looking at projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to want, you know,
well thought out research questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: add to sort of the foundation of this
industry and give producers the
[SPEAKER_00]: information they need from the agronomic
side as well as the economic side,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also very, very important is that we
want to have processing and manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: coming online sort of in the same
proportions, if you will, as we have
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look a little bit at the history of
how this crop progressed in Canada over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 20 years is when Canada legalized
hemp, you had a great deal of production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as production came up ahead of the
manufacturing being in line, they did see
[SPEAKER_00]: prices decrease, and so over time that has
sort of equalized and it's become a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good crop up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to keep all these different
things in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: As has been said a lot today and this
morning, we've been trying to be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very creative in the division of plant
industry on how we handle this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying very, very hard to take an
open-minded approach, and I think we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been very, very flexible so far with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all intentions of continuing that
as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really want to have as we go
forward under the current regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints that we have from the federal
perspective is some level of safety for
[SPEAKER_00]: our participants or our program partners
as well as for the department and other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of think of it as we're trying to
build a program that is, for all intents
[SPEAKER_00]: and purposes, a safe harbor for the
participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really very committed, again,
to position the industry for the day when
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal regulatory environment
relaxes, and so those are sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophical pieces that we're using as
we frame this program out going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next speaker this afternoon is Dr. Don
Vians, and Don is the Associate Dean and
[SPEAKER_04]: Director of Academic Programs in the
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
[SPEAKER_04]: at Cornell in addition to being a plant
breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Don has firsthand experience
regarding the paperwork that is involved
[SPEAKER_04]: in starting up a new trial, and he has
some photos to share with us of the first
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp trial here at Cornell, and this crop
was planted at the Cornell University
[SPEAKER_04]: Agricultural Experiment Station in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Don, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Catherine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this last summer we did receive some
funding from the New York State Department
[SPEAKER_05]: of Agriculture and Markets to compare
varieties of industrial hemp for the New
[SPEAKER_05]: York conditions, and as you see on the
slide there, the first group of three
[SPEAKER_05]: names there are those of us on our
research project.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually a forage breeding research
project, but we got into industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: research just this past growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second list of three names
are people up at the Cornell Experiment
[SPEAKER_05]: Station at Geneva, and they've become very
much interested in industrial hemp as
[SPEAKER_05]: well, so we're forming a bigger team as
time goes along.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to restrict my remarks just to
the comparison of industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties for right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a list of the types of
characteristics that we're interested in
[SPEAKER_05]: that might expand as we get into the next
growing season, but basically biomass
[SPEAKER_05]: yield for the grain types of varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, of course, want to look at the yield
of the grain or the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fiber types of varieties we'll be
looking at the fiber, various quality
[SPEAKER_05]: components such as fatty acids,
proteins, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And through the growing season,
especially after establishment,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's important that there's a good thick
plant stand density, and so we'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at that just a few weeks after
planting and throughout the growing
[SPEAKER_05]: season, because without that good stand of
hemp, the stand is just not going to yield
[SPEAKER_05]: its maximum production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's a very important component of
the whole process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be looking at plant height through
the growing season, flowering date,
[SPEAKER_05]: any kind of factors that might inhibit
maximum production such as diseases and
[SPEAKER_05]: insects, weed pressure, anything,
we'll be making observations on these
[SPEAKER_05]: trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the fiber types especially,
we'll be separating out the two major
[SPEAKER_05]: types of fiber that have different
industrial uses, the bast and the herd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we went through the growing season,
we did have to go through some regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: channels.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time we realized that we were
having funding to do these trials,
[SPEAKER_05]: then we had to go through a tandem process
of regulatory channels there, not only at
[SPEAKER_05]: the state, but mostly at the federal
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of slowed things down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, by the time we had the final
import permit for obtaining seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was actually at the end of August and
early September.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, way too late to be able to
plant any trials to get meaningful data.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my research crew decided to plant a
few varieties in a small trial anyway just
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we could get some experience on
establishing a trial so that this next
[SPEAKER_05]: growing season, in fact, a month from now
when we plant larger trials, we'll have
[SPEAKER_05]: some experience doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was really kind of interesting to
watch this plant stands of these trials as
[SPEAKER_05]: they were planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two separate trials with two
different planters.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was the forged seeder that we used on
our forged breeding project that just
[SPEAKER_05]: barely has a little bit of soil over top
of the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, very shallow depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: In contrast to that was the grain drill
that our small grains breeding project
[SPEAKER_05]: uses that places the seed usually at a
better depth, three quarters to maybe one
[SPEAKER_05]: inch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right after the, well, you remember last
growing season, it was just really dry
[SPEAKER_05]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, the crew irrigated the trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: But soon after that, we got a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the result of that was crusting of the
ground, a layer of crust right at the
[SPEAKER_05]: surface that wasn't bad for this low depth
of seeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the grain drill, it was quite a
contrast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very few plants came up through that crust
with that deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: A month later, you can see that we had a
pretty nice stand with the shallow
[SPEAKER_05]: planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the grain drill that was deeper,
the stand would not have been very
[SPEAKER_05]: productive if this were a complete growing
season that we went through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it doesn't mean that the grain drill
is not the proper type of equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it means that we have to be really
careful with the depth of planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was planted so late,
it was interesting to watch these young
[SPEAKER_05]: seedlings go into the fall and to find out
what temperatures would actually kill
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't until well into November
when the temperatures got down to maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: the mid-20s at nighttime that we started
seeing plants kill out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, as you can see here,
this is a few weeks later in early
[SPEAKER_05]: December when they're totally dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this next season, in fact,
in another month or so, we'll be planting
[SPEAKER_05]: three locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, we were planning just to plant
at Ithaca, but now that both Chris and
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry Smart have gained interest in this,
they will have two trials up at Geneva and
[SPEAKER_05]: two different soil types.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, essentially, three locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be right in our home base so that
we can keep a careful watch on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: almost on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: At each location, we'll have two types of
trials side by side.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a trial with only the fiber
types, and then a trial with the grain
[SPEAKER_05]: types and the dual types for both fiber
and grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll be able to make proper
comparisons of those types of varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were fortunate in that there was a
student at SUNY Coboskill who is a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: science major, and she's due to graduate,
but she needs an internship experience in
[SPEAKER_05]: order to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, she learned of our hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Project and contacted me about a month and
a half ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: She came up for a visit about four weeks
ago with Julie, Jamie, and myself on a
[SPEAKER_05]: research project, and things really
clicked off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she'll be coming to do the
internship, and what we plan for her to do
[SPEAKER_05]: is to focus mostly on the industrial hemp
trials to keep a watch on it, to collect
[SPEAKER_05]: data, make any observations that we need
to have on those trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it'll be a win-win situation for us,
but also for her in that she'll be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: learn a lot about production of industrial
hemp through this experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie Crawford on our project has already
been communicating with various people
[SPEAKER_05]: around the college in hopes of developing
a website that we can begin putting some
[SPEAKER_05]: information there for various
stakeholders, and perhaps Amelia,
[SPEAKER_05]: our intern, will contribute to placing
some materials on that website once it's
[SPEAKER_05]: up and running.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that there will be plenty of
people who are interested in seeing these
[SPEAKER_05]: trials through the summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, at both Geneva and Ithaca,
we will accommodate any tours that people
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And last thing that I might comment is
that as the summer went on and we began to
[SPEAKER_05]: be involved in the research process,
it was interesting that not a week went by
[SPEAKER_05]: until well into the fall months that at
least one grower across New York State
[SPEAKER_05]: contacted me and expressed interest in
growing industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we had a few people from the
industry contact me and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to do something as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not quite ready for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we want to keep close to home,
but with the additional funding,
[SPEAKER_05]: we do have plans to expand that across New
York State because we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: microclimates and a lot of soil types to
evaluate these varieties in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Katherine, I'll end right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next speaker is Dr. Chris Nyberg,
who is Dean of the School of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: at SUNY Morrisville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Nyberg will be sharing with us
some reflections on how SUNY Morrisville's
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp partnership this past year with JD
Farms has opened the door for new teaching
[SPEAKER_04]: and research and student involvement at
SUNY Morrisville.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Dr. Nyberg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Katherine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We jumped at the opportunity when JD Farms
approached us when the opportunity for
[SPEAKER_06]: universities to apply for the research
license came about, there was no funding
[SPEAKER_06]: supporting the research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, without the partnership with industry,
with JD Farms, we would not have been able
[SPEAKER_06]: to do what we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it was an exciting opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our research was totally funded by our
farming partner, both laboratory equipment
[SPEAKER_06]: to support some of the soil science
research, all of the field operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has had an effect across a number
of our academic programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morrisville's 100% teaching institution,
our faculty have 100% teaching
[SPEAKER_06]: appointment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have a lot of applied research
activity that we try and involve our
[SPEAKER_06]: students in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when the research questions came up,
we were looking initially at the first
[SPEAKER_06]: year of production.
[SPEAKER_06]: JD Farms is an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the first year was looking at various
manure nutrient sources with four plots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Had some issues that confounded that
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other opportunities, our renewable
energy program wanted to look at biodiesel
[SPEAKER_06]: production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our students just produced their first
test batch of biodiesel this last week
[SPEAKER_06]: with seeds grown last year at JD Farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the course of the year and this
winter, the research questions have
[SPEAKER_06]: expanded to greenhouse growing for baby
greens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, again, came from JD Farms'
interest and their partnership with Satter
[SPEAKER_06]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our culinary program and our
horticulture students have been doing some
[SPEAKER_06]: baby green production in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, some test tastings in the
culinary program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's been an exciting opportunity
across multiple curriculums.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of large animal science
programs, equine and dairy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the next few years, we're looking at
the bedding opportunities for that as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I have just a few slides showing our
production from last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the original study question was
nutrient sources using the manure for the
[SPEAKER_06]: organic farm application last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: At what application rates?
[SPEAKER_06]: This was seeding day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was difficult to get to this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: The permit application was, the
application for getting the research
[SPEAKER_06]: approval through the DEA took a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: The DEA seemed very aggressive initially.
[SPEAKER_06]: A local was more difficult than federal.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest and most onerous piece was the
request to have the seed after importation
[SPEAKER_06]: under armed guard until it was integrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to put it in the ground,
which became costly and onerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when the seed finally came,
we had a first dry day after it arrived.
[SPEAKER_06]: After five days of armed guard observation
on the seed, we were able to put it in the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground on July 3rd, which happened to be a
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you should see that Sunday,
4th of July weekend, it was a family
[SPEAKER_06]: affair with Dan and Mark from JD Farms and
Mark's wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dr. Jen Gilbert-Jenkins, our
agronomist from Morrisville and her
[SPEAKER_06]: children.
[SPEAKER_06]: By July 7th, just four days, seedlings
were up.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were planted with a typical John
Deere grain drill.
[SPEAKER_06]: July 26th, you're seeing pretty good
growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: July 29th, we've got some flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was irrigated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very dry summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: JD Farms invested in an irrigation unit to
ensure the survival of the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: August 9th, you're seeing quite a lot of
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a total of 30 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our agronomy students, in collaboration
with Dr. Gilbert-Jenkins, were doing soil
[SPEAKER_06]: testing throughout the summer and fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were able to harvest sometime later
in September with conventional combine
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment in collaboration with JD Farms,
who worked with GN4T Farms to do the
[SPEAKER_06]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, year one, grain yield varied.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quite variable from 11 to 28
bushels per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was quite a lot of weed pressure
confounding the manure applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had been former organic hayfield that
was tilled to put this in just prior to
[SPEAKER_06]: planting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Average yield ended up 16 bushels per
acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fiber was baled, a total of 36
large and nine small square bales from the
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, you're seeing that there was quite a
lot of weed contamination in the sand and
[SPEAKER_06]: some pest issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, production suggestions in terms of
nitrogen per acre, and this is one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: research questions that we were planning
to look on in the future, definitely based
[SPEAKER_06]: on soil type and going with conventional
fertilizers, not just the organic manure
[SPEAKER_06]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, you're seeing that there were pests
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard from other states that
Japanese beetles are an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although our stand had quite a lot of
Japanese beetles in the stand,
[SPEAKER_06]: we didn't see pest damage to the hemp
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw it on the weeds that happened to be
in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the baby green question will be looked
at going forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pest issues, although we didn't have a
pest issue in terms of pressure on the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, we're looking at that going forward
and want to look at the bedding
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities as well as continuing the
biofuel opportunities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's where I mentioned expanding the
nitrogen research in organic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_06]: for more precise application rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there definitely needs to be
collaboration for farms statewide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of soil types and nitrogen yield
response.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, the plan is to continue
collaborating with JD Farms and go to 100
[SPEAKER_06]: acres with both some till and no-till
practices in those 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, a reminder, please, if you have
questions, write them on your 3x5 cards
[SPEAKER_04]: and hold them in the air so that we can
collect them and bring them up front.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next speaker is Interim President Jay
Quaintance from Sullivan Community
[SPEAKER_04]: College.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his community college has just
received a permit for industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a really interesting partnership
proposed with a local not-for-profit that
[SPEAKER_04]: serves the needs of autistic children.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we would love to hear from you,
Dr. Quaintance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Catherine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you all for coming out to hear
what's going on around the state with the
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp project.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are very excited at SUNY Sullivan to
partner with the Center for Discovery,
[SPEAKER_07]: which, as was mentioned, is an educational
and medical facility that serves the needs
[SPEAKER_07]: of students and individuals with
disabilities across the autism spectrum,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also medically frail individuals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the areas that this really
world-renowned research center works in is
[SPEAKER_07]: the effects of diet and a very holistic
approach to how we deal with folks with
[SPEAKER_07]: these kinds of disabilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they operate a pretty extensive
bio-dynamic farm on their property and in
[SPEAKER_07]: other areas around the county.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when they approached SUNY Sullivan as
a partner in an industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: experimental program, one of the things
that we were really interested in was
[SPEAKER_07]: working with them across the idea of this
bio-dynamic farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you who aren't really
familiar, bio-dynamic farming has a lot in
[SPEAKER_07]: common with organic farming, but it's
really much more of a philosophical
[SPEAKER_07]: approach to growing things in which the
entire farm is created and treated as a
[SPEAKER_07]: living organism with the livestock and the
crops and the green spaces between the
[SPEAKER_07]: crops, all treated as essentially organs
of a living, a more holistic living
[SPEAKER_07]: organism.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, one of the things that we're really
hopeful about is that this bio-dynamic
[SPEAKER_07]: farming method will have a positive impact
on CBD production in the finished product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're working in conjunction with the
Center for Discovery.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also working with CW Hemp and the
Stanley Brothers from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're working with the University of
Buffalo Pharmacy School to really provide
[SPEAKER_07]: our students with an opportunity on the
growing side and on the chemical analysis
[SPEAKER_07]: side of the finished product.
[SPEAKER_07]: It fits with our work at SUNY Sullivan in
that we have a very, one of our main
[SPEAKER_07]: focuses on sustainability and really
creating a sustainable environment within
[SPEAKER_07]: the county and for our students.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, modeling this idea of a holistic
approach to both feeding ourselves and
[SPEAKER_07]: treating ourselves as living individuals
within a larger ecosystem is really
[SPEAKER_07]: appealing to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a green building technologies
program.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a culinary arts program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as was mentioned, you know,
we were just granted the permit so we're
[SPEAKER_07]: really in the process of scoping out what
the MOU is going to look like between the
[SPEAKER_07]: four partnership entities and how each of
the entities is going to be able to bring
[SPEAKER_07]: to bear what their resources are as well
as provide opportunities to benefit them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our students are very excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our faculty are absolutely thrilled to be
working with the Center for Discovery and
[SPEAKER_07]: the folks at UB.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're really looking forward to moving
this project and really creating a proof
[SPEAKER_07]: point that these very innovative and
non-traditional farming methods can have a
[SPEAKER_07]: positive outcome and a positive impact on
this exciting new field moving forward in
[SPEAKER_07]: New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but far from least, we will hear
from Dr. Eric Hoffman from the School of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Emerging School of Pharmacy from
Binghamton University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Dr. Hoffman is an authority on drug
development and Binghamton University is a
[SPEAKER_04]: new recipient of a research permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Hoffman will discuss for us the
potential of, and I may not say this
[SPEAKER_04]: correctly, so correct me please,
but Canva Doyle, am I close?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I putting the accent in the right place
close enough?
[SPEAKER_04]: Canva Doyle, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isolated from industrial hemp as an
emerging treatment for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking forward to hearing from
you, Dr. Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as with the last speaker, this is a
collaboration between two other groups,
[SPEAKER_02]: a group that's currently growing hemp in
Kentucky called Gencana, who's here,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as a local nursery grower,
Nanticoke Gardens, which does both plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and also microgreens that serves local
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the, Binghamton University
owns the license, which was also just
[SPEAKER_02]: recently granted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is connected with the new School
of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new four story building that's
going up in downtown Johnson City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right near the medical center there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we enter our first class of PharmD
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are getting the doctor at a
pharmacy that then go on to staff the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacies in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we work with the local pharmacies
through internship programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we enter our first class this fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the research focused pharmacy
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two of the four floors of the new
building will be focused on research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I am the dean for the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was brought in from Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of drug development,
gene discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spun off three companies in different
aspects of drug development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the drugs we developed,
and I've moved two additional people with
[SPEAKER_02]: me from Children's National Medical Center
in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: on different aspects of drug development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this collaboration then is to look at
the uses of really to develop food grade
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabidiol, or CBD it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a key issue that was talked a lot
about in the morning but not so much in
[SPEAKER_02]: the afternoon is the distinction between
marijuana and the THC, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive component, and hemp,
which is really a very similar plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but which has been bred to reduce the THC
content to enrich for CBD, which is kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a diol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really it's really important to monitor
the ratios of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to keep the THC below .3 percent,
or you could end up in situations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there has been, where farmers may need
to burn the fields because of some growing
[SPEAKER_02]: condition that just raised the THC too
high above that .3 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we'll do is we have purchased a
million dollars of equipment to mass specs
[SPEAKER_02]: to monitor them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll set up assays that are local so we
can monitor those different ratios of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So working with Neanderthal and with
Gencona, look at the different varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: under different growing conditions,
see what those ratios are, and then decide
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're going to take forward in drug
development or through foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gencona is releasing a beverage within
the next month or two, which includes CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: oil as part of that down in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to develop that, both even through
the restaurants, like microgrids,
[SPEAKER_02]: microgreens you've heard about from
others, but then through the drinks and
[SPEAKER_02]: the health food, but then through actual
drug development for specific what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called indications or diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: As was just mentioned, it is in many
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is in many clinical trials for
intractable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So children with epilepsy that standard
treatments are not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epilepsy, as you know, if you have too
many attacks, it actually destroys your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: High frequency disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so CBD has shown a lot of promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that, and there's both 100% CBD and
also a mixture of THC and CBD currently in
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials that looks quite
promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already five companies that are
publicly traded in this space as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: developing hemp medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're, I think, going to focus on
is looking at these ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most drugs, to develop them as we
have, you need a very purified single
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule that you're taking forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look at the toxicity,
you can look at efficacy, all these dot
[SPEAKER_02]: all your I's and cross your T's with the
regulatory, both FDA and EMA in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've done that, we know how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that for three drugs and
brought them now through clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: this group that's now at SUNY Binghamton.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is, people realize that a
lot of these mixtures actually work
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a tiny bit of THC below that .3
might actually help efficacy or make the
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's regulatory is more challenging,
but their 21st century cures was just
[SPEAKER_02]: passed by the government in December,
I think you've read about that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to really expedite and drug development
and they're loosening some of these rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a good time to look at
both single components of hemp as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: mixtures of the oil of hemp in efficacy
and in epilepsy and other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders as was also heard about in terms
of autism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what our focus is,
is to leverage our drug development
[SPEAKER_02]: expertise, which is newly emerging at
Binghamton in the new School of Pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_02]: with this growing hemp industry and
whether we're using isolated compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: under certain growing conditions and how
those change and help out the industry as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as monitoring these through testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much and no surprise,
yes please, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: No surprise, the group has come up with
some outstanding questions and in fact the
[SPEAKER_04]: first one is for you Dr. Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question is, CBD oil is currently
being produced from industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_04]: sold in all 50 states as a healthcare
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is controversy about both the
legality and also the quality of the
[SPEAKER_04]: product and some product has been
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the state view the overlap
between industrial hemp and healthcare
[SPEAKER_04]: products made from hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a legal gray area?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's really, I started touching on
that and that's a very important point and
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA itself struggles with that issue,
the nutraceuticals versus the medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought up one key point previously
was are you dealing with a single purified
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule?
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD is just like THC, is a single
entity, so is CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But an oil from a plant is a mixture of
all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see that's the question, are you
really taking the oil as a starting
[SPEAKER_02]: material to isolate just one compound
that's ultra pure?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's definitions by the FDA and EMA
what that purity has to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you able to take the mixture and
then move that through the drug
[SPEAKER_02]: development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the problem with that is that mixture
has to be reproducible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have a mixture today from one
plant or one farm that becomes a different
[SPEAKER_02]: mixture the next day and you're calling it
the same drug because you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the key issue of reliability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact what Nantico plans to do is
instead of going to seeds, where seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: because of genetics as you know can create
some variability and open pollination,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, which, well I'll come back to
that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: A key point that was brought up this
morning, which I'll reiterate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Nantico is looking at vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically taking a single clonal plant
then separating that into whole clonal
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and that way could that make it
much more reliable and reproducible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now obviously you're not going to do that
at hundreds of acres scale for making
[SPEAKER_02]: clothes or sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for medicines that's probably
feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one thing that was mentioned this
morning just as a sidebar is that growing
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp on a large scale in New York could be
a great antidote to marijuana farms
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because basically if you cross pollinate
you're going to kill your THC content in
[SPEAKER_02]: your neighboring marijuana farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sort of a cute anecdote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting response there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next two questions are agronomic in
nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll give some folks some
opportunities to address these.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is must you direct seed hemp or can
you start it indoors and transplant it
[SPEAKER_04]: out?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a stab at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you can start it indoors and
transplant it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're talking about fairly large
acreage that could be a lot of work to try
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly if you started something
indoors you could get a jump on the
[SPEAKER_05]: growing season to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think economically that would add to the
inputs into production but certainly it
[SPEAKER_05]: would be feasible as far as I am aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second agronomic question here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would there less likely be weed pressure
on a hemp crop if the crop followed a corn
[SPEAKER_04]: crop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll answer that one too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure quite how to answer that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would, I mean certainly with a crop
rotation like that, that would help with
[SPEAKER_05]: the weed problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that I would be concerned about
is that with corn production a lot of time
[SPEAKER_05]: there are herbicides that are like
atrazine types of herbicides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my understanding is that could be
really detrimental to trying to establish
[SPEAKER_05]: a hemp crop the following season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those type of herbicides tend to
remain in the soil for at least another
[SPEAKER_05]: growing season if not two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think in most cases unless it were
organic production for corn I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not advisable to try to produce hemp
right after a corn crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next couple of questions focus really
on the business aspects of growing hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one is I think a really,
really important one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is growing hemp seen possibly as an
acreage shift opportunity or an acreage
[SPEAKER_04]: expansion opportunity?
[SPEAKER_04]: In New York State.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thoughts from anyone on the panel?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say both.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would allow any farm to diversify their
crops given changes in growing season,
[SPEAKER_06]: changes in opportunities, changes in
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might see interest bringing underused
ag land back but also putting it into
[SPEAKER_06]: rotation in existing crop land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoughts from anyone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add I think the economics
have to be hammered out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will compete or not compete
with the other crops that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it looks promising.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might add a quick comment too that I
think this is an opportunity for growers
[SPEAKER_05]: across the state who want to diversify.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one more crop that would allow
them to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This next question is where or how does
the state of New York have competitive
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage compared to other states in
terms of farm production and various
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing or product development
opportunities?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the big obvious piece is what
we've talked about in specialty crops for
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as I've been around New York State
is the huge population that we have within
[SPEAKER_00]: a few hours of our upstate growing
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where the opportunity lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in a sense the federal
regulatory environment may not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: be helpful to us in this but other states
are going to have a hard time accessing
[SPEAKER_00]: that New York City market the way the
federal regulatory environment is right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a competitive advantage right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make a comment about production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in the northeast we have water most
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most years we have water in contrast
to many other states that like in Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to have to irrigate in most
cases there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to help in the economics
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just add that in addition to the
proximity to market none of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: states around us have come even close to
this level of organized support especially
[SPEAKER_03]: at the state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Announcements that were made earlier today
are phenomenal to see this kind of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: happening with the governor's name on this
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, New York is not only well
positioned but we've got all of the gears
[SPEAKER_03]: in motion which makes us very competitive
indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to jump in just because I have
to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know when it comes to production
races in a crop we'll always have
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll always be another part of the
country or the world that will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again to echo what our panelists have
said is that we live in the best kept
[SPEAKER_01]: secret in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have generally water, access to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some of the best growers in the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the best land grant system of
education for agriculture in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we live next door to the biggest,
most amazing marketplace in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that puts us at a distinct advantage
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have time for one last question
before we will take a brief break before
[SPEAKER_04]: the next panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are several questions that won't
be addressed right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again thank you for writing your names
and email addresses on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This next question is also an agronomic
question and it is with regard to trials
[SPEAKER_04]: that are planned for research purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question is will you be testing on
mildly sloping sites and if so will you be
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering data about how effective hemp
stands are at combating soil erosion on
[SPEAKER_04]: sloping grounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: A really good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know for our trials here at Cornell
for the next season they are not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be on sloping land.
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly as we expand across the
state there will be some sites I'm sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that are variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know some on flat land, some on
slopes, various soil types and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again with the variability that we have
across New York State it really would be
[SPEAKER_05]: who wants to expand out and evaluate these
varieties across various conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can add to that one of the sites that
we're actually looking at at the SUNY
[SPEAKER_07]: Sullivan campus is a pretty significantly
sloped site.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd be very interested in working with
your team to try to evaluate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our site last year was mildly sloped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine in the 100 acre trial this year
there will be some more steeply sloping
[SPEAKER_06]: sites given where JD Farms is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's a flat spot on the
whole farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: But given how dry last year was we didn't
see any.
[SPEAKER_06]: But earlier this morning someone mentioned
reseeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just through harvest there's quite a lot
of seed production.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was already regrowth in the field
quickly afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not that you really want to lose seed
but in terms of erosion it's reseeding
[SPEAKER_06]: itself which would help maintain the soil
where it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay please join me in giving this
wonderful group a hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
you
