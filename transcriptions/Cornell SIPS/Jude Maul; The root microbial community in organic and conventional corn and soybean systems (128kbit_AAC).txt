[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really nice to be back here and
see so many familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you today about a
research project that I have been working
[SPEAKER_02]: on in Beltsville for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the titles here, basically,
we wanted to look at how microbial systems
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to the application of glyphosate
in a variety of farming systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our objectives are to compare factors
in modern farming systems or cropping
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that impact soil microbial
communities, plant-microbe interactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: and plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this modern soil cropping systems,
that's like political code word for
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that use a whole range of
technologies, including glyphosate and
[SPEAKER_02]: Roundup Ready gene technology,
GMO technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the USDA monitors herbicides that are
registered by the EPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We monitor them regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, we'll initiate
experiments based on comments that are
[SPEAKER_02]: sent in to the Secretary from
constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the last, well, 15 years or so,
the Secretary has been getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: mail about glyphosate and some concerns
about glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a really quick review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate is a compound that blocks the
shikimic acid pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this pathway is critically important
for amino acid production as well as a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of secondary compound production.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Roundup Ready gene is a bypass for
that blockage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you apply glyphosate and you have
the Roundup Ready gene, you can continue
[SPEAKER_01]: down that pathway and get resistance to
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how the system basically works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first herbicide GMO system
that was packaged in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very popular compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was applied to about 98% of the corn
and soybean in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in the 90 or so, 95 million
acres of each of those, depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that there's a fair amount
of it applied to the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're very interested in what the
impact of this may be in the large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see over time, the popularity
and the use of it has increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the proportional use of glyphosate
among many different types of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been some issues about the
impact of glyphosate for a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've probably heard about some of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbicide resistance in weeds is very big,
is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this map here below has six panels
starting in 2002, going to 2012,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which it shows the states that have the
number of glyphosate resistant plant
[SPEAKER_02]: species in the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that it's increasing year
by year or two year by year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some concern that there's a yield
hit when glyphosate is applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may be a function of more
multiple mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an area of research that's
being conducted right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main thing that we're going to
focus on here is the effects on plant
[SPEAKER_02]: disease ecology, and really just looking
at some of the organisms that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for diseases, and not
necessarily doing a pathological screening
[SPEAKER_02]: of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of debate about this
impact of glyphosate on plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are just a few titles from
papers that talk about the effects in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere, mostly interaction with
rhizosphere compounds, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with metals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manganese was an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's been some sort of
rebuttals to that, talking about this
[SPEAKER_02]: paper is mostly based on the stoichiometry
of glyphosate application and how much
[SPEAKER_02]: actual compound you add to the soil
relative to the amount of other things in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a pretty well-done study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of debate out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were partially because of,
well, and one of the main figures that was
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly referred to was this figure
from Kramer and Means out in Purdue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this study, they have produced many
figures that look like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You apply glyphosate at time zero,
and within, say, 40 days, 50 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have significantly more fusarium
colonies growing on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium is a wilt disease that's fairly
ubiquitous in cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case, the claim was that this
type of fusarium was pathogenic and was
[SPEAKER_02]: building up in the soil in all of these
millions and millions of acres of corn and
[SPEAKER_02]: soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were asked to sort of review some of
this literature and look back at what was
[SPEAKER_02]: done that came to these conclusions and
see if we could revisit this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the application of glyphosate
indirectly shift the composition and
[SPEAKER_02]: function of the root and the soil
microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the presence of the Roundup Ready
gene in a crop cause a shift in the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial community associated with crop
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does the legacy of glyphosate
application, and we decide on plus 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, greater than 10 years, does that
contribute to the differences in
[SPEAKER_02]: root-associated microorganisms?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this study at multiple locations
and looking at both bacteria, fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in a sub-experiment, nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just going to focus on the fungi
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of fusarium-forming
knidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so where we did this experiment,
or the site I'm going to talk about today,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the USDA Beltsville Farming Systems
Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of just a few long,
long-term farming systems projects in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country that compare some sort of
conventional tillage, a no-tillage,
[SPEAKER_02]: and organic systems all at the same site
and all that were sort of experimentally
[SPEAKER_02]: designed to be compared.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of the issues related to
Chesapeake Bay eutrophication are
[SPEAKER_02]: applicable to the practices that we carry
out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we abide by the phosphorus
standards that have been implemented by
[SPEAKER_02]: Maryland State, as well as any EPA or
national standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plots were established in 1996,
and the field was no-till for 11 years
[SPEAKER_02]: before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did no-till to try to sort of
normalize things and then impose these
[SPEAKER_02]: plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it's laid out, we did a,
I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was here at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did an extensive spatial survey
of this whole entire field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on physical biochemical
attributes, blocked this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laurie, did you help in doing this
initially with Dr. Ravenhorst?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was free from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Laurie has helped with the project
over time, so I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is done by Dr. Ravenhorst at
University of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how they decided to block it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what the farm looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's slight rolling hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a wheat crop here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a major highway right back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plots are 30 feet wide and 390 feet
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use full-size tractors and 10-foot wide
implements to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got a 30-foot planter now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to plant in one run now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just a kind of a view of
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to sort of zoom into this
area to show you the plot layout so you
[SPEAKER_02]: get an idea of how the experiment was
designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm talking about today,
I'm going to be comparing four different
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: No-till system and a chisel-till system.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both are three-year rotations,
corn, soybean, wheat, mineral fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two organic systems,
either a three-year or a six-year
[SPEAKER_02]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three-year is corn, soybean,
wheat, and then a hairy veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the six-year is corn, soybean,
wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes into three years of
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both have legume and animal
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use cultural practices to suppress
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we zoom in on this is just rep
three, what you'll see is the different
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that we have compared here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every system is composed of subplots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we have subplots there is
because we have every phase of the
[SPEAKER_02]: rotation present every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So corn, soybean, wheat for a three-year
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a six-year rotation, we'd have
corn, soybean, wheat, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can compare any phase of the
rotation and control for all the weather
[SPEAKER_02]: for that particular year, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll come into play a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be talking about the
Organic II system today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of like a foil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a bad system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes corn, soybean, corn, soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good at producing weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within these plots, I set up
microplots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we have to pay attention to here,
and I failed to label them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these three microplots right here is
what we're looking at today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a roundup-ready corn genotype
that's sprayed, a roundup-ready corn
[SPEAKER_02]: genotype that's not sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an isoline of the roundup-ready corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same exact genotype,
but just without the RR gene in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the same thing for
soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the roundup-ready soybean sprayed,
not sprayed, and then the isoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we're comparing sprayed and
not sprayed, we can control for time in
[SPEAKER_02]: the season by comparing the sprayed and
the not sprayed of the same genotype that
[SPEAKER_02]: have sort of moved through time together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a secondary comparison,
we can compare the roundup-ready genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: to the isoline to get at whether or not
the single gene in there is making any
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a close-up to show you
those plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main plots are 30 feet wide,
390 feet long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microplots are 10 feet wide by 20 feet
long, and we harvested the middle two
[SPEAKER_02]: rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at corn and soybean here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We harvested 15-centimeter monoliths at
two dates, a vegetative 5 and reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, a vegetative 5, we sampled
and then sprayed glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about 25 days later, at R2,
we came in and did this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have right before glyphosate is
applied, and then 25 days after glyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: is applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was done for each crop,
each genotype, and four monoliths per
[SPEAKER_02]: plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that was replicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we isolated bulk and rhizosphere soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We broke the bulk soil away and then
brushed the rhizosphere soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We snipped the roots, washed them,
or washed them, snipped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually surface sterilized
them and then plated them out on comatose
[SPEAKER_02]: selective media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a selective media for
fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this part here is really replicating
what was done in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did a lot of soil
biochemistry, fossil lipid fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we did sequencing on 16 as an ITS
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some additional analysis,
which I'll talk about a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of this is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the plants, we also did some
plant biochemistry yield and did some more
[SPEAKER_02]: specific sort of analysis of symbiotic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the root plating score.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we scored over 6,100 root segments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ID'd over 2,400 colonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lab was just like, it just was full of
plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of fun to go back and do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we kept coming up with usual
suspects based on morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would streak them out onto minimal
media to try to make them sporulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we were doing that, we would
sequence the ITS region of different
[SPEAKER_02]: morphotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did about 384 individual ITS sequencing
to come up with these 11 taxa,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were sort of the usual suspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this non-sporulating one was some
fungi we couldn't get to sporulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just grow on this minimal media,
and we're trying to figure out what it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have here is corn on the top row
here, 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soy on the bottom row, 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you see an S, that means that the,
sorry, let me step back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is comparing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue is the isoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue is the isoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray is the roundup-ready genotype
without spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green is the roundup-ready
genotype with spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you see an S, that means the spray
was significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a significant increase here when we
sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see a RR, that means that the gene
had an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is barely significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you see a C, that means it's a
comparison between the blue bar and the
[SPEAKER_02]: green bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means the combination of the spray
and the genotype is significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, what I see here is just messiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we were doing this, my whole
crew is saying to me, why are we doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to ID a usarium or a
macrofamina just from morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going through and doing hundreds
and hundreds of samples like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably some of the mess in here is
mis-IDing these very similar-looking
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, what we're doing is
we're looking for this response.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to see, when we repeated
their experiments, if we see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our data doesn't support this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we see,
[SPEAKER_02]: not random, but inconsistent times when we
saw significant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we described this as pretty stochastic
growth in the sense that we would see
[SPEAKER_02]: colonies here and not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had lots of replicates to try to
flesh this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our data doesn't support this exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to look at things in
addition to just a usarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we IDed all these other taxa and
started looking at them from the
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint of, OK, well, we have these
consortia of organisms here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we see any relationship among the
organisms, even if it's not in response to
[SPEAKER_02]: the treatments?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing that popped out,
and this was very clear looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: plates, is that usarium and macrofamina
seem to co-occur together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is that trichoderma
seemed antagonistic to usarium and a few
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in some cases, it had a positive
correlation as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the organic and no-till trichoderma
seemed fairly antagonistic to a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a picture of usarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tended to be positively correlated with
macrofamina, trichoderma, typical green
[SPEAKER_02]: spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked like it was antagonistic to a
number of different taxa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on to the sequencing part of
this project, we wanted to use the same
[SPEAKER_02]: exact samples that we used for the root
culturing work to then extract DNA from
[SPEAKER_02]: the samples and attempt to assemble a
reflection of the composition of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of words, but it might be
very important to some people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just go through this real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used MySeq platform, and we looked
at 1,152 separate samples over 28 plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used full plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gives you an idea of how deep we
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: We trimmed the ends using CutAdapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these are fairly new programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dada2 was used to filter the ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And infer sequence variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason I'm pointing this out is
that we're not taking the sequences and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to align them to a big database and
say, what species are these?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using probability to say,
this sequence occurred so many times in my
[SPEAKER_02]: data that it's probably real, even if NCBI
or some database doesn't have a copy of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're determining sequence variance
by probability and not whether it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: ID'd before or its similarity to something
that's been ID'd before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of where this
field is going, because we realize we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't surveyed everything yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't make sense to throw out
all that variation and just keep binning
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves into clusters or groups that
have been commonly identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought this data into Filoseq.
[SPEAKER_02]: And created some phylogenetic trees and
then used that information to create
[SPEAKER_02]: ordinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within this DC2 program, you can run
permanovas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought that was a very important
thing, especially in a study like this
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have multiple environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to try to tease out which ones
are playing the most important role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we plotted this out in gdplot and
R.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of this work here, we post on a
GitHub site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a public repository for data
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we basically put all our scripts up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we publish this, you'll be able to
go get our data and our program and rerun
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you want to or tweak it the way
you think you might.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very much publicly available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the sequence data,
here is a rarefaction curve of all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just to give you idea of the
variance among the whole experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sequenced 300 base pair paradigm
fragments and generated about 129 million
[SPEAKER_02]: reads with a mean
[SPEAKER_02]: read count of 112 per sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: We identified between, now this is
actually calling OTUs, but we identified
[SPEAKER_02]: between 800 and 600 OTUs in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the rarefaction measure
based on the systems, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: significant difference among the systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is everyone, or not everyone,
but a lot of people have seen these
[SPEAKER_02]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a distribution of the dominant
fungal tax in the farming systems project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see conventional till, no till,
organic three, and organic six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at it right off the bat,
you see, well, I actually, I won't tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you what I think of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here between in the organic systems,
there's some differences here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some things that stand out really
clearly, like this is present in the no
[SPEAKER_02]: till and not as much in the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this one in particular is present
in organic three and is just in organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are these?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Basidium icetes, a little
puffball.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all saprophytic organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular organism produces a lot of
phenol oxidases and actually produces
[SPEAKER_02]: lipases.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are Pesiazales.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've probably seen these out in the
field, if you ever work out in the field
[SPEAKER_02]: in corn or soybean fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, we really only saw, or mainly in the
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is interesting that there are
organisms that seem sort of dominant in
[SPEAKER_02]: organic systems as opposed to conventional
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: These systems receive poultry litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very hard to sort of dissect out
exactly what could be influencing these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to follow up on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here, this Ascotia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a leaf lesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting about this is that
it seems to come on late in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one really focuses on it as a
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see it all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bean plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it infects wheat as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have thought that it really
doesn't do much because it comes on right
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the end of seed fill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder, though, if some organisms
that we see appear late in the season like
[SPEAKER_02]: that are not actually latent organisms
that are impacting the growth of these
[SPEAKER_02]: crops and maybe more highly abundant in
some systems rather than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we want to look at the structure of
the fungal community, generally what we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: do is develop distance matrices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we've done that and
plotted them using NDMS with a transformed
[SPEAKER_02]: time step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this looks pretty confusing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look here, you have date 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: This triangle 2013 is a circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the different systems are the
different colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can see that the no-till is
here, CT.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got org 6 here and the org 3 over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, the circles, and it's a little
clearer in corn than in soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the circles are on the lower part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the triangles are up further in the
graph above the axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what we tried to do here was because
we observed just looking at shear fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: counts on plates, we knew that there were
major differences between years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there were differences in
temperature, not only the mean temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: but the timing or the periodicity of the
temperature, but also water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we tried to do here was create a
covariance matrix that we could transform
[SPEAKER_02]: the data with to account for the time
factor, since we knew it was a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it worked, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it worked, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's better ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a new implementation of time,
too, which explicitly addresses this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So time series and repeated measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Greg Caparazzo, who wrote this
program, is going to come to my lab next
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to work on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's doing this right now in human
microbiome systems, where you have many
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals who all start off with a
different microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you give them a treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all move, like the microbiomes
move.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not all coalescing as a single
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where the need for doing
this came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in ag science, we have a real
need for this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, in the next few weeks,
we'll be able to create a covariance
[SPEAKER_02]: structure that we can use to control for
the things that we know have changed,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially over time, so time and weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just look straight at abundances
and code this data differently,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're actually doing it differently with a
PCA analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to use NMDS because of the way
we did the transformation of the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just a Bray Curtis distance
matrix represented in PCS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the differences here, we have spray
and no spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CT spray and no spray is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: NT spray and no spray is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the spray and no spray are kind of all
jumbled on top of each other here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Organic 6 here, again, spray and no
spray jumbled on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the Organic 3 over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw this, I was very excited
because I thought, wow, that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: After 26 years of management of these
systems, we could see really distinct
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial communities that have developed
over our consistent differential
[SPEAKER_02]: management of these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally don't like drawing circles
around things because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have statistics to back that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty clear that we have distinction
among the systems, but no clear
[SPEAKER_02]: distinction among whether spray has an
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at these a lot, but I don't
know if you see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But time, if we coded this by time,
you'd see 2013 and 2014, 2013,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of see that differential
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully, when we apply better
statistics to this, we'll maybe be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: consolidate those data clouds a little bit
better and have a better understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: how each individual plot or each
individual plot changes when we apply
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like we're not drilling in well
enough here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did permit and permanova.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like using permanova for the sort of
complex models like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soy is on top and the corn is on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, the take-home message is that
the system is significant and the year is
[SPEAKER_02]: significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sampling date, meaning before spray or
after spray, is significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure how much faith I put in
this interaction term here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty consistent among crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these same exact factors are what we
see when we look at our other locations,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were in Mississippi and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: My graduate student sent me the permanova
for the bacterial stuff this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's showing some of the same results,
but some things are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be that the bacteria are
actually responding more to both system
[SPEAKER_02]: and glyphosate application.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that will be another talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what can we do with this data?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the change in abundance of the
major tax of the change in abundance in
[SPEAKER_02]: response to glyphosate application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you see here are a wide variety of
organisms that both increase or decrease
[SPEAKER_02]: in relation to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can place organisms on this plot
that are unidentified down to the genus
[SPEAKER_02]: level because we use that variant calling
approach where we're not relegated to
[SPEAKER_02]: picking a particular OTU name from a
database.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the case of here, we have
fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a species of fusarium that
increased, and we also see some fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: that decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really what we're seeing is no
general response to glyphosate
[SPEAKER_02]: application, but most likely, if these are
actually responding to the glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's differential response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some other evidence in the
literature that that may actually be the
[SPEAKER_02]: case, that you might have bacteria and
fungi that are resistant or not resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the sensitivity of that gene in
the shikimic acid pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no clear positive or negative
impacts of glyphosate application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the presence of the Roundup Ready gene
on the likelihood of fusarium being
[SPEAKER_02]: present in the corn was not clear either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really looks like there's not a strong
impact of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The culturing data suggests that some
organisms may co-occur, such as fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: macrophimina, and some may be
antagonistic, like fusarium versus
[SPEAKER_02]: trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sequencing data suggests that the
overall fungal diversity among the systems
[SPEAKER_02]: is not significantly different,
but the structure of the community is
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overall diversity is not different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the tools that we're using right
now, we can't discern whether there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect of glyphosate, but these results
suggest to the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there is no effect of glyphosate on
the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna be working on the repeated
measures to refine this analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dietrich is working on network
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example from this paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dietrich actually has a paper out in which
he did this type of network analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a different study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's gonna apply these two different
types of network analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a global analysis, which would take
into consideration all of the interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: between the organisms that are identified
in any particular sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could imagine this as we may see
networks that break out into nodes that
[SPEAKER_02]: are representative of either crops or
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sure how that's gonna look right
now, but we would imagine it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: something sort of disjointed like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other type of network analysis which
we wanna look into is this pairwise
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis where you create minimal networks
that then have very specific rules for how
[SPEAKER_02]: OTUs or organisms fit into the network.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case here, and this gets at
this co-occurrence question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of where there's a
rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a bacteria and a pseudomonas,
then this flavobacterium will be present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's saying out of all the
data, if there's these two organisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: this other organism is always going to be
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to look specifically at some
of those questions to get at potential
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four crop diseases, and we think we may be
able to pick them out of data sets like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that we have a culturing
project that goes right along with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have all the isolates in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we get the genotypes, we could go
back and screen the actual organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done a little bit of this
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my postdoc, Ryan Kepler.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually started this project after we
started doing the sampling on the main
[SPEAKER_02]: project, but we finished this beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where we said, okay,
now if we have organisms that are varying
[SPEAKER_02]: their response to our management,
some are going up, some are going down,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe we can get a handle on how these
cropping systems are affecting these
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms by sort of drilling into one
organism where we know a lot more about
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, we're interested in this
organism metarysium, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: entomopathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're particularly interested in it
because it kills bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been working with it a little
bit as a biocontrol for organic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks kind of like trichoderma in that
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what Ryan did was he targeted nine
loci that are involved in metarysium
[SPEAKER_02]: mating type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went in and out of these soils that
were collected from the field,
[SPEAKER_02]: went in and cloned, barcoded, indexed,
and sequenced these nine different loci.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we were able to do from that was
determine that there were two major clades
[SPEAKER_02]: of metarysium Roberti STI present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we identified two major clades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we have here is this is the same
data, it's just coded differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is clade one, and this is clade two.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a minimal spanning network for
unique microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this is is these OTUs are always
associated with these.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thicker the line, the stronger the
association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thinner the line, the weaker the
association.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a tiny dotted line there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're looking at in the top half
of this, what we're looking at is the size
[SPEAKER_02]: of the node is how many OTUs we collected
that fall into that node.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's the actual abundance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the pie chart in there is how
those OTUs were distributed among soybean,
[SPEAKER_02]: corn, or alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you can see is that clade one
and clade two respond very differently to
[SPEAKER_02]: these different clades.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're different crops, or somewhat
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some OTUs that are dominated by
corn, some that are dominated by soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look on the lower half, we're
looking at the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, you can see differences as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, these OTUs are,
in this case, preferentially found in the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic 6, and here they're evenly
distributed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this is telling us is that even
within, I mean, if we sequence the ITS of
[SPEAKER_02]: this metarysium, it would tell us it's the
same exact organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, at a much finer scale, we can see
that different mating types of this single
[SPEAKER_02]: organism are responding differently to
both the system and the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, I would say that our farming
systems management, it does influence
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial community structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases, our broad ways of
identifying these organisms may be
[SPEAKER_02]: clouding our ability to really look at the
fine-tuned effects of our management
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, ultimately, our goal isn't to be
able to identify an organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we want to do that is so we can
monitor these organisms so we can see how,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we make decisions in the field,
when we make a decision that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a long-term decision for how we manage
this field, we want to be able to monitor
[SPEAKER_02]: these organisms closely enough so we can
see if they are being affected,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're resilient, if they're
functioning the way we want them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, we're really trying to
design tools that allow us to assess the
[SPEAKER_02]: agro-ecosystem and make recommendations
that provide resilience and sustainability
[SPEAKER_02]: for the long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, this is a team of folks that
helped in this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephanie Orwood from University of
Maryland, graduate students and postdocs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a bunch of folks from USDA in
Belzel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you continue to do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking of long-term experiments
because people don't usually apply a
[SPEAKER_04]: roundup for one year or two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep doing it over decades,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is anyone looking into long-term
effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the things we tried to do
here was to compare fields like the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic fields had never had glyphosate
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really get into this that
much, but the organic fields had never
[SPEAKER_02]: seen glyphosate, and the conventional
fields had seen glyphosate for
[SPEAKER_02]: 20-something years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of experimental design,
we were kind of stepping back in history
[SPEAKER_02]: and saying, OK, here are these examples
that are already set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start to determine differences
between them?
[SPEAKER_02]: In our other locations, we had fields that
had been under management glyphosate for
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years or so and fields that were just
transitioned out of like, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are very, very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to set up an experiment
like that, but you might have to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that are already existing to get
those long-term effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But glyphosate has been around since the
70s, so I'm sure there's examples of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Cornell has examples of long-term
with and without glyphosate application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited to see what your soil
bacteria do because your experiment is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually a perfect design to test for size
and the idea that with continuous
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-something years of glyphosate
applications versus not having that
[SPEAKER_04]: application, is it possible that you have
an enrichment of soil bacteria with
[SPEAKER_04]: glyphosate resistance?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because initially, the whole GMO of the
plants that have that trait, it was
[SPEAKER_04]: initially isolated from soil bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can take a subset of your soil
samples from the different treatments and
[SPEAKER_04]: then submit it for metagenomics,
where you get the whole metagenomes,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you look for the resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe you'll look to see if
certain taxa do you see diversification of
[SPEAKER_04]: those genes across the taxa.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a really amazing pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking about that, and we went
into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have another presentation on the
nitrogen fixation within the soil
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a whole other complement to this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of doing the metagenome,
we're doing some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we did was we isolated the
rhizobia from the nodules of the sprayed
[SPEAKER_02]: and non-sprayed round-up ready plants and
the isoline plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're planning on doing specific PCR,
basically, to sequence those genes from
[SPEAKER_02]: the different isolates to look for the
resistant and the non-resistant one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would basically do correlation
analysis there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the metagenomic analysis,
I mean, that would be great and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be overkill to get at that one
question and very expensive for the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of samples that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were thinking of getting isolates,
like 1,000 isolates or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and just start sequencing the
pyruvate phosphosynthase gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm thinking along the same
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is maybe a knock-on question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not directly something you talk
about in your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just curious, because you'd
probably know better than anybody the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with anything, the dose makes the
poison, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we spray glyphosate on the plants,
it has surfactants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that make it stick to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spray it right on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make sure it sticks on the leaf so it
kills those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not, if it's random, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not getting taken up through the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there data on what is the actual
concentration of glyphosate in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at the time of application,
let alone like a week later, two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: later?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for what period of the year would
you have a concentration of glyphosate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a competitive inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be at a high enough
concentration to have the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what period of the year would it
exceed the concentration if the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: would even see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is data on the exudation rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we specifically did, there was,
I used to call it the indirect effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're applying it to the plant
and you're affecting the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think, a neat aspect of
this, just in general, that it's all of
[SPEAKER_02]: this, any treatment effect is transmitted
through a plant, xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is information on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants leak a lot of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The surfactants stay, or some of them
stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I forget what the exact number was,
but it was in the 10% of the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: applied concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does stay in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that paper, I can give you the
reference later, but one of the papers
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it's all recorded so you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the papers that I put up here that
talked about the stoichiometry of
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate addresses that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically how much of the product
gets transformed into breakdown products,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's another issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not only is glyphosate a poison,
but it's breakdown product that is created
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant as a way of detoxifying it is
itself a toxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But interestingly enough, more to
unicellular organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a very interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a pulse and a selection that
will then fade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the half-life of glyphosate,
the molecule itself, is under two weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, in the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's mixed with something,
then you have a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, if you look at it,
it looks like great microbial food,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it's done labeling studies,
it doesn't stick around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you do get that pulse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the susceptible bacteria are probably
succumbing to it, at least in the short
term.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a quick comment, and more
importantly, a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plant biology research on this,
there's a lot of biotropic pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application, it increases resistance
in the plant to a lot of biotropic
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some of the faculty sacrifice you
mentioned, it increases their number,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's actually more disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the lifestyle of the
fungus, as well, is what that direction is
[SPEAKER_00]: between glyphosate and the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started out your discussion about
plant health.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any intention to actually look at
symptomology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And both fusarium and macrophimina would
lend themselves very well, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: both cause very pronounced root rot in
both the soybean and the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so numbers of things are great,
but it would be interesting to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you getting more root rot correlated
with this?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you probably know, it's very
difficult to assess that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not difficult to assess it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a pathologist out in our
fields, and they were like, there's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of disease here at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we generally don't have fusarium and
macrophimina as a problem in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, I'm thinking maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are data points.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I thought it was apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other side of the farm,
it's very sandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This section here is pretty clay-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there's an old brick factory up
the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to stop there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jude is pretty busy this afternoon with
emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will join us for morning feed tomorrow
at the lounge on the seventh floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he has time after that to meet
with folks tomorrow Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you would like to have time with
Jude, please come and let us know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can get you in full schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
