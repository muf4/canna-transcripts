[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking about cutting edge
technologies in the imaging facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, all the labels that are
new are instruments that have just arrived
[SPEAKER_00]: this year or we're planning to get in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of a services overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have standard microscopes and
fluorescence tools, so fluorometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have advanced microscopes, what we call
advanced microscopes, so confocal,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expecting a super resolution system
in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a laser capture micro-dissection
system, a fax, a CT, and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies that we call intervital
imaging and then support for image
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and visualization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how we normally work, is you make
an appointment, we sit down, we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to do, and we try and put
you on the tool that will work out best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what tool you want to use,
we'll get you trained in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we generally charge by the hour,
but the fax and the CT are full service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you drop off your specimens and we
image them for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, our staff is our most
important resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Richo runs the CT, he's gonna be tag
teaming with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carol Bales right here runs microscopy and
fax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joanna Delacruz, microscopy and the
intervital imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Theresa Porre does CT, super
resolution, and some 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm tangled on the system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our confocal microscopes serve probably
the biggest number of users.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you probably know, confocal microscopy
was developed for imaging into thicker or
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I do have, no that's not a pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enables you to get a nice clear
detailed section into what would appear
[SPEAKER_00]: optically blurry on a normal microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really, it's more kind of a one
stop shop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our confocal microscopes are incredibly
well engineered and intuitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people use them for thin samples and
thick samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can choose whatever
excitation line you need, your emission
[SPEAKER_00]: color, the bandwidth of your emission
color, and depending on what system you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use, you can have up to 34 different
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have automated stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna image something with a
field of view that is larger than what
[SPEAKER_00]: your objective provides, it will
automatically tile for you, or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at different positions and follow
them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have automated focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they have everything to
keep yourselves happy on the stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature modulation or gas modulation
if you need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our spinning disc system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for if you need speed on the order
of 100 images per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a fast focus motor if you need
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this system is also good if you're
having photo toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this system is supposed to be gentler
on your specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so multi-photon microscopy was
developed here a couple of decades ago in
[SPEAKER_00]: the web lab here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been lots of user built
multi-photon systems around, not entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we actually, as of last month,
we have a lovely, nicely engineered
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-photon system that's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you have to do is type in the
wavelength and press go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually easier to use than some
of the standard linear lasers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what multi-photon gives you is deeper
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for thicker pieces of tissue or
live plants, live mice, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you access to second harmonic
generation and other nonlinear signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, probably most importantly,
it gives you access to axially restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: photo damage and photo activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multi-photon microscopy was really
heavily adopted into the neuroscience
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example, imaging probably the
world record, imaging a millimeter down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the vasculature of mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, especially young brain is pretty
transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably this is kind of a special thing
most people get around 500 or 600 microns
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an example of some images that
have just been taken recently on our new
[SPEAKER_00]: LSM 780 multi-photon system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a cleared poplar leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't see it very well from over
here, but you can essentially image all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through the leaf into the,
you know, from, I'm gonna get,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, leaf terminology,
the palisades into the mesophyll here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you essentially get all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was taken by Monica Carvalho from
Carl Nicklaus's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're interested in the veinlets
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a single image, you know,
taken out of this stack right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that you can image pretty
well all the way through the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clear leaf, if you need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multi-photon, also gives you 3D
resolved photo bleaching, photo
[SPEAKER_00]: destruction and photo activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk a little bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, if I focus a standard laser beam
through a fluorescent sample right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that you get pretty much just as
much photo activation all along the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confocal, what it does is basically just
image this part, it throws out this part
[SPEAKER_00]: and this part by using a detector aperture
that is optically conjugate or confocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How multi-photon works is it actually just
activates at the focal volume right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a zoom up of this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this enables you to do things that are
a little more quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you want to know about the
mobility in your sample, you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some, a standard photo bleaching
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in three dimensions, it turns out that
that's very difficult with normal linear
[SPEAKER_00]: excitation because, so you would go along
right here, you would park your laser beam
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a bleaching pulse right here,
which bleaches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this recovery is due to unbleached
molecules that diffuse back into your
[SPEAKER_00]: focal volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is dependent both on your
diffusion coefficient and your focal
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single photon, it's a very not very well
defined focal volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two photon, it's very well defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get good numbers out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single photon, you can't get good numbers
in three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also applicable to photo
activated GFP molecules such as MEOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you excite with purple
light and you turn the green molecule to
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can watch this diffuse away and
you can quantitatively determine what the
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion coefficient is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also, for instance, targeted ablation
if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example from the Lammerding lab
from Philip Iserman.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they would like to do is sever the
actin filaments within a cell without
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, they're gonna, this is
using normal confocal microscopy to image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna use multi photon to
sever the actin filaments which are above
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they do that without
damaging the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the second place winner in our
image contest this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your images ready for spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to harp on this for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area right now of optogenetics is
really hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to optically activate signaling
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all probably know more about these
phytochrome B as a light sensing protein
[SPEAKER_00]: because it came from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea here is that if you
activate phytochrome B at 650 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will bind this phytochrome interaction
factor or the blue triangle right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have now engineered this into
mammalian systems where if you optically
[SPEAKER_00]: activate this protein, it will bring a row
effector molecule to the membrane surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically activate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscope PowerPoint has stopped working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, doesn't like that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what you would have seen if you saw
that movie, and that movie was just taken
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Nature paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically you can see that if you
optically activate, let me go back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you optically activate this cell,
what you see is that pseudopod extension
[SPEAKER_00]: in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I just wanted to make the
point that the molecular biology is really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard, but the optical activation is super
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you know, we have a
microscope stage that will keep your cells
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do any kind of optical
activation anywhere for any amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, it's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very intuitive how to do it on
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to that, this is the laser
capture microdissection system,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about moving laser beams around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the idea here is this is
mostly made for histological type sections
[SPEAKER_00]: that you place them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, mostly you place them on these
specialized slides that have a little thin
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of plastic on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you identify regions of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, breast epithelial cells,
and you press go, and it will basically
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out the region that you're interested
in and puff it into the epindorf tube for
[SPEAKER_00]: further analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example from Joss's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: His students are interested in epithelial
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut out those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually imaging the cap right
here of the epindorf tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that they've picked out those
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You close up the cap and you send it off
to genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be done at the single cell
level and even the single nuclei level if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're patient enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, all the technologies
that I talked about so far are limited by
[SPEAKER_00]: diffraction, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is if you have an
infinitely small point and you image it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get a point spread
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to get this into a talk,
lambda over 2NA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lambda, the wavelength that you're
working with, divided by 2NA, the
[SPEAKER_00]: numerical aperture of your objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the size of your point
spread function.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a couple of spots within that,
they will not be able to be resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it's a soap box of mine,
this is actually point spread functions in
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, so lambda over 2NA,
the width of the point spread functions is
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but it's actually the length of the
point spread functions that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on NA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what changes as you go
to lower NA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super resolution microscopes are
microscopes that break the diffraction
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of, a lovely
example of chromosomes from Paula Cohen's
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see with normal microscopy,
you can't resolve the strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sort of thing, whereas with super
resolution microscopy, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sort of thing is really important
to her because she studies chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: crossover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where they crossover is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super resolution microscopy is actually
a bunch of microscopies with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: very different technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year's Nobel Prize to chemistry
went to Betzig, Hell, and Mörner for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betzig and Mörner were Cornell grads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a lot of you know them,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system that we're getting in
January can accommodate the first two,
[SPEAKER_00]: the localization-based and the super
resolution SIM, structured illumination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple objectives is another way,
trying to put as many objectives as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can close to the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I'm not going to talk about
correlative EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariscan is another technology that we're
going to be getting in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So localization-based super resolution
microscopy is actually, so this goes by
[SPEAKER_00]: Stormpalm.
[SPEAKER_00]: GSD is actually pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine that these are molecules
that you would like to be able to resolve,
[SPEAKER_00]: these little yellow things, if they're
within the point spread function,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is indicated by the red blur here,
you will not be able to resolve them
[SPEAKER_00]: normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you can get them to blink,
so this comes on and then off,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you basically look for the center of
the point spread function, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blinks on, you look for the center,
and this blinks on and off, and you look
[SPEAKER_00]: for the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have resolved your fluorophores to
greater than the diffraction limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of Alexa 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 647 labeled tubulin in a storm
buffer, and this is probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: play, but it's actually not very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just blink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A standard image of microtubules would
look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A storm image then looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've resolved the microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taken by members of the Zipfel
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example in onion bulb using
this technology, PSF, stained cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blinking super resolution
microscopies, okay, so these typically
[SPEAKER_00]: result in 20 nanometer resolution,
10 times better than the diffraction
[SPEAKER_00]: limit, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thin samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually have to use turf or evanescent
illumination, which we'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require, the tough part is really the
buffers and the fluorophore chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only use certain fluorophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally cannot be done live because
the buffers are very reducing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it requires 10,000 images for each
super resolution image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of like 10 minutes of
blinking data, which you guys all missed
[SPEAKER_00]: because I couldn't get it to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other technology that we're going
to have is super resolution structured
[SPEAKER_00]: illumination microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that this works is that instead
of illuminating uniformly, you illuminate
[SPEAKER_00]: in a diffraction pattern, and then that
pattern will beat with the spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: frequencies in your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll create a beating pattern that's
now larger so you can pick it up with your
[SPEAKER_00]: objective lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how it's implemented in the
Zysolira, the system that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a three-dimensional
diffraction pattern right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they basically mix orders
of a diffraction grating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of an image taken
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a poly-team chromosome,
and basically looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a heat shock factor, and it's in
green right here, and polymerase is in
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that you can really isolate
complexes that you can't see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard microscope image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the super resolution structured
illumination microscopy SR-SIM,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically can put your sample on
the stage, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can accommodate thicker samples,
not real thick, less than 20 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require specialized
fluorophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only requires around 15 images,
so that corresponds to five rotations of
[SPEAKER_00]: this diffraction pattern and three
translations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done live, and it results in a
resolution that's about two-fold better
[SPEAKER_00]: than diffraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no such thing as free lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ARE scan is going to be kind of
similar to the structured illumination
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this uses a detector array rather than
a comfocal pinhole and a point scanning
[SPEAKER_00]: laser comfocal setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is expected to be about the same
as the SR-SIM in terms of resolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: ease of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really new technology, so there's
not a lot of data out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of excited to be getting
this in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that we have that's new
to us is a fluorescence activated cell
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter, or FACST.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have suspension cells that you
need to separate by color or size,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you just need to analyze them,
this is an instrument that you can use for
[SPEAKER_00]: laser lines, 12 emission colors,
specimen cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sorts into two tubes or plates,
and we can take biosafety level two
[SPEAKER_00]: agents, if that is of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other technologies that we have
are sort of loosely organized into
[SPEAKER_00]: intravital imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this can accommodate sort of
bigger specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are non-invasive to minimally
invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is, you know, a lot of them
are set up for live mice, but you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: live plants as well, plants that are,
you know, still in their pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll image them, take them back,
then bring them back and image them again
[SPEAKER_00]: if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be luminescence,
ultrasound, CT, and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of our new high
resolution ultrasound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mouse heart beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good at picking up motion and
anatomical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not used a lot for plants,
but I'm not really sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image that my daughter took
over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultrasound is really fast, easy,
totally non-invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tissue can be sampled or injected via
image guided needle placement if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: need something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Doppler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it can be, depending on, you know,
how you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So visualization and analysis,
we support a bunch of different image
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some custom written algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our winter analysis,
image analysis workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in finally analyzing
all that data that you took or interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in having your students analyze all the
data that you took, so they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: this in between break in break here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
