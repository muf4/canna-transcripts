[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ronnie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my pleasure to be giving this seminar
and give this talk about cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassava is a crop I love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you get to like it by the time
we are done talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also understand that in the past few
weeks or so, you've been hearing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about cassava in the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope I will just add a little extra
to what you already heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my name on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the work I'm going to talk about is
not my work alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about the work that the group
has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the group members are here,
John Luca and his team members.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of other people, Lucas also is
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cassava is an important crop in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, in other areas like in South
America, where it originated from is also
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Asia, it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Africa, particularly because it's a
food security crop and is an important
[SPEAKER_01]: source of calories for many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 500 million people depend on it for
their daily calories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's produced by small holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those small holders are women
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop is interesting because it can
perform very well in marginal environments
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have nutrient or water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassava is a crop you can rely on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why it is so popular or famous
in Africa, because the continent has
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other crops like the grains will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask the maize breeders or the
wheat people in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cassava will always stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has some issues, some challenges
that we are trying to make the best out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out-crossing and it's clonally
propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some pros and cons with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at cassava yield, for example,
in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last decades of years, the yield
has been more or less stagnant,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can see in this chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while this is stagnant, every other
thing is rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: The area under production, the production
is increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the production is
increasing because we are also increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: the areas, opening up new land masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forests are being destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make sure we are producing
enough under the same yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of our headache as breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we stop this from happening and
make this curve go up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you come to Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have said Africa did not
participate in the last green revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can Africa do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassava is a good example to show you that
even though cassava was not part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: green revolution crop, but it's still
here, compared to other areas in South
[SPEAKER_01]: America or in Asia, particularly Thailand,
you can see the difference in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been stagnant compared to other
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why has this been happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time to breed cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you have interesting genotypes,
they are not flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flowering is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with Team SETA to fix
that as part of our project objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some progress has been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also at SEAT, Henna and Sebajo's group
has also made some progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Africa in particular, we have limited
founder lines that we introduced in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 16th and 17th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the requisite genetic
variation that is needed to make faster
[SPEAKER_01]: progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then information exchange is limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even across the world, it's limited,
but much more in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cassava breeders need better tools to
robustly address these constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: A general cassava program seeks to get
varieties that are having high and stable
[SPEAKER_01]: use with good root quality
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have as a root of cassava,
nearly 70% of that is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we waste water for that matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we deal with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we reduce that amount and produce a
higher root yield of better value within a
[SPEAKER_01]: unit space and within a unit time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that affect use are the
diseases and the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we seek to have multiple pests and
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have this first two and you miss
the third one, the farmers will say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, interesting variety, but we don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not meeting our needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have such varieties that are very
nice, but the farmers are not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them because it's not meeting their
end-use quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either it's not good for their boiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have an issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of breeders have overlooked in the
past, but we are looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nutritional traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassava is a hardy crop that can do well
in marginal environments, but yet is
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we make it more drought
tolerant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we need technologies to make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank God there are new technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are using genomics now with John Lu's
group bringing the big support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Macroassisted selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention what we've done with it in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goals group is helping us now to
develop phenotyping tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other people, like the PhD student
here, Gochukwu, and some people in SIRAD
[SPEAKER_01]: are working on high throughput
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want genplasm that responds to
end-users' needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers' expectations are that you
have stable yielding, disease resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers that are having all that
nutritional and desirable culinary traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our headaches when we
started breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been a headache that has
happened in terms of genplasm movement
[SPEAKER_01]: from South America, where the crop
originated, to Africa, where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced and has become an important
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a plot in Nigeria at the National
Rural Crop Research Institute some years
[SPEAKER_01]: back, about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these materials in this patch are
materials introduced as in vitro plant
[SPEAKER_01]: materials from SEAT, from Henan's team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not bred for virus
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Nigerian-adapted genplasm,
also called TMS 30572, growing side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were planted together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see what happened eventually to
the ones that were introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because of viruses, cassava mosaic
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the story here is that this disease
has hindered the movement of important
[SPEAKER_01]: genplasm to African cassava farmers'
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has done this successfully for 50
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we stop that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the work we did with Martin
Fregene and Henan some years ago was to
[SPEAKER_01]: get materials that are resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: To CMD, cross to Latin American genplasm,
and use them as genetic stocks to now
[SPEAKER_01]: back-cross to new materials that are
having interesting characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over that time, we were able to move
over 30,000 plantlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a visiting scientist at SEAT at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was part of what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the materials that were moved
mostly to Africa and a few to Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 700 genotypes were moved in that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to use a dominant marker,
CMD2, to tag on the plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying the resistant allele and then
ship to Africa to become a new breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was successfully done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not only carrying the resistance
to CMD, but they were also carrying to
[SPEAKER_01]: some pests like green mite and some root
quality characteristics, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: root dry matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discovered that the dry matter of
materials from Latin America were
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly higher than we would see in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are wondering, what's the reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it genes or maybe also the influence of
diseases that are in Africa but are not in
[SPEAKER_01]: Latin America?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we did was to breed for the
resistance of the virus in the absence of
[SPEAKER_01]: the disease in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the work was to identify that
major gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in next-gen, we did a GWAS study
to see if there are more sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to that virus disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, is the same CMD2 locus
that is seen to be very big here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is work done by the African breeding
programs with Manning in the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genetic basis for the resistance is
mostly this single major effect locus on
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome A.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not every material that carries
the CMD2 that resists the disease in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are very more like immune and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be other things that are
causing the differential expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we have not really have a good
handle on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are looking at people who will help
to get this thing resolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, we were able to see that
materials that were bred in Latin America
[SPEAKER_01]: were directly released in Nigeria,
Tanzania, and Ghana during this time of
[SPEAKER_01]: the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were able to see materials that
were resistant, but also meeting the other
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics that were needed by
farmers, like a high dry matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: good plant architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I'm going to talk about
is our work on cassava brown streak
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: This disease started long time ago and has
progressed over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about this is that it can
cause 100% yield loss in a farmer's plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very devastating and potentially
is not just a food security risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can also be a national security
risk if it happens in such a way in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to tell people I've discussed with
the people in the Gates Foundation before
[SPEAKER_01]: about this disease in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, why you're still having peace
in most of African countries is because
[SPEAKER_01]: this part of Africa has not been colored
in this map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is where cassava is more of a
food crop than in the East where the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if nothing is done to stop it,
then we have a catastrophe that is more
[SPEAKER_01]: than food security issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that message has been
passed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing in the next-gen
cassava is to get a handle on this menace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our partners in Uganda are helping us
do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been able to develop varieties
that are being tested in different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments now and over many years
because we need to be sure that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: good resistance sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that for now, we think we have
something in chromosome 4 and 11 to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: on with while that work is still going on
and is work done by Ismay, one of our PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: students.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the meaning of all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get it, what's the implication of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will have strategic deployment of
resistant materials in East Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly, East and Central Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these materials can be shared not only
by the Ugandan partners, but by their
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors in Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda,
where the disease is really devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for West Africa, like I said,
it is not there yet as a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not going to fold our hands and
wait till it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we do preemptive breeding for CBSZ
resistance in West Africa, just like we
[SPEAKER_01]: did for CMD in South America?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the opportunities that exist
for us to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what NextGen is exploring in
the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's technologies that will help us
incorporate those SNPs that we saw just
[SPEAKER_01]: now in the breeding programs and begin to
screen West African lines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing West Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will ship them as seeds or
seedlings to East Africa for field
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to be an easy task,
but it's something we think we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: do even with the resources we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing that we think is
important, the viruses, the CMD,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that causes cassava mosaic
disease, and the ones that cause brown
[SPEAKER_01]: streak are transmitted through a vector
called whitefly, Bermesia tabasi to be
[SPEAKER_01]: specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we breed for virus resistance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are partnering with a project
coordinated by the NRI where a student is
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fix this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that we'll be able to also get
technologies or resources or products that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help us manage the vector while we're
also managing the disease at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll move on to the talk about nutritional
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm giving data on Nigeria,
but of course, there's a global
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vitamin A is critical, iron and zinc also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a data set from Nigeria where
we have 30% of children under five vitamin
[SPEAKER_01]: A deficient, 26% of them iron deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing we discovered is that the
regions of deficiency also match areas
[SPEAKER_01]: with high cassava consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that children under five who
consume cassava are at risk of vitamin A
[SPEAKER_01]: or iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Biofortification can be a tool that we can
use to address that in remote places or
[SPEAKER_01]: poor areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we know is that when you eat a
meal of cassava, this is an adult meal
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, 500-gram meal of cassava,
you get almost every energy need you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the other, especially vitamin A,
this is what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe slightly better for iron and
zinc, but it is a bad case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set out to work with our partners,
IITS at NRI.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're supported by a project called
Harvest Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest Plus was the last recipient of the
World Food Prize for biofortification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it was on sweet potato,
but they've done a lot of work on cassava
[SPEAKER_01]: and iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work to enhance the concentration of
pro-vitamin A in cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six varieties that are high in pro-vitamin
A were released in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have also been disseminated to
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 500,000 farmers are growing this in
several communities in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a sizable number in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and also in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghana.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges we have with this is
they are not resistant to brown streaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've not been able to move them to
East Africa, where they are also needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are having that challenge at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a grant that is trying to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bridge for resistance into high vitamin A
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you give the farmers high
vitamin A cassava that are not nearly as
[SPEAKER_01]: high yielding or nearly having the high
dry matter, which is an important driver
[SPEAKER_01]: for cassava varieties, then you are going
to have another problem at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they will like it, but they will
not grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an ongoing effort to improve
the agronomic performance and other
[SPEAKER_01]: end-use qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we started, cassava is a white
root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the products are all white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were questions about,
will farmers adopt or grow these
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a lot of farmer participatory
evaluation at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the feedback we got was that
once they know that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionally beneficial to them,
they are going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it encouraged us to embark on more
multi-locational trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variety release process in African
countries, I'm sure in every country,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have their own procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in African countries, they are mostly
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in Nigeria, where I'm using as an
example, two-year multi-site performance
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation is done, both on the yield and
other end-use qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, since it's a nutritional
product, we were also very interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: how the performances were across
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had to deal with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this particular case, we dealt with
100 farmers across Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about 13 states in Nigeria were
used out of 36 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there had to be cassava growing in
areas where we saw vitamin A deficiency to
[SPEAKER_01]: be very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some materials around this were now
chosen for more evaluations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting thing we saw, I think
Henna will be interested in this too,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that when we saw one of the promising
lines, which eventually was released,
[SPEAKER_01]: TMS 01, 1968, we self-tested NRCRI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we generated quite a sizable number of
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw that you could get
transgressive segregation that was very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very nice for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we cut off this tail,
it was very important for us to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: we could double the carotenoid contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, with that tail, we saw issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw issues that when we have high
carotenoids, cassava, we are having low
[SPEAKER_01]: dry matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a negative association.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appeared there was a negative
association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been thinking it's linkage drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we think the answer may be
different from the first two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be that we are dealing with a
narrow range of founding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are not making progress with the
dry matter, because we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do a study on this for carotene
and dry matter, a scan.
[SPEAKER_01]: and the genomic scan on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still saw that for carotene,
something was happening around chromosome
[SPEAKER_01]: 1, likewise for dry matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So among our jam plasm, we are seeing
something that is explaining our negative
[SPEAKER_01]: association between dry matter and
carotene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, we know that our partner,
Henan, has different set of materials that
[SPEAKER_01]: are breaking this rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is still going on in harvest plus,
how to introduce the materials that Henan
[SPEAKER_01]: has developed to Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the challenge is breed virus
resistance into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, the virus resistant ones are
white clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think with a better understanding of
the genetics and genomics, we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: that process shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is by way of introducing next gen
cassava breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe very few people need that
introduction here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to say that in more recent times,
my time has spent on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involves many partners, but now four
breeding programs in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cornell and other partners,
BTI, JGI, Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, this partnership needed a
lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we made sure we were able to
achieve was that we moved away from this
[SPEAKER_01]: place, the project started in 2012,
and get to where we have better genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even better right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are making more progress with genetic
maps with which we can do the genomic
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding or genomic studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: A typical cassava breeding cycle would
take you so many years, 10 years or more,
[SPEAKER_01]: because each of these squares represent 12
good months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about it that you move from each
block represents a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you keep moving until you get to
variety release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you begin to disseminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like 10 years or more if you're a
very good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we shorten this and at the same
time move to our breeding target as
[SPEAKER_01]: defined by farmers, what the farmers
desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we move from our start point and
advance the population means for trace of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest until we get to where we think we
can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are making some progress in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say a few words about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the progress we think we're making
is especially in terms of saving time
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than any other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to understand the genetics for
us to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we cut short from that long
10-year cycle to something that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: begin to select a seedling stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each seed of cassava is a potential
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are all different from their
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to use different approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we evaluated different models.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the different trace of interest
we've set aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plant vigor, CMDs, the mosaic disease,
bacterial blight, dry matter, and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth, the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to see this whole mosaic
patterns of responses, both to the linear
[SPEAKER_01]: models and to the other models.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is guiding us in how we
approach our breeding and our selection
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also learning in the process,
even though we are implementing this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding strategy, but we're also learning
and knowing what to do or how to tweak
[SPEAKER_01]: things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we've made some advancements.
[SPEAKER_01]: ITA has a yearly cycle, which is an
ambitious one, but it has so far worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've advanced to the uniform
yield stage right now, while the national
[SPEAKER_01]: programs are having a two-year cycle,
where they evaluate before they select.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so still not a bad speed where the
predisposition for the preliminary yield
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing is that from the
UITs, we are going to select materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that will go for national variety release
in Nigeria for a start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that happens, that means within a
space of four or five years, we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some varieties released, which is our
main target to make breeding more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we are making breeding more
efficient, are we making progress in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trace or in the trace that matter,
like CMD resistant, like dry matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh root yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that, yes, we are making for
each of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, not in uniform speed,
but for some of them, very good
[SPEAKER_01]: heritabilities for our prediction
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even the bad ones, like the yield,
which we didn't expect this much,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're still having some substantially nice
heritabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll move on to enabling tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with Maigo and Jesse Poland,
who is also a household name here,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a project they have to develop
phenotyping protocols for different crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: for wheat and cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Maigo is managing the cassava
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called Feno App.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be having a workshop in Nigeria in
the next three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their objectives are to advance
electronic data capture through smartphone
[SPEAKER_01]: apps and to develop algorithms that we use
to extract that information and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: more useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the breeder, why are we
interested?
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide our materials for them to use
to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to the next gen fields
to make this test for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our target is to have materials that
are more like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different shapes of cassava roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are not going to work for
what we desire in the future, mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also working on white fly,
the vector of the virus diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is even a pest in some places,
and also root quality traits, like
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest physiological deterioration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are working around all these
traits to see how we can make phenotyping
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient and more accurate,
and so help in the breeding process,
[SPEAKER_01]: or help in making, accelerating the rate
of genetic improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ogochuku is also a PhD student here with
John Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's working on another area to
determine root quality traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: working in collaboration with SEAT and
SEERAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: SEERAD is a French international agency
for agricultural development and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had to get a handheld portable
NIRS machine so that in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can measure things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can measure important root quality
traits, like dry matter, so that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to get to the lab and do wet
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it will save us a lot of time,
a lot of costs in the long run,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also increase the rate of genetic
improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stage they are in is to calibrate
the data, the figures they get from the
[SPEAKER_01]: wet lab with the scans that he makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting to see the number of
materials that they've been able to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with and the ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kind of correlations that we are
having near perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asking him, are you sure about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we see this kind of materials,
even when he has made correlations or
[SPEAKER_01]: associations between data generated from
Colombia and that generated in Nigeria,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were still giving him this kind of
near perfect correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with one scan, you can get your
data for dry matter, for cyanide,
[SPEAKER_01]: for carotene, for even more traits,
as many as you have calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the way forward for cassava
breeding, we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to mention an important part of
our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a project which is managing the
data that we collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these machines now, we are generating
a lot of phenotype data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, genotyping has made it very easy to
amass a lot of data over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been able to work with BTI Lucas
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cassava base is now running.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an open database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can check it or check on Lucas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me not spend our time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what varieties will be the future for
Africa, in particular, or in the very
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate future?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned it before, varieties that
are highly nutritious, virus resistant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that are meeting the end-use preferred
traits, especially for East Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where end-use is more
important than any other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can easily reject your varieties in
East Africa if the end-use is not
[SPEAKER_01]: according to expectation because they
consume it fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the West Africans who will process
it to a good level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their tolerance level for end-use fresh
root characteristics is a bit slack than
[SPEAKER_01]: East Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for West Africa, where consumption is
more in terms of quantum, so we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: combine high productivity not as if we've
done it in East Africa, high productivity
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional traits and resistance to brown
streak disease through preemptive
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other traits that I have not
mentioned that are very important and that
[SPEAKER_01]: drive us for adoption by local farmers in
different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the reasons why the breeders
like me and others have not been focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on it is that to define it, they have not
been defined and they're not easily
[SPEAKER_01]: measurable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to define those traits,
profiles, and measure them, or develop how
[SPEAKER_01]: to measure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next gen cassava is working on this
with SIRAD and SEAD partners to make this
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Gary, you ask a woman in the
village, why do you prefer variety A to B?
[SPEAKER_01]: She says the Gary from variety A swells
better than.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think that measurement of swelling
is easy, but it's not an easy thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure because the definition is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The processing method may even affect the
way it swells and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to define that and measure
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's key for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to make our varieties amenable
to automated planting and harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a big deal right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have roots that have a better
share of life than what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you detach a cassava root from a plant,
within 48 hours, it turns black.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots begin to turn black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get deep into that for
this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the opportunities for improved
breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to optimize and accelerate our
variety improvement and release process.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the breeding has to be
accelerated or made more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are trying to use all the
technologies we can afford through the
[SPEAKER_01]: next gen cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that you don't just keep
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to run and check that you're
running accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to pay more emphasis on program
quality at the field plot levels and even
[SPEAKER_01]: in the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to also consider a
gender-sensitive breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do you involve the different
gender groups as you breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we realize that many times we
leave the traits that some gender groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially women, will consider as
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run on with the ones we have in our
minds that they are the important ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, you discover that you ran
to nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to increase our understanding
and phenotyping ability for end-use
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end, our customer is the number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer is who determines what we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned that a lot of people are
involved in this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to capture a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many that didn't make this list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they made the many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank all the people who
have supported us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people in the past who have
supported us in moving jamplasm from Latin
[SPEAKER_01]: America to Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the current one is DFID and Bill
and Melinda Gates and other partners that
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ronnie would tell me that no mambolog,
we end with take it to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end, we need to make sure that
our varieties get to the farmer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: right varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our driving force.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a review, as you know,
of the root and tuba program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by FAO, where they got four
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was one of the members of the team
to review the cassava and also the other
[SPEAKER_00]: root and tubas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the concerns was with the
national programs, like Tanzania and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the phenotyping facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compare it with research
stations, the facilities are very
[SPEAKER_00]: inadequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation, fields are full of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get good phenotyping data
when you have very limited readers with
[SPEAKER_00]: limited facilities and trying to get
reliable phenotyping data, let's say in a
[SPEAKER_00]: country like Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second was, is the program, for example,
the breeding program between SEAT and
[SPEAKER_00]: IITA, is it integrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have any comments, each one
trying to do their own thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I hope there are no very easy
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try the second part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first part, yes, capacity building in
Africa is a very, it's almost a crisis
[SPEAKER_02]: situation, not to be too alarmist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why a project, a next
generation project has made it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: point of duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That right now, we are having like 10
graduate students PhD for cassava.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are here in Cornell,
but some are in different universities,
[SPEAKER_02]: also like University of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to raise that capacity,
because what you are saying is the truth
[SPEAKER_02]: is really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to deal with it rather than run
away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is going to breed cassava in Tanzania
if you're gonna have Tanzania cassava
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also hope that even in the future,
as we move on, we will, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a project, the project will soon come
to an end on the first phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are having a second phase,
we still think that capacity building is a
[SPEAKER_02]: big thing that we are not going to drop,
because we need it to make that progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, the project ends, and that's
the end of the story, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but having said that, you still have
some people who are beautiful breeders in
[SPEAKER_01]: Tanzania, let me be specific, Kido Tunda,
Henrico Kulelbega, Joffrey Camilo,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at that, let me stop at those three.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they lack is not the human capacity
per se by themselves, because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: already trained and they have PhDs,
but they don't have the resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Luke and I went to Henrico's lab at
the Spears in April 2016, and it was very
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew what they needed, or we think we
know what they needed, at least for a
[SPEAKER_02]: start, before they move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need support for them, and this
project is going to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody has any project that you can
also use to support, it may not even take
[SPEAKER_01]: too much money, but it's a matter of
resources and in terms of equipment or
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation materials, for example,
and they will begin to grow from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the IT and the CRT integration,
I think there have been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges in the past, and it did not
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even at that time that I said we
introduced materials between, from SIA to
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, those were difficult times,
but we're still able to make that happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with the support of IT.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has improved greatly in the recent
past, and it's all human factor of people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have chosen to work together better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask how integrated they are,
they are integrated in various forms,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it depends on the way you see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will use an example of HapS Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well integrated for HapS Plus as a
project and as a breeding program,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereby most of the germplasm or genetic
stocks for vitamin A, cassava,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sea ants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we'll generate a lot of them and
move to IIT.
[SPEAKER_01]: IIT will do some pre-breeding to introduce
resistance and share with the national
[SPEAKER_01]: programs in Nigeria and Diyarpungu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that's a perfect scenario and
it's working perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue of the trimethyl and carotene
content in HapS Plus, perhaps it might
[SPEAKER_04]: rely on abscisic acid, because the
tangenic approaches to increase carotene
[SPEAKER_04]: results in increased levels of KVA and
reduced trimethyl content.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the work that you are doing in
identifying the markers for trimethyl
[SPEAKER_04]: content and carotene, can you pick or have
you measured AVA to see if that leakage is
[SPEAKER_04]: through AVA?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ismael is going to be doing a bit of work
in
[SPEAKER_02]: Tanzania next week, or next weekend,
or this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you participate and I'm sure he's
interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Genozi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a little different in pad,
so thanks for changing it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm curious about the preferences that
you mentioned for farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned that at Harvest Plus they
found out about the dry matter mass at the
[SPEAKER_07]: end of it, and the farmers weren't as
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think NextGen is linking up
with other projects to find out what are
[SPEAKER_07]: the preferences that are desirable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, one of the, we have some special
initiatives in NextGen, and one of them is
[SPEAKER_02]: gender responsive, as I've already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we chose Harvest Plus as an example of
where we can do that, so it's like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers we are working with in that
study, they all have Harvest Plus in their
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers, and they are working with a
higher level data center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious about whether or not the
solid readers are interested in the week,
[SPEAKER_05]: or whether that's been left by the
wayside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me use this opportunity to
advertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to the grad students this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we mention it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many readers are existing now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they having a good handle on the roots
matter, which most people consume?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, so who's going to work on the
roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a good study for, it's a good
gender study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing is that it's the
obvious person by name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, so we play around with this emphasis
in all our endosperm crops to make them
[SPEAKER_05]: yellow and vitamin A rich, and we've got
leaves and they've got vitamin A in them,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're not, I mean, I guess sometimes
I'm confused by this, I guess this love
[SPEAKER_05]: affair with yellow starch.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time we got to yellow starch,
we were white starch, so they need to move
[SPEAKER_02]: from the white starch to the yellow starch
to connect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have the question, will they
grow, will they accept, will they grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Nigeria had a civil war in
the 60s, 60s, 70s, and there was farming
[SPEAKER_02]: in the southeastern part where I happen to
come from, and it was big time farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all eating cassava leaves,
but the war is over, nobody's eating
[SPEAKER_01]: cassava leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very imaginative, very, very
imaginative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they eat, you count the number of
communities, but not to say Sierra Leone
[SPEAKER_01]: is a vegetable, so it's big time,
and DRC is a vegetable, but if you cross
[SPEAKER_01]: those countries, you probably don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to do a cultural change,
and it's a promotional thing, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, but somebody has got to promote
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people need to move their other leafy
vegetables and focus on cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody has got to make a move,
and we are looking for those kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, because the vitamin A in cassava
leaves is so huge that you don't need any
[SPEAKER_02]: of those actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make people move from using
other leaves to use cassava leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had mentioned some projects looking at
trying to identify the emissary of the
[SPEAKER_06]: whitefly resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know, is there a lot of variation
for whitefly resistance tolerance among
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties, and if so, what kind of the
genetic basis of that might be?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much knowledge are there about that,
how feasible that is?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a study that just happened,
a student from Tanzania is doing a study,
[SPEAKER_02]: and is having that study partners in
Uganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot has been done in the past in
that area, so this is still a whole new
[SPEAKER_02]: area that is happening now, because people
are not also interested in that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we believe it was going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are having interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to have seen one of the scans
that are showing the same chromosome for
[SPEAKER_02]: CBSD having hits for whitefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of genetic variation that
we can use as part of the control strategy
[SPEAKER_02]: for the diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: The baseline for consumption of leaves is
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been eating cassava leaves for
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The experience is that you cannot change
much the diet of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: One alternative would be to encourage
people to eat more cassava leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an attempt that is very
reasonable, but it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you try to move these, people stick
to what they have eaten for the last 100
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Point two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaves have more carotene, but the
bioavailability is very low compared with
[SPEAKER_04]: the bioavailability of carotene in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our possibilities of intervention is
what can we make for people to get more
[SPEAKER_04]: access to carotene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the irritability is very high,
and the trick is very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make people eat carotene when they
eat the 500 grams of carotene that they
[SPEAKER_04]: eat every day of their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a reasonable thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not against the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using carotene, consuming carotene from
the leaves, but the fastest way to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: carotene to the mouth is through the
roots, not through the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the 50% of the world that eats
rice, where yellow doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm coming from that part of the world
where the idea of yellow stretch isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: working, didn't work, and destroys
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in fact, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like the dialogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being contingent later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, Valios is here from CI.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get enough cassava today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday at what time?
[SPEAKER_03]: At 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So watch for the announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's thank Shinose for a great talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
