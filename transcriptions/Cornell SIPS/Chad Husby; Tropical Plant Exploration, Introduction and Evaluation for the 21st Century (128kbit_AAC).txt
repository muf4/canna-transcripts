[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's a real honor to be here and you
know there's some fascinating connections
[SPEAKER_01]: between South Florida and Cornell that I
want to first introduce you to before
[SPEAKER_01]: delving into our topic here and this first
photo actually gives a hint of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a scene from the opening day of
Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time called Fairchild Tropical Garden in
1938 and a great figure from Cornell was
[SPEAKER_01]: there Dr. Liberty High Bailey and he's
standing right next to David Fairchild for
[SPEAKER_01]: whom the garden was named and then there
was Robert Montgomery who was the impetus
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the founding of a lot of these
gardens in South Florida and they all were
[SPEAKER_01]: converging in one place and I want to
share with you some of the great little
[SPEAKER_01]: passages that I've been able to unearth
from our archives of what these figures
[SPEAKER_01]: had to say about each other and the times
they were they were in and so this is
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert Montgomery who actually provided
the funds and the land for these gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: in South Florida who was originally from
Connecticut and was a self-taught
[SPEAKER_01]: accountant and tax lawyer whose hobby was
trees and you know he had a gift for a
[SPEAKER_01]: great compelling titles for books you can
see there are 50 years of accountancy with
[SPEAKER_01]: his autobiography and but he had a great
understated sense of sense of humor as
[SPEAKER_01]: well but he was mentioning how at the
opening of the garden the great figures
[SPEAKER_01]: who got it started including he mentioned
Dr. Bailey first and Dr. Fairchild some
[SPEAKER_01]: other great figures here of the botanical
world and of that time and publishing
[SPEAKER_01]: world and but he says if you're not
thrilled I'm sorry for you garden so and
[SPEAKER_01]: this was a photo that David Fairchild took
of Dr. Bailey's address at the at the
[SPEAKER_01]: inauguration of the garden so there's Dr.
Bailey there it's pretty dark but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that was him and the 23rd of March in 1938
and and these were some key words that Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey shared with the assembled crowd
there that the garden was he had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: admiration for David Fairchild who and
they went back a long ways to another
[SPEAKER_01]: land-grant institution Michigan State
University where where Dr. Bailey studied
[SPEAKER_01]: and where David Fairchild grew up because
his father was there and and so but and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bailey wanted this garden not only to
be a great honor to Dr. Fairchild and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot but also to be a place for
rejuvenation and to into study the
[SPEAKER_01]: processes of nature in the tropics and
this was and Dr. Bailey came repeatedly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the latter years of his life to the annual
members meetings standing next to no
[SPEAKER_01]: Montgomery Jennings Robert Montgomery's
wife and down there in South Florida 1939
[SPEAKER_01]: the next year and and then later in 1947
Dr. Bailey came with his with his daughter
[SPEAKER_01]: also had a big role to play here and you
know in the Bailey Hortorium and that so
[SPEAKER_01]: some beautiful words about about their
history together that he was a little boy
[SPEAKER_01]: at Michigan Agricultural College back then
when he was able to see Dr. Bailey at work
[SPEAKER_01]: when he was only a little boy and then
seven years later was able to honor him
[SPEAKER_01]: and have him speak of the garden that was
named after Dr. Fairchild and and so this
[SPEAKER_01]: part was here he just said etc etc from
all the different accomplishments of Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey but you know but he says when he
was reading what what he had done it would
[SPEAKER_01]: have been a shorter task to talk about
what he had not done and and then he went
[SPEAKER_01]: on to talk about the great emotion of that
moment when he was when if I thought it
[SPEAKER_01]: was and turned out to be the last time
that Dr. Bailey would come to the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and he also said that them you know I do
not I do not think you can blame me if I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel the emotion of this moment the
romance of this event which we have with
[SPEAKER_01]: us today not only the great liberty high
Bailey but his world-known and
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguished daughter Ethel Zoe who has
been the life companion and botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant of her father through the
wonderful years of his botanical and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural explorations and and he was
proud to have lived to see this moment and
[SPEAKER_01]: proud to introduce these two great forces
in the realm of growing plants and and
[SPEAKER_01]: then at the end we don't actually know if
he said all this because because at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end he had this little note he said this
is what he wanted to say but you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: would forget to say something so it's
always fun looking at archives because you
[SPEAKER_01]: get to hear their voices and and Dr.
Fairchild visited Cornell in 1938 after
[SPEAKER_01]: the opening of the garden so these are
some photos in our archive from that visit
[SPEAKER_01]: in June of the of the Bailey Hortorium
plantings at that time some raised beds
[SPEAKER_01]: they had there and there's Ethel Zoe
working with another assistant of Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey's and in the workroom and and then
Liberty High Bailey also had great
[SPEAKER_01]: admiration for David Fairchild which now
he's everybody you know it's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to think of how these these figures at
that time were really major public
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectuals major public you know people
who were interpreting science to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public whereas today you know we don't
hear as many horticultural figures who've
[SPEAKER_01]: reached this status and so it was kind of
refreshing to know that there was a time
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully hopefully will be again they
both wrote these very influential and
[SPEAKER_01]: quite popular books like this was about he
was reviewing David Fairchild's and
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciating David Fairchild's exploring
for plants his first book David Fairchild
[SPEAKER_01]: only wrote four books and we had Bailey
wrote many more and mentioning how just
[SPEAKER_01]: his enthusiasm and the way he expressed
himself was something that was very
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing and charming and and then the
Fairchild garden has a beautiful part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden that's actually dedicated to
Dr. Bailey the Bailey Palm Glade and like
[SPEAKER_01]: the Fairchild wrote a very long and
beautiful appreciation of Liberty High
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey as part of his effort to raise
support for construction of this which
[SPEAKER_01]: still is a central part of the garden and
and once again reflecting on on what he
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced as a little boy on the campus
of in Michigan State Agricultural College
[SPEAKER_01]: and where he first experienced
horticulture under the auspices of
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Bailey and and Professor
Bailey's latter life he focused a lot on
[SPEAKER_01]: palms which were a big part of why these
gardens in South Florida came to be
[SPEAKER_01]: because Robert Montgomery was a real poem
enthusiast when he got tired of the
[SPEAKER_01]: winters in the northeast he bought a
winter home and started collecting poems
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of correspondence between
him and Dr. Bailey about which palms to
[SPEAKER_01]: include in the collection and and then
that turned into a eventually a public
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and and so they mentioning that he
was mentioning that this is a reason why
[SPEAKER_01]: they needed a center for palms here in the
tropics in South Florida and this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the early 40s the when they were
just constructing the Liberty the Bailey
[SPEAKER_01]: Palm Glade and then what it looks like
today so it's grown in quite a bit since
[SPEAKER_01]: then and it wasn't that much the worst for
where after the hurricane so we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: more planting to do there and this is the
memorial plaque that's at the at the
[SPEAKER_01]: overlook there for the Bailey Palm Glade
and we also have the privilege of
[SPEAKER_01]: featuring of one of the most spectacular
palms in the world which is named after
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Bailey Copernica Bailiana the Bailey
Palm from Cuba and it said as it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: older it develops this wonderful trunk
that looks like almost like a concrete
[SPEAKER_01]: pillar and it's a slow growing palm but
very robust and has this beautifully
[SPEAKER_01]: geometrical crown the leaves are very
stiff very fan like and it's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most prized palms that there is so is it
definitely I am a great honor and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things one of the letters I found
between Fairchild and Bailey was about
[SPEAKER_01]: like what's going to happen with them
after they after they pass on and others
[SPEAKER_01]: have to take up the work and in many ways
that's what we're all doing we're carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: on the work of these great founders of
these institutions and and there's still a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of progress being made as as Professor
Bailey predicted here that the sum of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effort despite the fact that we all have
our own interests and our own foci we're
[SPEAKER_01]: still bringing things forward and that
brings us to the tropics and which is
[SPEAKER_01]: where most of the action is in the plant
kingdom and we know that even more
[SPEAKER_01]: precisely than we did back back in the
days of Fairchild and Bailey that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: in basically the entire North temperate
forest area we have about 1166 tree
[SPEAKER_01]: species but in half a square kilometer in
Borneo you have actually more tree species
[SPEAKER_01]: there's and and also in Ecuador about that
same same number of tree species so the
[SPEAKER_01]: tropics are unbelievably rich compared to
the temperate zone so that's where most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most of the plants are and most of the
threatened plants as you would expect are
[SPEAKER_01]: also in that area where where the plants
are and and David Fairchild wrote quite
[SPEAKER_01]: poetically about the importance of
understanding and exploring the tropics
[SPEAKER_01]: that he you know he grew up in Michigan up
in the North temperate zone and also spent
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of his career in Washington DC
working for the US Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture but got a chance early on to
start traveling through the tropics and to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that the tropics are where where you
find most of the plants and most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: remarkable animal diversity so it really
you can't know life on earth without
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing the tropics and and also toward
the end of his life Liberty High Bailey
[SPEAKER_01]: was was spending more and more time in the
tropics studying palms and this is showing
[SPEAKER_01]: him in the pressing palm specimens in
Florida and but this was when he was he
[SPEAKER_01]: was in his 80s and he was in Trinidad
working with palms and he was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how being there despite the
discomfort extends the boundaries of life
[SPEAKER_01]: so that because the world is such a big
place in such an incredibly diverse place
[SPEAKER_01]: to explore in the tropics and so we have a
lot of plant work to explore a lot of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's still most of those plants in
the tropics haven't been cultivated even
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the useful ones haven't been
brought back yet but there are challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: because even though there are lots of
things that make working with plants
[SPEAKER_01]: easier in the modern era there are some
things that make it more difficult many
[SPEAKER_01]: countries have implemented a lot of
restrictions on collecting from the wild
[SPEAKER_01]: due to changes in intellectual property
laws and perspectives worldwide which led
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Convention on Biological Diversity
and other United Nations conventions and
[SPEAKER_01]: that have led countries to want to make it
harder to access their biodiversity and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're becoming more and more aware of the
potential risks to ecological concerns of
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced plants and animals some of them
we know that have become problems in
[SPEAKER_01]: various regions of the world and various
concerns about also the problems caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: by pests that come along with plants have
led to increasing complexity of import
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions and the US Department of
Agriculture for many years has had
[SPEAKER_01]: basically an innocent until proven guilty
approach with plants and they're gradually
[SPEAKER_01]: shifting to a guilty until proven innocent
approach so various genera are being
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibited from entry now that didn't used
to be and there's a they put together all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the current regulations of the USDA are
in one document now you can find as a PDF
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunately because it's all it's already
over 1,200 pages long so it's it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated to navigate than ever but it's
still possible to do a lot of work and so
[SPEAKER_01]: to elaborate a little bit on some of these
challenges of the 21st century we're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of transition for most of human
heritage for most of human history plants
[SPEAKER_01]: moved pretty fit pretty freely worldwide
indigenous peoples tended to bring their
[SPEAKER_01]: useful plants from place to place like the
breadfruit is a famous example moving
[SPEAKER_01]: across the Pacific people often brought
their useful plant you know the blood corn
[SPEAKER_01]: moved into the Americas from Mexico by the
various indigenous peoples and and most
[SPEAKER_01]: countries rely on foreign plants for their
most of their food and fiber and other
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and and most of when
varieties would then be improved and
[SPEAKER_01]: selected they would be free to be shared
with everyone as starting in the early 80s
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when patenting of jeans and
patenting of living things started to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: big factor that became actually legal
first in the US and then in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: developed worlds instead of these improved
varieties being being freely shared to
[SPEAKER_01]: those countries for example from which the
original germplasm came they were now
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold back to those countries that
were being forced to to abide by the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent regimes of the developed worlds and
this led to to those countries restricting
[SPEAKER_01]: access not wanting their germplasm to be
moved out of their country and then freely
[SPEAKER_01]: and then being sold back to them that was
understandably seen as as what's called
[SPEAKER_01]: biopiracy and and so this is a good little
summary of the state of things by a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful international lawyer Sabrina
Safran who negotiated some of these trees
[SPEAKER_01]: on behalf of the United States and has
done written probably the best articles
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining how things have changed and how
they might change in the future that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically we we have moved from a plate
from this world where where things where
[SPEAKER_01]: it was basically a commons free of freely
available genetic resources weren't the
[SPEAKER_01]: property of governments they weren't the
property of corporations and now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: not only governments and corporations but
also often many times indigenous peoples
[SPEAKER_01]: are also claiming claiming ownership of
their genetic resources to in hopes that
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't get they won't get taken by
these other entities so and then those of
[SPEAKER_01]: us who are working with with plants for
horticulture with plants for for basic
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific research research often get
caught in the middle of these forces that
[SPEAKER_01]: are still still being worked out today so
that's something that's still in progress
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll talk a little bit more about
that later but I want to mention the
[SPEAKER_01]: another of the big factors that's changed
in our perception of how we deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is the issue of invasive species
the issue of native versus non-native
[SPEAKER_01]: species and much of this debate hinges on
philosophy as much as science and values
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of public policy issues that
interface with science or issues of value
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as they are of actual data but we
a few years ago we did a little study to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to to try to actually include some
data in consideration of this issue we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at plants that the Fairchild garden
had distributed as part of its plant sales
[SPEAKER_01]: and distributions in the early days before
from 1955 to 1979 that was before there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a much concern about about non-native
plants and invasive plants and we matched
[SPEAKER_01]: them with ex situ conservation species
that had come into the garden since then
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in nature were more restricted and
were brought in for other purposes besides
[SPEAKER_01]: just vigor in cultivation and
interestingly enough we found that there
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly were some differences that in
this we'd use this system called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian weed risk assessment system
which you can adapt to different regions
[SPEAKER_01]: which uses a you score a bunch of
different variables like how prolific it
[SPEAKER_01]: is you know whether how widespread it is
in nature how its seeds are dispersed
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot what environments it grows in and
it's a way to integrate all that
[SPEAKER_01]: information into a risk assessment and and
so basically there are several categories
[SPEAKER_01]: there's except which is the clear area
here and then there's evaluate further
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning there's not enough there's some
concern but there's not enough information
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's reject and of all the
species we evaluated there was only one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those horticultural introductions that was
in the reject category there were more
[SPEAKER_01]: that were in the evaluate category and in
the conservation species there was only
[SPEAKER_01]: one that was in the evaluation category so
it wasn't there weren't a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants falling into a high-risk category
and in fact even those that were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate category were just just barely
above zero which is the cutoff so whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: the conservation species were well below
so generally we were the risk didn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: to be all that great although there are
certainly of the thousands of species that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been introduced into the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: a few have become problems some of them
here of course and some of them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: more tropical areas but I think it's
important to keep it and put it in context
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need to be aware of that some
species will pose a risk but that most
[SPEAKER_01]: know and and so I think that's a good
baseline to to use for starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate whether plants whether you know
how we how we interface with non-native
[SPEAKER_01]: species and there's also the danger of
guilt by association that sometimes people
[SPEAKER_01]: we know some of the earliest introductions
of a given family or given genus was
[SPEAKER_01]: usually easiest to grow and so that was
the most likely to be a problem and then
[SPEAKER_01]: all other members of that group kind of
tend to be looked down on later and such
[SPEAKER_01]: as the Australian pines the casuarinas in
Florida are considered quite quite
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive and they certainly score very
high on the Australian weed risk
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment but then in the same family
that looks fairly similar at gymnastoma
[SPEAKER_01]: which ecologically is very very different
though it's a very close relative of the
[SPEAKER_01]: casuarinas that scores a low risk and it's
been in Hawaii for 50 years and hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been a problem and I think that's a good
baseline if it's in Hawaii for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and hasn't spread because just about any
plant can find a niche in Hawaii that it
[SPEAKER_01]: likes so but once again if we were to just
kind of say well all the plants in this
[SPEAKER_01]: family must be bad because when genus was
bad we would be writing off a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful plants and very that aren't a
risk but despite you know some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges that complicate plant
introduction there's there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: factors in the modern world that make
plant introduction actually facilitated
[SPEAKER_01]: and such as the rapidity of transportation
even you know 50 years ago it was much
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to move plants quickly and you know
when you're taking cuttings or whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plants how long they spend in a dark box
or on a ship or on a cargo hold of a plane
[SPEAKER_01]: and what temperature the cargo hold of the
plane is those are all big limitations on
[SPEAKER_01]: what on how much success you will have and
the exchange of botanical and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural information is just risen
exponentially so now people can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about what plants might be promising for
food what might be promising for as
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful plants or what plants might be
even risky as an invasive all that
[SPEAKER_01]: information is so much more rapidly
available now we can really collaborate
[SPEAKER_01]: with people overseas so much more easily
and that and that's facilitated things
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit and and there is a growing
interest in in tropical plant diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Asia there's a there's a
Thailand has just exploded in the last 15
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years with interest you know there are
small nurseries going all kinds of amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants there China has become actually a
great great economic engine for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that horticultural activity in Thailand
and elsewhere because there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: demand now as the economy has improved
there and there's a lot of appreciation
[SPEAKER_01]: for the beauty of tropical plants same in
Japan and and in certain segments of even
[SPEAKER_01]: in the US there's increasing interest for
example in the world of aeroids we just
[SPEAKER_01]: had a big aeroid show at Fairchild Garden
and we were everybody was commenting on
[SPEAKER_01]: how many young people were there because
they're now popular houseplants and people
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting excited about all the
different types that can be available and
[SPEAKER_01]: can be grown and and horticulture
fortunately provides a way to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: the changing international regime of
accessing plant genetic resources because
[SPEAKER_01]: many countries view horticulture very
differently than they view going directly
[SPEAKER_01]: to the wild and collecting something for a
scientific project because some countries
[SPEAKER_01]: are fostering the development of their own
horticultural industries and they of
[SPEAKER_01]: course want them to be able to sell plants
overseas and they see the benefits of that
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back to their countries in the form
of money which is the easiest benefit to
[SPEAKER_01]: see and countries like Ecuador where be
very difficult it's often very challenging
[SPEAKER_01]: you get permits to do anything that
requires bringing plants back but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: work with nurseries there they can bring a
wonderful new plants into cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: that can then be freely shared and for the
for the benefit and enjoyment of all and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening in many many countries
because it's a way that country seed
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits from their biodiversity coming
back to their country and we can benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: by enjoying those plants in horticulture
and and that's that's pretty encouraging
[SPEAKER_01]: and countries like Thailand especially are
showing just the tremendous potential of
[SPEAKER_01]: that where a huge economic sectors of the
economy are are being built on this and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically the plant biodiversity and
enjoyment of it and and another another
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect that's becoming uh at least more
more appreciated in the botanical garden
[SPEAKER_01]: world and is starting to actually be
appreciated internationally is that
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction of new plants can sometimes
save species and save genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: because sometimes there's a growing number
of cases where one person or one
[SPEAKER_01]: institution just with interest in growing
a plant that's endangered or rare in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wild has saved that plant and that plant
could then be repatriated to the country
[SPEAKER_01]: of origin showing that you know the plant
introduction effort can have you know huge
[SPEAKER_01]: huge conservation benefits and plants that
are now very very rare in the wild as when
[SPEAKER_01]: people are now within the advent of
genetic technology for looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: population genetics have they've been
discovering that some of these old garden
[SPEAKER_01]: collections have alleles that are now no
longer found in the wild population
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a one interesting recent case is
the double coconut and the world produces
[SPEAKER_01]: the world's largest seed and their old
collections in the Singapore in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Singapore Botanic Garden that were
introduced in the 30s and when they
[SPEAKER_01]: started doing population genetics they
found quite a few alleles in that in those
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated plants that aren't found in the
Seychelles where it's native anymore so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been able to extend the genetic
conservation of that of that species and
[SPEAKER_01]: some very very rare species are able to be
backed up in cultivation the entire you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all their genetic diversity because
you can take cuttings from all the extant
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and grow them in a fairly small
space in the greenhouse and you know make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that however whatever happens with
the pressures on the native environment
[SPEAKER_01]: there will at least be a backup of that
genetic diversity that can be returned
[SPEAKER_01]: once things stabilize in situ and and we
certainly need more diversity in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: of food and ornamental plants and just
plants are appreciated for their wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: because despite all the advances in
agriculture and horticulture in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: century we still only 12 crops are
supplying 80% of the world's food and when
[SPEAKER_01]: we have 30,000 species that are known to
be edible and that's just with edible
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that doesn't include medicinal
plants and all the other and this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: example at Fairchild we have a major
program of mango diversity and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: over 300 mango cultivars at off-sites
garden that we have and each July we
[SPEAKER_01]: feature this tremendous cultivar diversity
all the flavors and textures when most
[SPEAKER_01]: people experience mangoes especially in
temperate climates they you know they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just having one usually one cultivar that
ships well that has a lot of fiber in it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not nowhere near as nice as a mango
can be and whereas the potential for this
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit is tremendous and then there are
many fruits whose potential has been far
[SPEAKER_01]: less explored than the mango and and one
that one of the places where this there's
[SPEAKER_01]: been an interface between conservation and
and food has been the breadfruit Institute
[SPEAKER_01]: at the National Tropical Botanic Garden
Hawaii and this is an example of where one
[SPEAKER_01]: person dr. Diane Rogoni who did her PhD on
breadfruit in the Pacific back in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s she went throughout the Pacific and
collected fruits from the different
[SPEAKER_01]: islands and brought them back to the
National Tropical Botanic Garden and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the succeeding years there are many of
those islands where they're as as their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures are going through urbanization
and different economic changes they would
[SPEAKER_01]: lose their native breadfruit cultivars
that had been developed on their
[SPEAKER_01]: individual islands but many of those were
saved at the breadfruit Institute and then
[SPEAKER_01]: be returned to those islands and also made
available for feeding hungry people
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the tropics and now tissue
culturing several new varieties each year
[SPEAKER_01]: and just making them freely available to
countries in the world that that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in this very nutritious and
low-maintenance food that which you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow just by anywhere where there isn't
where there isn't frost or cold weather
[SPEAKER_01]: and and some other really great examples
of how horticulture can actually save
[SPEAKER_01]: species through through just some
enthusiasm and through sometimes moving
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants around out of their out of
where they were native this is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a hibiscus relative in Hawaii that
just thanks to a few people who decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: graft it it's not not in danger of extinct
going extinct anymore and there's only a
[SPEAKER_01]: few genotypes left but it was just down to
one tree several and several times several
[SPEAKER_01]: occasions and if they hadn't brought it to
the botanic gardens it would be extinct
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the few modern horticulturists
to make it to celebrity status a good
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine Carlos Magdalena of Q
Gardens has become a bit you know a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a celebrity by saving some really
prominent plants from extinction plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that were sometimes called the living dead
where they're down to one individual and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't propagate it they may have a
disease that's slowing down its metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: like this is that which was the case with
this beautiful coffee relative Ramos Mani
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodriguez which is endemic to the island
of Mauritius and he kept trying to torture
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant different individuals of
this plant that would not set seed on its
[SPEAKER_01]: own and there was only one clone left and
eventually growing one you know in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way that was a little stressful he
got one one seed to develop a viable
[SPEAKER_01]: embryo and the germinated and then he
could cross that ceiling with appearance
[SPEAKER_01]: and because he just would not give up on
this beautiful rare plant and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: because he had tremendous resources behind
him to do this a lot of staff to help him
[SPEAKER_01]: it was because he cared and that's I think
a very empowering message about plant
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation is that even though in many
cases it's hard to influence governments
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to influence international
trends but one person can make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for a species and I think
that's a that's a beautiful aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture that we need to talk about
more and a recent example of this even
[SPEAKER_01]: more recent is just happened in the wake
of Hurricane Maria which struck Puerto
[SPEAKER_01]: Rico late last year they got hit much
harder than we did in South Florida we had
[SPEAKER_01]: the the edge of Hurricane Irma and but
Hurricane Maria was just devastated Puerto
[SPEAKER_01]: Rico and one of its endemic potato and
tomato relatives so let solanum
[SPEAKER_01]: encephalium was down to just a few
individuals that were left at a few sites
[SPEAKER_01]: and after the storm none of those could be
found again they seemed to all have been
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed and a graduate student who was
working on the endemic solanaceae of
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Rico was able to just search online
and find out that of all places the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Connecticut their wonderful
research collection and teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: collection had two clones of this that had
been grown at Fairchild Garden up until
[SPEAKER_01]: the mid-2000s it was probably Hurricane
Wilma that did those plants in but
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunately a student who'd been studying
them from the northeast took cuttings got
[SPEAKER_01]: brought them up to Connecticut and they
were maintained there at the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching collection and as far as we know
these two individuals are the last of the
[SPEAKER_01]: species and it was just because a couple
people decided to propagate it it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be around to hopefully repatriate to
Puerto Rico we of course we all hope that
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll reappear in Puerto Rico so that
there will be more genetic diversity but
[SPEAKER_01]: at least we have a couple of individuals
that are cuttings from wild wild plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is one that was just sent back
down to Fairchild from the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut so now that we know how
important this is we're trying to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: spread as far as we can to make sure that
it's um it won't be lost to posterity and
[SPEAKER_01]: to nature and lest you think that this is
that these are just you know isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotes if we look at the best
documented cases of extinction and an
[SPEAKER_01]: extinction in the wild where it also
exists in horticulture based on the IUCN's
[SPEAKER_01]: red list they've documented 101 plant
species extinct we know many more are
[SPEAKER_01]: extinct there are many extinct that will
never know that they existed but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the only these are the only hard numbers
we really have now and but but in addition
[SPEAKER_01]: there are 35 species they're extinct in
the wild but survive in cultivation so
[SPEAKER_01]: without horticulture that means there'd be
29% higher extinction rate for plants
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas with animals the same figures are
less than 5% plants are have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages you can take cuttings you know
of them so you can clone them very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't need a lot of space you know
you can grow a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in a small space they're the
most you know they're wonderfully
[SPEAKER_01]: exchangeable they're easy to send long
distances so we can we can do a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: with plants and the potential to conserve
them through horticulture is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive and this is not through any
concerted effort this is just through a
[SPEAKER_01]: disorganized group of gardeners botanic
gardens and universities across the world
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this imagine what could be done if
we actually put our minds to it and
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinated so as a botanic garden we
introduce plants from a from a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: sources I'm going to give a couple
examples of how that's done in the modern
[SPEAKER_01]: era we do the traditional way which is
wild collecting expeditions also
[SPEAKER_01]: exchanging with other botanic gardens
commercial nurseries and private
[SPEAKER_01]: collectors those are the main sources and
they go to a gardens nursery where we do
[SPEAKER_01]: our first stage of evaluation trying to
keep them alive keep the propagules alive
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing how easy they are to propagate
and then there are all kinds of uses in a
[SPEAKER_01]: modern botanical garden and in other
botanical institutions that they may be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for education research beauty
conservation and evaluation for the
[SPEAKER_01]: broader use in horticulture and so while
collecting expeditions as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: they're harder they're getting harder all
the time in most countries and even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're allowed to collect many times they
want to make agreements that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive with regard to what can later
be done with those plants so you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: in this new area need to carefully
negotiate to make sure that everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: interests are respected and and so in some
countries we've had a little more latitude
[SPEAKER_01]: to collect than others we have we have a
great relationship with the Dominican
[SPEAKER_01]: Republic with the botanic garden there and
we made a couple of expeditions there in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2012 and 2013 and this is what just you
know like plant collecting was in the old
[SPEAKER_01]: days we're going out and collecting
cuttings and seeds and using interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: conveyances and sometimes it's a pickup
truck and there's no room for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: delicate things we just pile them on top
of ourselves and bring them back and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them inspected for for pests in the
country of origin and packed up very
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully and brought back labeled
accessions and hopefully they'll survive
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the our successful
introductions was this is clavia
[SPEAKER_01]: domingensis which is endemic to Haiti
which is a lot of conservation struggles
[SPEAKER_01]: in the modern era it's about 98 percent
deforested and this is a species that's
[SPEAKER_01]: down to just a handful of individuals it's
a very beautiful ornamental and and the
[SPEAKER_01]: botanic garden the Dominican Republic has
been propagating it for a number of years
[SPEAKER_01]: from early collections they made and
they've been sharing propagations with
[SPEAKER_01]: other gardens throughout the world and now
we have a number of those we have about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals growing at Fairchild and we
think they'll flower flower soon and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been working with the Botanic Garden of
Haiti to make more wild collections from
[SPEAKER_01]: the handful of remaining individuals to
make sure we can serve as much genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity as possible and we worked with
our partners there to make the first
[SPEAKER_01]: successful horticultural introduction of a
special plumeria species plumeria magna
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest fragile panties there
is it can get to be 90 feet tall and and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Botanic Garden there had not been
successful in grafting or drafting them or
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating them from cuttings so we we've
had success now and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing them back on our next trip to the
Botanic Garden there so they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use them in plantings in the Dominican
Republic where it's native we've had some
[SPEAKER_01]: neat follow-up opportunities on some of
the things that David Fairchild dreamed
[SPEAKER_01]: about that weren't possible in his time
but are possible now we have trouble in
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the deep tropics growing the
Mediterranean fig because we have trouble
[SPEAKER_01]: with the humidity and heat there it's um
they get a rust fungus they get nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's this uh several tropical figs
that are edible but most figs require
[SPEAKER_01]: their pollinator wasps to ripen and and be
palatable and certainly true of this this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the Roxburg fig ficus ariculata
sometimes called the coconut fig and but
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a few clones that actually are
what's called carcinocarpic like the
[SPEAKER_01]: banana where they will have like our
common Cavendish banana where the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: will ripen without being fertilized so
there aren't and without producing viable
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and it turns out that um one of our
neighboring gardens had inadvertently
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced one of these um collecting
plants after a hurricane in Indonesia one
[SPEAKER_01]: clone they brought back of this species
turns out to be carcinocarpic and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been propagating it David Fairchild he
wrote a whole article like when is anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do something about the great fig
of the Himalayas you know and he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant at his home at the Kampong he spent
years using all these tricks like using
[SPEAKER_01]: olive oil to slather the fruit and trying
to make it ripen it never worked and now
[SPEAKER_01]: we fortunately have one the one that he
would have wanted and similarly he was
[SPEAKER_01]: very keen on the potential of the sycamore
fig of the Middle East and in Africa which
[SPEAKER_01]: is a fig that thrives vegetatively in
South Florida and in tropical climates but
[SPEAKER_01]: also generally requires its pollinator
wasps but there's a variety that rose in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Middle East about 1600 years ago that
will ripen without pollination called
[SPEAKER_01]: balami and a collector in South Florida
worked about 30 years to get this into
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and finally did and shared
cuttings with us and they've made fruits
[SPEAKER_01]: that are quite tasty so and David
Fairchild also was trying for years with
[SPEAKER_01]: this species he had a one of the typical
form at his home and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional ways of making these ripen
going back to antiquity was to cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: small the figs when they were very very
tiny which would stimulate ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: production and make them ripen so he had
to cut individually each of the figs and
[SPEAKER_01]: he could never get the stage just right
and so he never succeeded and but now we
[SPEAKER_01]: have the one that you don't need to do
anything it will just ripen and we're also
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing plants that are of important
conservation value some of which require
[SPEAKER_01]: the collaboration of several institutions
to make a successful introduction this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a important conifer from New Caledonia
this is a kind of from New Caledonia is
[SPEAKER_01]: this lost world in the South Pacific with
46 I guess 47 now endemic conifer species
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tropics now the place we usually
associate with conifers but conifers
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to be one of the most endangered
plant groups in the world about 34 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of them are considered threatened or
endangered so that's an important group to
[SPEAKER_01]: be backing up in different collections and
so this was shared with with us by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal Botanic Gardens Edmonton borough and
then our colleagues at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida managed to graft it onto a
rootstock that's much better for our soils
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's too cold up there to grow this
outside year-round so they gave us this
[SPEAKER_01]: grafted individuals of plants in the
garden now so our three institutions have
[SPEAKER_01]: finally made this and some horticultural
expertise has made this possible to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this conserved ex situ and increasingly
we're going through this route of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture for plant introductions and
in Thailand is the epicenter for tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture and so we're going
increasingly every just every December to
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest plant show in Southeast Asia
the Rama 9 plant show and sale where
[SPEAKER_01]: basically anybody who's in the botanical
world and horticultural world in Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia tries to get to this and you get
probably about nearly a hundred vendors in
[SPEAKER_01]: this giant circle in this big park in
Bangkok and just you just it's
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelming what you'll find there all
the amazing plants and individual
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries specializing in plants of this
family and the NNAC specializing in
[SPEAKER_01]: podocarpus specializing in this just the
diversity is just fantastic and each time
[SPEAKER_01]: we go around we'll go around the first
time and find a whole bunch of things and
[SPEAKER_01]: think oh well we've got a few things we
still need to find the next day and we go
[SPEAKER_01]: around and it's not a few things it's
still just as many and then the next day
[SPEAKER_01]: we find even more and so it's just it's
pretty overwhelming what we can find and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's available now and also in the
various local nurseries in Thailand that
[SPEAKER_01]: are introducing all kinds of wonderful new
things to cultivation this is Kunsak who's
[SPEAKER_01]: a legendary collector from from that area
and to many things in this very favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: climate they're able to just use clear
plastic bags to root cuttings and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: things from leaf cuttings and grafts in
Thailand they graft so many things it's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing they're master grafts grafters
there and we can find nurseries with row
[SPEAKER_01]: after row of amazingly grown epiphytic
lycopods which is a pretty amazing thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to see and and just that these are now all
available and as as beautiful specimens
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be shipped to the US is pretty
pretty amazing and so fortunately our
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand is set up for for horticultural
introductions so everything is very very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient there we have a good friend and
colleague who comes to Miami several times
[SPEAKER_01]: home Sapa Siri Chauvin itch and he he's
able to get this all air freighted to
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami in about a day and a half and so
they have all the fire sanitary documents
[SPEAKER_01]: we go through all the regulations and you
know we're still able to get about 80%
[SPEAKER_01]: success this way sometimes even higher
depending on the type of plant and so last
[SPEAKER_01]: December we brought back 22 big boxes of
new plants this way and we're gonna keep
[SPEAKER_01]: at it as well the opportunities exist and
we also even have a growing network of
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange with botanical institutions
overseas as well this was a botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: garden north of Bangkok that gave us
several of their endemic plants trees of
[SPEAKER_01]: limestone areas around there which we have
very similar substrates in Miami where a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of limestone and they were able to
give us an entire genus Santa Zucchia
[SPEAKER_01]: there are two species and they gave us
both of them so it's nice to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: complete collections and you know just
like in the old days plants collecting can
[SPEAKER_01]: be pretty messy this is a little apartment
in Singapore Botanic Garden where they let
[SPEAKER_01]: me stay they let me stay even after I've
done this multiple times and filled
[SPEAKER_01]: everything up with plants and then brought
them back in my in my luggage after they
[SPEAKER_01]: get get inspected and we get them back to
the garden and and you know even after a
[SPEAKER_01]: very rigorous trip you know then the work
has just begun we have to get all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: settled potted up put under mist or fog
and and try to get them into favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: microclimates and see if we can get most
of them to succeed and sometimes we even
[SPEAKER_01]: find plants that are they're very useful
that are that are new fruits like this is
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandorakum which is a very fluffy fruit
that they have all these new different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars in in Thailand of it but some of
these many of these plants we just bring
[SPEAKER_01]: back because they're wonderful and one
person who was influenced by Liberty High
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey was Wendell Berry and I think this
what he said about 20 years ago that that
[SPEAKER_01]: if we don't learn to value things just for
being wonderful in and of themselves we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lose a lot of them because a lot
of the current approach to conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot tends to be what is what are
things useful for are they useful for are
[SPEAKER_01]: they going to be useful for medicine food
or carbon storage or something but the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem is that all those things may come
and go but we still need this biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: for the future and we need to figure out
how to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How wonderful it is and one plant that
I've gotten extremely interested in is
[SPEAKER_01]: Ficus deltoidea which comes in all these
amazing local it's an epiphytic fig in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia that comes in all these
local leaf forms in different habitats and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all part of the same species but
they're they're all genetically distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see some that are big leaves some
of the small big figs small figs and and a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful example of just evolution in
action and that you can demonstrate by you
[SPEAKER_01]: know just growing a whole diverse range of
this individual species in the tropics and
[SPEAKER_01]: you introduce some very other promising
ornamentals like this beautiful grevillea
[SPEAKER_01]: that has golden leaf undersides most
grevilleas in the protease family don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: well in South Florida they don't like our
high pH soils but we discovered we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: this growing in several places in
Southeast Asia and said let's try it and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's turned out to be remarkably adaptable
and it's not sensitive to phosphorus like
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them are even going so so low as
to as to or so high as to appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: bryophytes and this is a liverworts
brought back a couple years ago that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: this beautiful central black portion that
illustrates its dichotomous branching and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's caused a bit of a sensation among
my growing liverwort community and
[SPEAKER_01]: salaginella is even this is what I call a
gateway salaginella so those of you who
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't gotten bitten by this incredibly
diverse lycophyte group this is
[SPEAKER_01]: salaginella picta from Vietnam it's a
recent introduction to horticulture and
[SPEAKER_01]: now that it's in Thailand it's being
propagated widely but it has its central
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves turn white very early in
development so it has this natural
[SPEAKER_01]: variation that's quite striking and it's
not that hard to grow and another this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a beautiful another beautifully primeval
endangered salaginella species from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines that's just entered
horticulture and is actually endangered in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild but they've been but it's
actually not that hard to grow and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just gorgeous it looks like it's made of
plastic and came right out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: paleozoic so as I mentioned many exchanges
with botanic gardens this is from a new
[SPEAKER_01]: species from the Solomon Islands of
horticarpus from the Royal Botanic Gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: Edinburgh that its new leaves look as
pretty as any flower so and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful palms that are coming into
horticulture that are just you know on the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of Bailey's wonderful palm and their
wonderful geometry some plants that look
[SPEAKER_01]: like palms but aren't palms this is a
cyclant from the Americas and this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: group of plants that has tremendous
horticultural potential that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: more appreciated in Asia than it is in the
new world for their for their tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and beauty and they're actually
more closely related to the pandans than
[SPEAKER_01]: to the palms but we're introducing a lot
more of these and evaluating how they do
[SPEAKER_01]: in horticulture some of the beautiful
plants from Mauritius this like this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that has these beautiful shiny small
leaves that look like oak leaves that we
[SPEAKER_01]: brought back from a collection in Thailand
that's never been grown in the US before
[SPEAKER_01]: but looks very very promising easy to
propagate we never get tired of iridescent
[SPEAKER_01]: blue plants this is a sedge from Southeast
Asia you know if you thought that sedges
[SPEAKER_01]: were just little nondescript green things
in the in the swamps this is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tropics they they can become really
spectacular this one has this special kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of iridescence based on the different
layers of silica on its leaves and gets
[SPEAKER_01]: the shiny blue color in the in the shady
areas and this is a curculigo a palm grass
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't a palm or a grass but the
types we've had in horticulture have been
[SPEAKER_01]: a pretty bland green but this is a wild
species from Southeast Asia that nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: had had it in horticulture until very
recently so there's so much potential out
[SPEAKER_01]: there so much to explore it's pretty
exciting in the tropics and like this
[SPEAKER_01]: potato and tomato relative of Solanum that
feels like velvet just really densely
[SPEAKER_01]: velvety leaves from Ecuador that got into
some collections through the Ecuadorian
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries and now you can find it in
Thailand they're enjoying it there as well
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a brand new interesting
introduction to North American
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture in Medinilla that when we
first just hung it in the conservatory at
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairchild a couple of weeks ago and the
Sun came through its leaves which are red
[SPEAKER_01]: in the back we saw this amazing effect
where the the red blending into the green
[SPEAKER_01]: you know gives this just wonderful kind of
orangey red glow to it so which no one
[SPEAKER_01]: else who's grown this genus before has
seen so you know we never know what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to discover when we introduce these
wonder these new wonders
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it hasn't flowered yet but some
Medinillas have pendulous flowers some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them have flowers on the stem so there's
all different some are more showy than
[SPEAKER_01]: others so we're no no that's actually just
the effect of the sunlight shining through
[SPEAKER_01]: the red background backs of the leaves so
it's actually it's basically green on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top and red underneath so yeah it's so
yeah in Thailand they're really into
[SPEAKER_01]: variegated plants so I'm not even going
there right now that would be that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be many lectures on the science of
variegation in Thailand and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave out some flowers even though I'm
a big fan of foliage but this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful and then AC ovaria that has this
mysterious resin that it produces in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of its flowers but it's pretty
spectacular and it also makes an edible
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit so it's not only gorgeous but edible
and there's also some active breathing
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in Southeast Asia and a lot of
popular plant groups and this is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most exciting new triumphs of a
wonderful horticulturist in Indonesia this
[SPEAKER_01]: is Grusina stardust JT stardust and it's a
hybrid between one Bornean species that
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps its spots all its life but is pretty
diminutive and one that has big beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: strap like leaves but it has spots early
on but then loses them when it matures so
[SPEAKER_01]: this one has the big strap like leaves and
it keeps its spots so it's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of the best of both species for
ornamental uses and and I'd like to end
[SPEAKER_01]: with just a couple of reflections from
David Fairchild here and even though he
[SPEAKER_01]: had a very illustrious career in many ways
but in the end it came to down his
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophy at the end of his life was it
was really all about the plants that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all the things he did all the things
he wrote and whatnot but he said that what
[SPEAKER_01]: what was more important to him were the
trees and his at his home at the camp and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the wonders that were associated with
them so he had really you know he was
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly even though he focused a lot on
useful plants on plants being important to
[SPEAKER_01]: enrich US food and US ornament but he just
loved the plants in and of themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: and this was sometimes called his last
testament here that he wrote after his
[SPEAKER_01]: last big expedition right before World War
two to Southeast Asia that what one
[SPEAKER_01]: collects in the shape of opinions data
facts and figures have a rather small
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of being passed on to others and
doing some good because some of that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's superseded as we know but he saw
that you know introducing some seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that may be passed on to someone in
the future and grown by them selected by
[SPEAKER_01]: them just appreciated have a good chance
of doing something good to people long
[SPEAKER_01]: after the shadows fall and his other
aspect of what he hopes that our gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: would do is to be places of wonder and and
to in some way change the world and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that Cornell University is at the
forefront of that kind of activity and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope we can all work together to further
this this vision of making the world a
[SPEAKER_01]: greener and and friendlier place for
humans and plants and and just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: wonders of nature this has been a
production of Cornell University on the
[SPEAKER_00]: web at Cornell edu you
