[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real pleasure to be back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been back to Cornell in a few
years, even though New York City is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really that far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for inviting me here
to talk about the Sustainable Sites
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, which is a project that I've
been involved with now for almost eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a project that I got started with
my involvement with through Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: through working with Dr. Nina Bassick and
the Sustainable Sites team to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable protocols for landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today I'm going to discuss what the
guidelines are all about and go through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the principles behind the
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to discuss the process through
which we've come through in about the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years total to get to where we are
today with the guideline and rating
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to give some examples of
credits that probably relate to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the work you may be doing relating to
vegetation and soil specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the system involves much more
than just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll focus a little bit on that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll also give some site-specific
examples of projects that were involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pilot or testing process for the
system within the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I'll go into what's next,
since there's more to come from this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, I first got involved
with this project as a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lucky enough to get hired on to
be a research assistant specifically in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetation subcommittees with a little
bit of work also in the human health and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being and even the soil
subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Fred Cowitt, and I don't know if
Fred's here today, did a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_00]: this project over the years in the soil
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe he was also a reviewer in
many of the pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a lot of pilot studies for this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who has more questions about
sustainable sites after I've gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially about soil, I would
recommend you talk to Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also Nina Bassick as well,
who unfortunately couldn't be here today
[SPEAKER_00]: because she's at an oak conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sustainable sites is essentially a set
of guidelines and a voluntary rating
[SPEAKER_00]: system for sustainable landscape design,
construction, and maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came out of the growth of green
building, which over the past decade and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half, has had tremendous impact on the
construction design and then facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance professions overall,
not just throughout America, but globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the very first LEED
Platinum building in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really forward thinking at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the troubling things was that
when you looked at landscapes and early
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of LEED, there was a paltry
amount of direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really not a lot of great critical
thinking involving what sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes really meant in relation to the
building side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though we know that buildings
are really important and how we direct our
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and how we construct them and
manage them is really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot more than just that in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more than just buildings,
thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the team on sites came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially the team that first came
together to discuss some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with sustainable development,
which include pesticide use, water usage,
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species problems, combined sewer
overflow issues and how we manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: stormwater, urban heat island effects,
climate change, erosion problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all issues that we didn't think
were being very well managed through the
[SPEAKER_00]: LEED or the US Green Building Council
sustainability criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, the Lady Bird Johnson
Wildflower Center through University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas at Austin, the US Green Building
Council and the American Society of
[SPEAKER_00]: Landscape Architects all came together and
sort of all simultaneously had the same
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that they really needed to develop a
rating system that partnered with LEED or
[SPEAKER_00]: US Green Building Council guidelines and
helped to get those a little more on track
[SPEAKER_00]: with the best scientific knowledge that
they could put together and the best team
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could put together to try to
move forward with a comprehensive set of
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings and a system to help put a better
spin on what sustainable design meant in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, the goals of sites have been
and continue to be to create regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and to foster resiliency,
to ensure future resource supply and to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate climate change, to enhance human
well-being and strengthen community so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's community components to this as
well, to also transform the market through
[SPEAKER_00]: design, development and maintenance
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm involved a lot in capital
projects in my current role and I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past several years how
sustainable development guidelines such as
[SPEAKER_00]: LEED have really transformed the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was once really difficult to
conceive of has over time through the work
[SPEAKER_00]: of these types of rating systems driven it
to become more of an industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the green building side of things
is really well on its way with LEED and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other sustainability systems like
that, the landscape side is still a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit nascent as far as how we're going to
follow up with industry standards and to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principles behind sustainable sites
are based on ecosystem services which are
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits that people obtain from
ecosystems that support our lives but are
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately often considered free and
are not often a part of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole system is underpinned by
bringing forward some of these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't always thought of as formally
as far as cost benefits are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just a few of the
ecosystem services that were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: considered in the development of the
entire rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going forward and trying to
build systems that are a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this could be the result when you,
it's just an example of a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: credentialed pilot project that's been
certified recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see there's quite a
difference between that original LEED
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum building that I showed where
there was like a couple of token trees in
[SPEAKER_00]: the front versus a much more sophisticated
landscape that takes into account a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other ecosystem services that we're
not heretofore really thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the other principles behind
sites include the fact that we believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that almost any type of landscape could be
developed in this manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the testing has been very thoughtfully
positioned so that even if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really small site, you should be able to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you have a really hyper urban
site, you should also be able to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and apply the principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a pristine green site
that's maybe even high quality natural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that you should also be able to
apply these principles there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so also with the idea that ecosystem
services can be derived with any landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timeline of sites goes way back to
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through time we've gone through
research and development, developing
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and guidelines, and then
performance benchmarks which were in draft
[SPEAKER_00]: form in 2008, 2009, which is what I was
involved with early on in helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: create and edit some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they ran a pilot program between 2010
and 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also was involved with a pilot
project in Canada in my formal role at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humber Arboretum in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got pilot program experience
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you a little bit more about
that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also beyond that, they've been
working with all the data that's come
[SPEAKER_00]: through the pilot project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And been refining it since there were
obviously lots of criticisms and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we were able to look at
from the pilot process that were then
[SPEAKER_00]: taken, went back through, and then tried
to clean up the process to make it easier,
[SPEAKER_00]: more accessible, and hopefully less
expensive also to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the latest rendition of
sustainable sites is actually in V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a copy of the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite large, but you can get this
online if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the latest version of the
guidelines and rating systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great is just this past June,
it's been formally announced that the US
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Building Council and GBCI,
which is the credentialing and
[SPEAKER_00]: accreditation body for LEED, is formally
taking this system on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now officially part of the LEED
suite of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first time ever that the
US Green Building Council has adopted a
[SPEAKER_00]: program that they didn't specifically
develop themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite an achievement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the system's been, I guess,
designed to mesh from the very get-go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's taken quite a lot of work to get
that to come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finally, you can have a site that's
accredited officially and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: credentialed through GBCI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the three reports that have been
released to date, this was the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can look this up and see how
everything was based initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also been some great support
through the US government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an example of the way that this
particular system is influencing not just
[SPEAKER_00]: industry standards, but also influencing
government policy is that the US
[SPEAKER_00]: government's been adopting the guidelines
also for their own sites, since the
[SPEAKER_00]: government owns quite a lot of acreage
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be very influential just to have
the government agree that these are their
[SPEAKER_00]: de facto guidelines that they're going to
use going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so beyond that, I'll explain the sites
program goals for the pilot program,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been very interesting to see
a lot of different kinds of sites go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the pilot process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to derive a lot of great
information to refine the process through
[SPEAKER_00]: the pilot programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really were looking to gain feedback
and revise the credits from the get-go,
[SPEAKER_00]: since we knew that this is quite a complex
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been always knowing that it's
not going to be really ever finished for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pilot program started in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the kinds of projects that
project types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a good diversity deliberately
in the pilot project selection process
[SPEAKER_00]: between types of spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ranges between open space and
institutional, commercial, residential,
[SPEAKER_00]: government, project sizes, also tried to
have a diversity of really small sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even very large sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the sites that were in the
pilot project were well over 500 acres,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also a different mix of existing
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we define, sorry, I'm going to
go back here, Grayfield, Greenfield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Brownfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grayfield is a previously developed site,
but not one that is completely toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenfield is something that's not really
been that affected by development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a natural area might be considered a
greenfield, but a park, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: original usage, could be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Brownfields, which are
seriously toxic sites, which actually need
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of remediation, even extra
thought and process to be able to make use
[SPEAKER_00]: of them and to get them to be regenerative
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 47 sites to date that were
certified by the pilot program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pilot project process is now
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were originally, I think,
maybe close to 200 sites that applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were the sites that,
across the country, actually finished the
[SPEAKER_00]: process and actually got certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that I was involved with a
pilot project in Canada, and we did not
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is as much telling what sites
did not achieve certification as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so though I was sad that we didn't
achieve certification, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we had, and one thing that
I deliberately went into with my eyes wide
[SPEAKER_00]: open, is that I was trying to certify a
site that had been completed primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: over five years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the message that I got and that went
back to the sites team was that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: not really try to be getting certified for
this particular sustainable sites
[SPEAKER_00]: certification process unless you've got a
very new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a new project coming online,
and you're able to start the process for
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable sites early in the concept
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying to do it on the back end,
and I really couldn't get all the data
[SPEAKER_00]: together in order to do that from what the
site looked like prior to the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were words of caution that I had
to bring back to the sites team,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they took that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now they know that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one example of how you
might fail if you're doing a pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's OK, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went pretty far down the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, we got 47 sites
certified and a very good mix of different
[SPEAKER_00]: project types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was absolutely deliberate,
and so got great data from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was really an early stage
criticism of the Sustainable Sites
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative was whether or not you could do
it for a really, really small site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did have some sites that were able
to prove that, yes, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, you could actually apply
these principles to a backyard landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an urban postage stamp landscape,
and still do that if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a little bit easier,
perhaps, if you have a larger scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this one of the outside manned
libraries?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, and I was going to talk about that
at the end as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there is a pilot project site here
that did achieve certification,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is the Entry Gardens to Man
Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, and I have some good stats on
that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting also to look at what pilot
projects and how they were able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and what level of certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time of the pilot projects,
we had a star system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more stars you got, the higher the
level of certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four stars would be equivalent to
platinum, and one star would be equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: to, I guess, is it bronze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's bronze, silver, gold,
and platinum, I think, for LEED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were the approximate
equivalencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see here that the vast
majority of the projects went for the
[SPEAKER_00]: one-star certification, which is a little
bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do the hardest, obviously, is the four
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that was the Phipps
Conservatory in Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anybody who's gone to the Phipps
Conservatory can check out that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are tremendous in their leadership in
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, they were able to get
certified triple certification in LEED
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum for their building, living
building challenge certification,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is all or nothing, and then the
highest level of certification for
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are really an exemplary project to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got the site's version 2
rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have the reference guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within the new rating system,
there is a division of different
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines and credits that basically
following the general design process,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're going through a new
project, if you've got your landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: architect, you're designed team,
your engineers in place, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: contractors hired, it takes it from
pre-designed site and concept through to
[SPEAKER_00]: planning different aspects from water
management, soil vegetation, your
[SPEAKER_00]: materials usage, your reuse of materials
hopefully as well, then also guides you
[SPEAKER_00]: through human health and well-being and
how to plan for your community or just
[SPEAKER_00]: general usage of the site to optimal
effect, then going into construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then operations and maintenance
guidelines since we all know that a
[SPEAKER_00]: project doesn't end when the construction
is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to operate and keep our sites
working functionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an extra challenge even
beyond what was normally taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: account with the buildings because all of
this entails stewarding functional living
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a building can theoretically be a
little bit more stagnant than a landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: can, but a landscape is always going to be
changing and it's always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully be growing in some way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So managing that over time is actually
much more challenging, I would argue,
[SPEAKER_00]: than opening a building and maintaining a
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I manage facilities and
horticulture in my current job,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know too that buildings break down
and they're difficult to do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to say that it's not hard
for both things, but I think managing
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes and thinking about this
long-term is even much more difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beyond that, there's also credits
and guidelines for how to go forth with
[SPEAKER_00]: extra work that you can do for education
and monitoring the performance over time
[SPEAKER_00]: of these landscapes and then even extra
innovation and exemplary performance
[SPEAKER_00]: credits since these projects have been
tremendous in coming back to us with all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of really innovative things that we
had never thought of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always looking to steward that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a scorecard that looks kind of
similar to what you might find if you run
[SPEAKER_00]: through a lead project and this is what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at this online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of small print, but you get the
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of do your little checklist
ahead of time and then through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how you're scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also interesting to look at the
kinds of professionals who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting to us that they're most
interested in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously you can see that
landscape architects have been the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority interest in this project and
that's reflective obviously of the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're the ones who are really
involved with the design and construction
[SPEAKER_00]: process in a lot of these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of other professions
that this should be affecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully stewarding new professional
interest in sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know I'm a horticulturist by
training and I found working through this
[SPEAKER_00]: process to be invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because of it, I'm hopefully a
better partner in the construction process
[SPEAKER_00]: when I get involved with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a lot to be learned
for a whole slew of different professions
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system is based on a 200 point
scale at this point and it recognizes
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of attainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually 18 prerequisites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are not just credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that you absolutely must
do in order to be a part of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll explain a few of those going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond the 18 prerequisites,
there's also many points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the points are awarded
for different credits based on level of
[SPEAKER_00]: attainment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's now four levels of
attainment that will approximate now the
[SPEAKER_00]: LEED system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going more into the platinum
and the gold certification I believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to make it mesh better with the LEED
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eligible projects could be new
construction, but maybe major renovations
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really a system designed for
brand new projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, it's really difficult
to try to do it after the fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't recommend it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no maximum size, but there is a
minimum of 2,000 square feet in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're open to all projects types.
[SPEAKER_00]: With sites, with buildings, or without.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the other interesting
comparison to LEED early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't have a building on your
site, you couldn't get LEED certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot more than just
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt it was important that you
didn't have to hang your hat on a building
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be considered a sustainable
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is also open globally as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some initial pilot projects
that applied to be a part of the title
[SPEAKER_00]: testing process, including my own,
which was in Canada, and I think a few in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if any of those actually
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a few extra challenges
that comes from trying to work on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project from outside the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something I know they're going
to be working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Green Building Council has the
capacity to bring it forward into a global
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principles behind the process
involve an examination of your waste
[SPEAKER_00]: hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately, we try to prevent
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can't do that, we reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we can't do that, we just reuse
and then recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ultimate worst thing that we
can do is really to have things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: disposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to stay to the top of the waste
hierarchy with the system credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also trying to instill a
paradigm shift from not just conservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show some examples of projects
that went beyond just conserving
[SPEAKER_00]: high-value landscapes, but also took
pretty dysfunctional landscapes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: made them into regenerative ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graphic shows further the
difference between conservation and then
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing it over to regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a well-performing
landscape, you could, in theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: conserve what you have and just get really
good tree protection or protect that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting a fence around it is just an
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to come out,
OK, just conservation is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to steward that in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could manage a little bit better
what you've got if you're not doing such a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restoration, if you cut your tree down,
maybe you can try to restore the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: and then get it back up to a functional
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there's lots of sites
that we're working with that are toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly any life in them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the existing conditions are
deplorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sites are really encouraged to take on
those kinds of challenges in the process
[SPEAKER_00]: and to develop a project that's going to
create future site conditions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: much, much better and have regenerative
and functional landscapes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said I was going to focus a little
bit on soil and vegetation credits,
[SPEAKER_00]: since I think that probably best applies
to most of this group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the credits you can see
listed here pertain to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four at the top that are actually
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I mentioned before,
the prerequisites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here that you have no
recourse but to create and communicate a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil management plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must see that in order for you to be
considered part of the system for
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to agree to control and manage
your invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to use appropriate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting how we've defined
all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've debated a lot over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody on the team felt that it was
imperative that we at least start with
[SPEAKER_00]: that as a baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the rest of the credits are
actually optional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's different levels of points
that you can get depending on how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some examples include controlling and
managing invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we just thought this was
not even an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here, I think this is
kudzu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just don't even want to talk about
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just control and manage and deal with
invasive species if you're developing a
[SPEAKER_00]: new site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't add new invasive species into
your projects either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also something that's very
important and that gets vetted through the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd probably be preaching to the
choir to even go further into why that's
[SPEAKER_00]: as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'll just move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can talk to me afterwards if you
want to discuss that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using appropriate plants, this was
something that went over a lot of debates
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know Nina was involved a lot in this
discussion too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to steward not native plants
necessarily, but just appropriate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as they're not invasive and
they're appropriate for the site,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could theoretically get sustainable
sites accreditation without having any
[SPEAKER_00]: native plants on your site, if you so
suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely some credits that
encourage native plants and responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: use of native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not always the most appropriate
to be only using native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just making sure that they're
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they're legally sourced as well,
since our industry sometimes has some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with illegal sourcing of plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making sure that the nurseries are
also in line with that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using appropriate plants, if you're going
for this kind of credit, you might just
[SPEAKER_00]: show a planting plan similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really all that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of one of the
submissions for a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hopefully isn't going to be too
difficult to get this credit and just do
[SPEAKER_00]: the check off list and make sure you're
not doing invasive species and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there's credits and prerequisites to
conserve healthy resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of those include mapping and
making sure that you're on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: creation and management of vegetation and
soil protection zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always an uphill battle,
it seems, when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: construction to make sure that you're
protecting trees or soil quality that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got on your site that are existing
that are functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a prerequisite that designates
and communicates your vegetation and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: protection zones at the get go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully this should be best
management practice or proper practice for
[SPEAKER_00]: any construction project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anybody who's ever been involved with
a project knows that that's not always the
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping on track with that,
it can be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know we still struggle with this at
Broken Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I'm always trying
to make sure that the specifications we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the management of the projects
that we're on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be an example of
communicating where your vegetation and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil protection zones are going to be on a
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would say, oh, I've got prime farmland
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to run that all over with
heavy equipment and destroy the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: quality there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got existing native plant
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not destroy those by driving
bulldozers all over it or parking our
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, special status vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also some credits in the
system, not just for high quality native
[SPEAKER_00]: plant communities or farmland soils,
but for, I guess, heritage value
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes trees might not be native,
but they might have some sort of other
[SPEAKER_00]: value that is important for you to
preserve in the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try not to destroy all that during the
process is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an interesting credit that I
wanted to mention called optimized
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has been debated quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially here, it's intended to
help you support the water nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric gas and climate regulation
systems on site by maintaining a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological integrity for that site that's
comparable to what is in your native plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while that might sound a little
complicated, all it comes down to is
[SPEAKER_00]: really determining what the terrestrial
biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a desert community,
don't try to plant a landscape that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be approximate to what you would
have in the Northeast, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need so many more water and
nutrient inputs that it's not a very
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, you might not want to try to
create a desert landscape and not expect a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of success with that if you're trying
to do that in a really rainy area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be realistic and look at what's
around you and look at the resources that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be coming into your site naturally
with precipitation, climate, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just look at that and be realistic
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, then what you're doing there
is optimizing your biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly, there's another credit for
reducing urban heat island effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that and how do we
calculate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we look at the area of non-roof
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put in these numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your non-roof measures,
your area of high-reflectant roofs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the credit, it also takes into
account vegetated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can vegetate your roof and help to
mitigate a little bit of urban heat island
[SPEAKER_00]: effect with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also just change the
reflectivity of the surfaces of your site
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's options with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're looking to use vegetation to
minimize building energy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a really interesting credit
that I worked a lot on where we developed
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations to try to prove whether your
vegetation on your roof or even around the
[SPEAKER_00]: building was able to provide reduced
energy benefits to the building itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by that, if you have a green roof,
you're likely going to reduce your air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning costs quite significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a calculator to help you with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if you plant certain shade
trees at a very specific distance to your
[SPEAKER_00]: building, then you can also derive benefit
from shading around and outside your
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are going to reduce the energy costs
for that building themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heating and the cooling aspects of
this are very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what climate zone you
are, you might be going more towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioning reduction through
shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in a northern community,
can you derive benefit from strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings that are going to reduce your
heating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to really think about that
and design that as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a credit which developed and
is obviously very important, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the area that you're living in and the
landscape that you're developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: to strategically plant to reduce the risk
of catastrophic wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's really important at
West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we worked with forest service
guidelines from the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was already quite a lot of data
on strategically planting or not planting
[SPEAKER_00]: things in some cases close to or around
your sites in order to reduce the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: complete devastation by wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, controlling and retaining your
construction pollutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something similarly to maintaining
your vegetation and soil protection zones
[SPEAKER_00]: during the construction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prerequisite as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have no choice but to do
this, thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes during your construction
process, construction pollutants or other
[SPEAKER_00]: pollutants can create a lot of havoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so erosion is also a big part of this
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to prove that you're not
creating a worse situation through your
[SPEAKER_00]: construction process through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater management as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also looking to steward different
kinds of management of precipitation on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sites and improving your runoff volume
and water quality in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of sites have really taken
this to heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pilot projects at least and have
gone on to do a lot of great water
[SPEAKER_00]: management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously these are rain gardens and
bioswales and a parking lot to control
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to go into some actual
pilot project examples and show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's come to fruition over the last
couple of years through the testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: refinement of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Hunts Point Landing,
which is in the Bronx in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even further to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here it's a highly degraded
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I guess you've got a couple
people who are able to fish there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, this is not a very high
quality site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, they were able to get a much
better design implemented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has anybody ever been to this site?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well anyway, you can see here that they've
installed a whole wonderful landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a major public amenity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still, I think, allow the fishing to
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they saw that as a positive on the site
already that people were using it as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a much nicer area now
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, a lot of sites in the
Bronx, as you know, are highly degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: and would be considered brownfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this was also in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extra points are awarded for those who
choose to take on a brownfield site and to
[SPEAKER_00]: remediate it and to create a beautiful
landscape on those sites, because those
[SPEAKER_00]: can be particularly challenging and
expensive to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the points of breakdown of
what this particular pilot project was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, because it was a
brownfield, they got the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: points, 21 points for their site
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by selecting the brownfield,
they were off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also got four out of four points
for pre-design assessment and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pretty good water stewardship points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil and vegetation, about 50% there,
but still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material selection, they didn't get
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what went on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe that just wasn't the priority of
the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting to see how you could
still achieve certification without
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily having to go into all of the
credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human health and well-being, because they
kept this to be a good public amenity and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was still a public site.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to prove value there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction process, obviously,
was pretty well managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still monitoring it and were
able to also get some innovation points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now, here's how it looks today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another great example is Washington
Canal Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a highly degraded site in
the middle of Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a bus depot, as you can see
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take the above view,
you can see that it was obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by dense, not planting,
dense buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this site was going to likely be
a challenge to develop as a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they came up with some fantastic
solutions to manage this site from here on
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all rainwater and stormwater
harvested water supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a graphic that might be a
little far away for you to see in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, they're collecting
rainwater from all the buildings around
[SPEAKER_00]: this courtyard area and directing the
stormwater underground and cleaning the
[SPEAKER_00]: water so that it's using this water in all
different ways on the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some examples of their rain
gardens and then their collection
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms here, which are relatively
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they go underground and
recirculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they actually even have,
so essentially, rainwater harvested,
[SPEAKER_00]: open, publicly accessible fountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, if anybody works in regulations at
all, this is really difficult to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for many, many years, there's been
a big fear of not having traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: treated potable water in all your water
features that are publicly accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fight, they fought the good
fight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were able to prove that they
could take stormwater and take rainwater
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean it to the point where they could
have it be of a high enough quality to
[SPEAKER_00]: have children playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a fabulous project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for that reason, but that is one
amazing thing that they were able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, luckily, they were probably
able to connect with the US Botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden, which is a site close by that was
a major developer of this entire system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably get them on board to help get
the decision makers to make sure that this
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I can't forget to mention the
Cornell University's Mann Library
[SPEAKER_00]: entrance, which is a pilot project that
was completed in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was planted, I know, through Nina's
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can't remember the name of the
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Urban Eden?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was planted through and planned
through the Urban Eden class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were able to achieve a one
star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one star is absolutely better than no
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fantastic that they were able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also a testing case for a
really small site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This site is not that large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really essentially the planting areas
right in front of the landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: so not the whole quad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also been doing tremendous
work, because they are testing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're feeding the data back on some
of the soil remediation work that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: in this particular area back into the
site's data collection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used a scoop and dump technique to
remediate the soil, which had been heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was basically, I think, used in part
as a parking lot for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: construction practices, or maybe a staging
area in some respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that can really negatively
impact the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a control as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an area of comparative,
I guess, soil quality from the time when
[SPEAKER_00]: they started that they're leaving as a
control, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're comparing and contrasting
how the soil quality is improving over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they're using the healthy
Cornell Healthy Soils test protocols for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody familiar with that here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so primarily, this particular pilot
project was a lot about soil quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting and what results you can get over
time from making adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned before that there's 200
points total for certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're moving more into the sites
certified, so baseline, or silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: gold, and platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything over 135 points is considered
platinum level or above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Green Building Council now taking
on the certification fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still actually a little bit
in development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the announcement of the
certification process moving into Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Building Council status is still pretty
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still coming together and
finalizing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in registering a
site as a sustainable site, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably contact the sustainable sites
people first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually get registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get on your way with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can always use the
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guidelines, you don't have to register
and certify as a project to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of have to have the book or
download it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always encourage anybody to use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go through full
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even any small component of this has got a
lot of great material in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how it all fits together, long term,
is that GBCI does the credentialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're actually a separate
nonprofit from the US Green Building
[SPEAKER_00]: Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they set this up deliberately so that
the US Green Building Council's lead
[SPEAKER_00]: system wasn't getting vetted and certified
by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they thought in order to avoid the
conflict, they have a separate body,
[SPEAKER_00]: the GBCI group, that does the actual
certifications of the projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the US Green Building Council is the
one responsible for professional
[SPEAKER_00]: development, education, and so stewardship
of the overall system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really the way it's going to
work, but in partnership with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable sites team that works out of
Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's meshing together now and is well
on its way to full accreditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's likely to come in a year or two is
professional credentialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anybody here who is certified
as a lead professional?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's generally more landscape
architecture credential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be professionally certified
and credentialed to be a lead
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's various levels of lead
professional credentialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thought is that you could also be
certified as a professional site on
[SPEAKER_00]: professional sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure exactly what they're
going to call that, but that's likely
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So worth mentioning also is Landscape for
Life, which is a somewhat lighter version
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Sustainable Sites Initiative that's
been stewarded through the US Botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really an educational program
that helps homeowners and folks who aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really in the landscape profession better
understand sustainable sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of heavy data and
information and work in the Sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: Sites Reference Guide that is far beyond
what your average homeowner or somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's not going to delve that deeply into
it really wants to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sustainable sites is for professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really for anybody, including
general decision makers who don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know all the nitty gritty details
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gives a lot of the underlying
principles that are also in sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, but takes them to a pretty basic
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a whole education program
that US Botanic Garden works through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get free online training or
even in-course training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little bit of a train the
trainer component as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also a great project for folks
who are in community horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: community horticulture stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go on their website and
download a lot of great materials and
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with them if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I will thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to open up for any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, what do you do with
existing sites that you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fully renovate or completely gut and redo,
and how to work on those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a very good thing to
think about on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my prediction is that similar to the
way the LEED system has developed over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, LEED started with new construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it moved into other types of systems
that go far beyond new construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: including existing buildings, operations,
and maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LEED for neighborhoods, which is at a
whole different scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: For urban planning, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I predict that sites could go in that
direction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've definitely talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But existing site operations and
maintenance is definitely a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably that will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to get through that
professional credentialing first,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make sure that the new project
system is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really good question,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one thing that we hope through
the development of sites to do is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up, and to not just say,
all right, see you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could let it all go to pot,
in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would still have your site
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we really don't want
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cost to come back and keep
checking on sites over time is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quite significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should mention that there's actually
a flat rate pretty much right now to be
[SPEAKER_00]: registered and to be going through the
certification process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of the size of your site at
this point, it ranges between about $2,500
[SPEAKER_00]: to like $9,000, depending on how you're
going to go through certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of like a flat fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to be able to afford
through the management of the system to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sending people back, there may have to be
like an add on after the fact so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of keep your certification over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with the landscape side of it,
it really makes sense to do that long term
[SPEAKER_00]: and to try to just keep checking up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead system, from what I understand,
doesn't really have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get your lead platinum
certification, there isn't at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe they're changing this,
a way to go back and ensure that that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular building that's been certified
for new construction is operating
[SPEAKER_00]: optimally or still operating with all the
principles in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I think with all of these
semi-competitive systems, the competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: nature in people is one hopeful
motivation, even though that can sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: come out as a negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to compete to be the most
sustainable in their landscape design,
[SPEAKER_00]: construction, and maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's definitely one factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it or not, we tend to have that as
one motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, anybody who's gone through the pilot
process and looked deeply at the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really finds that they learn a lot
through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's one motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wanting to get on track for
sustainability long term is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is really important to keep in
mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm coming from a public garden
standpoint, and a lot of public gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: have figured out that they just need to do
this no matter what, that we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of great leadership
in the public garden world already in
[SPEAKER_00]: working with sustainable sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, Phipps Conservatory,
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanic Garden, Ladybird Johnson
Wildflower Center, a lot of public gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: have taken this on and felt that they just
have to do this to maintain the brand that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have, because it's expected that we
be really top notch, not only in our
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes, in general, and how beautiful
they look, but also in all the underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability in the design and
management of those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like easy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether your typical privately managed
landscape or privately owned or industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape wants to go to this,
I think it may be something about brand
[SPEAKER_00]: management that they want to push forward
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's, I think, what stewarded
a lot of it with early stage and high
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking lead projects as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the interesting thing is some of
these sections, you actually can't ever
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of them, because it's almost like
an either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either you're doing, if you don't have
certain site conditions, you just can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not that you should be
penalized for not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the challenge with the
scoring system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might always feel that if you don't
get everything, that you're not doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, say, you don't have a natural
area, you can't get a credit for
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting natural areas, because you just
don't have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you don't have a wetland on site
already, you can't get a credit for
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting an existing wetland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's several credits like that that
are really optional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not designed that you can get
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's partially the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not really a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the town just east of here,
we have zoning that incentivizes lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see this added to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem that we've run into is that
because the assignment of points is
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat qualitative, we have proposals
that are offering very different ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: service levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they both qualify for getting the
incentive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a constant problem,
trying to make sure the rating system
[SPEAKER_01]: matches the benefit that they're actually
bringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's very big and deep and wide
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other way to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to think about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to steward a holistic system
and to think about all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and all the different ways that
we could be quantifying and calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: properly is really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fun, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, all right, I'm going to hurt my
brain a lot doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's for the best, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
