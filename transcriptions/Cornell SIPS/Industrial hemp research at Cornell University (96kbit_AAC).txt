[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp research was authorized in
the 2014 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, as the land grant university in
New York State, picked up very quickly to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin a pilot program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started our hemp research in the middle
of the 2016 growing season, but really it
[SPEAKER_00]: took off in the 2017 growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also asked by New York State Ag and
Markets and the governor's office to lead
[SPEAKER_00]: an initiative to plant 1,700 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: That support from the governor's office
and the legislature and Ag and Markets has
[SPEAKER_00]: really put New York at the forefront of
hemp research in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research in particular is to evaluate
existing hemp cultivars for their
[SPEAKER_00]: suitability in New York conditions,
to be able to advise farmers as to the
[SPEAKER_00]: best cultivars for them to grow as they
get started in the hemp industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also we're initiating a long-term hemp
breeding program to develop cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are adapted for New York conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has assembled a strong
multidisciplinary team of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to cover all of the
bases of hemp research in the
[SPEAKER_00]: multidisciplinary expertise that we have
in the School of Integrated Plant Science
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp industry overall has grown by
leaps and bounds across the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is one of the leaders in hemp
research in the country.
