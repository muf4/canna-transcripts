[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for coming and I hope that
when you leave after this seminar you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: know everything you wanted to know about
NUA and you'll be charged to build models
[SPEAKER_04]: and tools for growers and communities,
etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: that use weather to tell them what they
should be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is NUA?
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA is a crowd-sourced network.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm starting my timer so I don't keep
you guys too awfully long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that terrible?
[SPEAKER_04]: I started a stopwatch instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm canceling that and I'm going to
use the ancient technology that's hanging
[SPEAKER_04]: on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's not a solar, you know,
one of those things we need to be out in
[SPEAKER_04]: the sun so I can see where the shade was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So NUA is a crowd-sourced network.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weather station owners are sharing their
data through the network and providing us
[SPEAKER_04]: with feedback and guidance on how we can
improve the network and how we can grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weather data currently is collected
every 15 minutes and it is tabulated in
[SPEAKER_04]: hourly and daily summaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're collecting precipitation,
temperature, relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_04]: leak wetness, solar radiation,
wind speed, and wind direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the weather stations in the network
have now optional soil temperature and
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not going to have a good
accumulation of degree days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really important not to have
missing data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically all of this data is used to
build decision support tools for IPM and
[SPEAKER_04]: crop production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I'll be talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit more boring history stuff for
you before we get into the meat of the
[SPEAKER_04]: talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA was created in 1996 by Kurt Petzl,
who at the time was the vegetable IPM
[SPEAKER_04]: coordinator with the New York State IPM
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had gotten, believe it or not,
a telecommunications grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we set up phone lines and modems all
across New York to gather weather data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a phone?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So initially it was an association with
membership levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today it's open access and we have land
grant and grower member support.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started out with camel instruments and
sensor instruments, sensotronics,
[SPEAKER_04]: box sensor, those became obsolete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we use primarily brainwise
incorporated weather stations,
[SPEAKER_04]: although we can ingest data from onset
instruments, airports, and states.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already talked about the manual
download.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to go out with the computer,
the laptop computer and download.
[SPEAKER_04]: We faxed the data out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Messages were created and posted on
Kodafones and the growers could call those
[SPEAKER_04]: phones and get that message as to what the
prediction was for the particular day or
[SPEAKER_04]: week or what have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we have 428 weather station
locations in 23 states that are ingested
[SPEAKER_04]: into NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 10 member states plus individual
members in five other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave a seminar on NUA a month ago and
there were 415 weather stations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 13 more just in the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the NUA homepage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't expect you to be able to read
this, but I just wanted to point out some
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the pointer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, eyesight.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pointer is not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use the cursor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is the website for NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: This blue menu up here follows you
throughout the website, giving you access
[SPEAKER_04]: to weather data, test forecast,
crop management info, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And up here, I kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little national weather service
query box.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can enter your city state here,
press go and find out what the weather
[SPEAKER_04]: forecast is from the National Weather
Service.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, given where we are with the
internet, the map saves your location.
[SPEAKER_04]: It knows where you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that can be really creepy for some of
us who are old school, but it's exciting
[SPEAKER_04]: for those of you who like using the web
and having it seamlessly remember where
[SPEAKER_04]: you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is not how I advance the slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how I advance the slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the NUA station pages look like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the Ashwood weather station
page.
[SPEAKER_04]: It provides quick links to test forecasts
here, some weather products here,
[SPEAKER_04]: quick links.
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually has been upgraded.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of these screenshots,
if you go now, they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly the same because as with any web
technology, we're changing it all the time
[SPEAKER_04]: and updating it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can access location-specific data
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This happens to be a weather station that
belongs to an apple grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And typically, the apple growers will
link, you know, they'll bookmark this page
[SPEAKER_04]: so that they can get to the models easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the NUA map.
[SPEAKER_04]: The states that are colored purple are
member states.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pay an annual fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those that are orange have just
individual growers that are plugged into
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA that are paying a smaller fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the larger Google map shows the
icons that are the NUA stations and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the National Weather Service airport
locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does NUA benefit the programs of
plant ecology and plant microbiology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, certainly plant disease forecast
models can be developed into tools to
[SPEAKER_04]: inform management decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: IPM is all about reducing the pesticide
footprint in crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see as I get through this talk
how much of an impact this system has on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weather data can be used to validate and
implement plant disease epidemiology
[SPEAKER_04]: models or potentially some research that
you're doing on a plant disease epidemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, data in NUA can be used for
pathosystem research and development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're just doing some research out
in the field and there's a weather station
[SPEAKER_04]: close by, you can correlate some of those
weather events to disease development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here today and I'm giving...
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm giving this talk for the third
time, no, for the fourth time I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: say I'm giving this talk to stimulate
thinking about developing and utilizing
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA to benefit agriculture and communities
and to raise awareness of what NUA has to
[SPEAKER_04]: offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you have the dubious distinction,
Madeline, of having seen my seminar that I
[SPEAKER_04]: gave for soil and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave a seminar for entomology last month
and next month should you choose to see
[SPEAKER_04]: what we have to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: For horticulture, I'll be giving this talk
in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now I have a plethora of devices up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're going to go through some of
these predictive tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fall into basically three categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crop management tools, weather products,
and pest forecast tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these tools are in real time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're query based, decision support.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, some of them have built in
biofixes, so biofix could be first trap
[SPEAKER_04]: catch date of codling moth or codling moth
management in an apple orchard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be emergence date for potatoes or
understanding when to spray for late
[SPEAKER_04]: blight or early blight to know when that
crop is emerging.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have a built in biofix
for that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all have an interactive user
interface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the crop management tools, I'm not
going to dwell on here, but primarily they
[SPEAKER_04]: are, this is the drop down list on NUA for
these and again this changes depending on
[SPEAKER_04]: what we've got to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But primarily crop load management,
irrigation, and freeze risk are the three
[SPEAKER_04]: key areas that people are interested in
utilizing weather data for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weather products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, again this is the drop down
list from the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have all these degree days for these
base temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are based on the models that we
currently have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're already calculating the base
temperature, we just basically use that
[SPEAKER_04]: and calculate that and show the tabulated
degree days for that base temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're tabulated starting from four
different dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: January 1, obvious calendar date.
[SPEAKER_04]: March 1, apple growers like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1, and May 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think April 1, grape growers like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have hourly data tables,
daily summary tables, and a degree day
[SPEAKER_04]: calculator, yay, which we just resurrected
this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to share this with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited about getting this back
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: It went offline when we migrated to a new
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically you can select the degree day
type, accumulation start date,
[SPEAKER_04]: end date, hit report.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously you need to select the state and
the weather station location.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the results show up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This graph is initially hidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can hit a button and it pops open.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you scroll along, there's a little
pop up box that tells you essentially the
[SPEAKER_04]: point at which you're looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a forecast of five days, past two
days, and the current.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the degree day accumulation
each day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it got cold in September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it warm this week?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go climate warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry, nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there obviously is a seasonal
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this I'm going to show you because this
is what growers can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the hourly and daily data
summaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this basically is showing what we're
now calling the Valentine's Day massacre.
[SPEAKER_04]: So last winter was really mild,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just really bizarrely mild.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then what happened was around
Valentine's Day, the temperature
[SPEAKER_04]: plummeted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see it got as low as minus 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is the daily data summary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see here's the 14th and the
15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why the sweet cherry crop was
pretty much toast in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: There weren't any peaches to speak of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apricots were toast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those of you who are fans of nectarines
and peaches like I am, it was a real
[SPEAKER_04]: bummer because we really didn't have many
of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm going to talk about the things
that are near and dear to our hearts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the best forecast tools for
plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found out yesterday that we have two
more plant disease tools than I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: because, well, I'll get into that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used to say 14, but I got to put 16
on the slide yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to walk through the apple
scab model.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fruit person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of what I know about is fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, what you're going to do as
I mentioned with the degree day
[SPEAKER_04]: calculator, you're going to select a
disease on the apple disease models,
[SPEAKER_04]: a state.
[SPEAKER_04]: This screenshot happens to be before we
put the state drop down in this tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd select a weather station.
[SPEAKER_04]: This happened to be in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was giving a talk in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the day of interest, April 29.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you hit calculate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially this map tab is showing and it
has a Google map.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you did calculate, you get the
little dots of wheels going and the
[SPEAKER_04]: results show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the top, you can see that there's a
green tip date.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are estimating this green tip date and
its Macintosh green tip date from over 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years of historical observations at the
New York State Agricultural Experiment
[SPEAKER_04]: Station at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been looking at apple phenology
and insect data for years and years up
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also had weather data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can estimate that green tip date.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can override it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can enter your 50% green tip of
Macintosh date here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the model will recalculate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So initially at the top there,
the ASCA score maturity summary.
[SPEAKER_04]: ASCA scores over winter in the leaf litter
in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they mature in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need at least 11 to 12% mature acai
for score ejection to be likely to occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this from a lot of work that's
been done on apple scab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you can see the apple scab ASCA
score maturity model is showing what the
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulation is for this time frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, two past dates, a current date and
the five day forecast here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like, oh yeah, we're in the
apple scab season here, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can click on this and it'll show you
the ASCA score maturity chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the chart for ASCA score
maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, if it was April 1, it wouldn't
show all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just show a portion of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, April 1 was the green tip date.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go back so that I can not confuse
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the date of interest was April 29.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is the ASCA score maturity
chart for that date.
[SPEAKER_04]: And down here, this shows the temperature
in blue, the precip in green, and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: forecast data is in a different color,
brown, yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Below the ASCA score maturity chart are
the apple scab infection events.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are calculated based on rainfall and
temperature during that rain or leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: wetting event.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, the chart's going to be
green or red depending on whether there is
[SPEAKER_04]: an event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was accessing this historically and
that's why the days to symptoms haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: calculated here because the forecast
details at that point in time weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: being saved and they couldn't populate
this chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: But below, the management information is
below here and it's included here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can click here for a pesticide
selection tool that is housed on another
[SPEAKER_04]: website.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the growing season progresses,
this will change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the model goes dormant from October 1
to March 1.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this says a combined event up here,
you can click down here at the apple scab
[SPEAKER_04]: infection events and you'll get the
details of what went into deciding to
[SPEAKER_04]: combine two wetting events into a single
wetting event to determine infection risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is basically the leaf wetness
events log.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2015 was a really wet year, obviously in
Minnesota as well as here in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next I'm going to share the fire blight
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire blight risk, I think probably this
model and the apple scab model are the two
[SPEAKER_04]: top used models by apple growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire blight is a bacterial disease that
will kill trees outright.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kills limbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It enters the blossoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: The model is modeling blossom blight as
opposed to shoot blight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to know when the first blossom
open date is and again, historically
[SPEAKER_04]: calculated or you can enter it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can say what the blight
history is in your orchard here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This model is based on the cougar blight
model from Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hit calculate, these are the
results that you'll get.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see for the dates I chose,
there was low risk in the past,
[SPEAKER_04]: but currently there's high risk going into
the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it's getting cooler again and the
risk drops off.
[SPEAKER_04]: This information defines the risk levels
and then there's more to this model below.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially what you can do is you can
enter the date that you applied
[SPEAKER_04]: streptomycin, which is an antibiotic
registered for use against fire blight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you enter that date, you will
recalculate the risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I applied strep on May 11,
you can see the risk has dropped now to
[SPEAKER_04]: much lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rest of these, I'm just going to
give you some screen shots of the rest of
[SPEAKER_04]: these models that we have on NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a great disease infection events
model for phomopsis, powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_04]: black rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a downy mildew simulation
model built by years of research by Roger
[SPEAKER_04]: Pearson, Bob Seaman, David Bimori up in
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called DMCAST.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a screen shot of that,
but there's that model as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see in the past there really
was no risk, but it looks like in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future forecast, things could get dicey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's disease management
information down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the page obviously is longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tomato disease forecast, which was
just recently revised by Abby Sina,
[SPEAKER_04]: who's the vegetable IPM coordinator,
is shown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a screen shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you can see you've entered the
information on this side, as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: before, get report, and then this is the
report that shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where I got the two additional
diseases because I didn't realize TomCast
[SPEAKER_04]: was also being used to predict septoria
blight and anthracnose on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this shows the results for TomCast as
well as late blight simcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a key giving information
about what these things mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a late blight app that Bill
Fry's program developed called BlightPro
[SPEAKER_04]: DSS.
[SPEAKER_04]: DSS stands for Decision Support System.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a link to that on NUA so that
if you wanted to download that app,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The potato disease forecast, very similar,
except the early blight model is
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's calculating P days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the P day key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here's the late blight past
severity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Onion disease model was recently revised.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were all separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're all on one page.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got the botrytis leaf blight
model, downy mildew, and purple blotch
[SPEAKER_04]: here, as well as the keys that tell you
what all of this means.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is NUA and how is it growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to talk about sort of the
inner rootings of NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started partnering with the North East
Regional Climate Center in probably 2007,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they now house our climate database.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help us with model programming into
the PI design tools that I just gave you
[SPEAKER_04]: some snapshots of.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help us with data quality control,
provide meteorological expertise and
[SPEAKER_04]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the nice thing is that they're
interested in agricultural applications
[SPEAKER_04]: for climate data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they helped us develop automated
reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that if a weather station isn't
reporting, an automated message goes to
[SPEAKER_04]: that owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they know then that their weather
station isn't reporting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has been really well received.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it would be kind of ticked off,
but quite the opposite, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an example of one of the tools
that the North East Regional Climate
[SPEAKER_04]: Center themselves create.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Stuart's wilt disease for corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this shows the risk of the bacteria
having overwintered in the flea beetle
[SPEAKER_04]: that vectors the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the temperatures in the winter are
really, really cold, then the bacterium is
[SPEAKER_04]: killed in the flea beetle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are also some tools that
they have on their site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we link to their tools, and they also
link to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have this cross-linkage thing going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a shot of what the weather
station looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, complete with cables, software,
everything, is a little under $2,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the page on the Newell website
that tells the grower how to buy a weather
[SPEAKER_04]: instrument and get it connected in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have done some work on maintenance
and troubleshooting guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I will point out is that these
are no longer configured with the weak
[SPEAKER_04]: wetness sensor on the south side.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were all solar powered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this weak wetness sensor is now
attached to the rain bucket on the north
[SPEAKER_04]: side at a 45-degree angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rainwise has helped us with file transfer
protocol software to get our data into our
[SPEAKER_04]: database.
[SPEAKER_04]: They now, most of our stations,
are connected with what they call the
[SPEAKER_04]: IP100.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is automatically beamed via the
internet to their website, Rainwise Net.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we scrape the data off their
website into our system.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fall, we're going to be developing an
API so that we can start ingesting
[SPEAKER_04]: one-minute data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growers want one-minute data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rainwise wants to deliver one-minute data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have some tools and products
that they themselves have developed,
[SPEAKER_04]: frost alarms and things like that,
that they would like to be able to market
[SPEAKER_04]: to their clientele.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've also helped us develop
different products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weather station numbers have really
grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I became lead of NUA in 2005 and got a few
grants to just nominally increase the
[SPEAKER_04]: network into eastern New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was primarily rich in the central New
York area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then things got really popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people started buying and installing
the instruments in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: As of 2016, we have all of these states
that are full state members.
[SPEAKER_04]: This green bar here is New Jersey,
because New Jersey, the state climatology
[SPEAKER_04]: office, joined and wrote programming to
deliver their entire climatology mezzanine
[SPEAKER_04]: of data into our system, which was really
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew by almost 40 weather instruments
within a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is that in 2010,
essentially, the plug was pulled on
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural IPM funding for New York
State.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got my letter saying that I wasn't
going to have a job in six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were all kind of bummed out in IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, for the 2011 fiscal
year, and you can see the blue bar drops
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the 2011 fiscal year, no funding at
all was reinstated for New York at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was faced with a $5,000 phone bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every single modem connected weather
instrument was eliminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And growers were given the option to
purchase a randomized instrument.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that had a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, Massachusetts and
Vermont were interested in joining Newark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was the perfect scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, OK, you can join, but you have
to pay a fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so thus was born fiscal
irresponsibility in Newark and among all
[SPEAKER_04]: of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has since created almost a
nightmare of growth to the point where
[SPEAKER_04]: although I'm only supposed to be devoting
5% to 10% of my time on Newark,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm devoting a little bit more than that,
as you can well imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are now going to be hiring a Newark
coordinator in IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were successful in getting a grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were able to fund that position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our ad IPM funding this year was
reinstated to the 2010 level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was really exciting, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helped us immensely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just to give you all the logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have, I know we're moving away from
printed and into more hieroglyphic
[SPEAKER_04]: communication in our sort of language
base.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all our current partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that's really exciting is
that the state of Minnesota and the state
[SPEAKER_04]: of North Carolina are full members because
of the apple-curvohydrate substitutions in
[SPEAKER_04]: those states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably the biggest driver is the
apple-curvohydrate thinning law.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has revolutionized apple thinning.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new partners have been coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been talking with the state
primatology offices in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the exciting thing is EnviroWeather
started collaborating with us this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just putting the finishing touches
on programming the ingestion of their data
[SPEAKER_04]: from their state primatology network.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also have a newer type system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have models that could benefit us
as well as the models that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: They mostly want the apple thinning law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a New York state
mezzanine that's being constructed right
[SPEAKER_04]: now across New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Funded by FEMA after Sandy and Irene
devastated Manson Valley, Long Island,
[SPEAKER_04]: and New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are embarking on talks with them to
see whether we can get their data.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Climate Smart Farming Group,
Cornell Institute for Climate Smart
[SPEAKER_04]: Solutions, is developing some tools for
climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm excited about what they are going
to be developing because then that's
[SPEAKER_04]: something else I can link to on NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it provides an additional benefit to
our users.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this fall we'll be talking with Glenn
Koehler at the University of Maine to see
[SPEAKER_04]: about getting ad radar models that he has
for apples embedded into NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our stakeholder priorities, obviously the
top one is sustainable funding,
[SPEAKER_04]: responsive web design, more station
locations via the use of the National
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital Forecast Database, which has about
a one kilometer resolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: More apps, alerts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many growers want to be able to save their
green tip date or to save that seeding
[SPEAKER_04]: date or whatever it is that they are
putting in as an input for their biofix.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd like NUA to save that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't set up to do that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Station maintenance, troubleshooting,
promoting awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a planning meeting among all of our
members and out of that came four
[SPEAKER_04]: objectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We definitely want a responsive web
design.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, NUA does work okay on a
smartphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some platforms that some of the
map products don't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we definitely need this.
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA premium products would allow us to
charge potentially a subscription fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were to develop an end user cache
and have a premium site to NUA,
[SPEAKER_04]: you may be able to have a subscription and
thus improve our funding base and
[SPEAKER_04]: eliminate the need for the yearly fees
that are paid by the land grant
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The virtual stations, that was third.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fourth objective we talked
about was to create a developer sandbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would essentially be behind the
scenes where the researcher, developer
[SPEAKER_04]: could go in, they could create a tool,
see if it's working, validate it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then if it's working well,
make it implemented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be awesome?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Julie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of data, I mean weather data
research have we been up to?
[SPEAKER_04]: We did create a leaf wetness estimator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to have that for airport locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have leaf wetness sensors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did a little bit of work on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more work that needs to be done on
that, but we are estimating leaf wetness
[SPEAKER_04]: for any hour with relative humidity above
90.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're counting that as a wet hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't gotten any complaints yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are using, oh, and I should say that
the airport relative humidity is error
[SPEAKER_04]: corrected because it's surrounded by
tarmac and the, it's not biome,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the microclimate there is vastly
different from an agricultural setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are looking at data quality control for
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Degoutano Climate Center is working on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Keith Edelson, who works with the
Climate Center, looks at the solar
[SPEAKER_04]: radiation data periodically and eliminates
stations with bad solar radiation data
[SPEAKER_04]: from the Apple Thinning Tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to be looking at
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a project for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really great to be able to do
research to compare that national digital
[SPEAKER_04]: forecast database with our on the ground
stations and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: The meteorologists and climatologists tell
me that's a really fertile ground
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right now they're looking at soil
temperature estimates compared to actual
[SPEAKER_04]: soil sensors that are being placed in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our Degoutano's group developed a soil
temperature estimate map for us that we
[SPEAKER_04]: are planning to implement in a weed
germination model down the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently funded, we have developed a
7-day scale model for apples.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's new this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Art Agnello developed that with the Apple
Research and Development Program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kerrick Cox and I are looking to
incorporate the epiphytic infection
[SPEAKER_04]: potential from Mary Blight into the Apple
Fire Blight Tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Blight is a copyrighted model.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's freely available online, but we can't
just incorporate it into it because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alan Biggs at the University of
Maryland has been working with Kerrick on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Betsy Lam in IPM got a grant from the New
York Farm Viability Institute to develop
[SPEAKER_04]: woody ornamental insect ingredient tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Christmas tree growers are really
jazzed about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg Loeb, Kerrick Cox, and I got some
funding from the New York Berry Growers
[SPEAKER_04]: Association to develop berry insect and
disease models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be embarking on that this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Annemiek Schilder has an SCRI planning
grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is an alum here from Croyall.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a faculty member at Michigan State
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will be on blueberry fruit pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a wish list of over 40 models.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's just, you know,
as many research you guys do on all this
[SPEAKER_04]: great work, we're going to try to
implement it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are the impacts and outcomes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So NUA is transforming weather knowledge
into tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers are sharing their weather data,
resources through cloud computing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the forecasts are pushing the results
out five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably go a week, and the
meteorologists wouldn't get too nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes these actually disease
forecast models.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were always called disease
forecast models, but we only had weather
[SPEAKER_04]: data to say, oh, too bad, you had an apple
scab infection two days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't do anything about that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of exciting to be able to,
you know, forecast this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some anecdotes from growers that I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the newest site almost every day
early in the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one was a little more
denigrating towards a system that had
[SPEAKER_04]: previously been used, but the person was
saying the orchard manager was scab free
[SPEAKER_04]: for the first time in several years,
and the orchard manager had relied heavily
[SPEAKER_04]: on NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Wynn Cowgill from Rutgers said that
two New Jersey apple growers reported the
[SPEAKER_04]: best thinning results ever in 2015 using
the newest apple thinning tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I would say that NUA promotes
better IPM, reduced pesticide use,
[SPEAKER_04]: and improved environmental protection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better crop management, improved crop
quality, and improved yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly enhanced decision support.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2007, before we launched the website I
just showed you, we launched that website
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2009.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like geriatric now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really geriatric.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 2007, when we surveyed growers
about the impact of NUA on IPM,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see that the vast majority agreed
or strongly agreed that NUA helps reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: sprays, improve spray timing, alert up
pesticides, reduce risk, and enhance IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growers in that survey reported that they
would save on average $19,500 per year in
[SPEAKER_04]: spray costs and prevent a quarter of a
million dollars per year in crop loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are high value horticultural
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are primarily apple growers,
grape growers, and a few onion and potato
[SPEAKER_04]: growers that were responding to this
survey back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our audience is much larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And broader now, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this piece, I didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went over these web stats, I think
probably four times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are experiencing over two million
page views per year.
[SPEAKER_04]: A page view is when somebody spends at
least 30 minutes on your web page.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a click and I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a page view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So NUA is access to IPM decision support.
[SPEAKER_04]: And IPM is all about sustainable
management of pests using methods that
[SPEAKER_04]: minimize environmental, health,
and economic risks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using plant disease epidemiology,
insect phenology, plant phenology,
[SPEAKER_04]: and crop management information and
creating phenological models and
[SPEAKER_04]: forecasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing pretty good in fruit and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do a lot better in ornamentals
and field crops, and even livestock.
[SPEAKER_04]: NUA is open access, real-time,
prairie-based decision support with
[SPEAKER_04]: built-in biofix and an interactive user
interface.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 40 tools on our wish list.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want more station locations and end
user cache, alarms, better data quality
[SPEAKER_04]: control and support, and a developer
sandbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'll thank you and open it
up for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is, would you describe that the
populations of station owners consist of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and airports?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there another population?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had that slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people who own weather stations
include growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They include land-grant universities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the University of Connecticut Mesonet
that's connected to NUA, all their
[SPEAKER_04]: rain-wise instruments are owned by UConn.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some land-grant universities decide
they're going to grant fund their entire
[SPEAKER_04]: Mesonet and plug it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do it typically on farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Connecticut wanted one in every county.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think those are on schools or above
turf grass, so lawns and that type of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a rain-wise connected instrument
at the Arnold Arboretum, Harvard
[SPEAKER_04]: University's Botanical Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a weather station in the
Adirondacks that's really associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: a natural area.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the person who installed it wanted
degree days because they do research on
[SPEAKER_04]: insects and insect phenology.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are the state Mesonets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rutgers Mesonet, they have,
I think, three different styles of weather
[SPEAKER_04]: instruments plugged in.
[SPEAKER_04]: To their Mesonet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's another group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by and large, we try to ask the
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, we had Champlain Valley
agronomics join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have 22 rain-wise instruments in the
Adirondacks in the Champlain Valley,
[SPEAKER_04]: primarily on dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they use the data because confined
people, confined animal feeders and
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding operations, cannot spread manure
unless they have a record of the weather
[SPEAKER_04]: before and after they spread that manure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that report was essential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy knows a lot about rain-wise
instruments, so that's kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned a figure of five predicting
days, a generalization that I took.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that the biology of the
pathogen is set to infect, if I can put it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way, during that five-day period.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather previously has set that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let me go further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was after the fact that I did
not hear in the presentation the role of
[SPEAKER_01]: incoming weather plays in terms of the
development of that disease once
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else is aligned for disease to
occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So predominantly, or for the most part,
the models are predicting an infection
[SPEAKER_04]: event.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's getting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what about symptom development?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the infection process and the
development of symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the incoming weather is going to
trigger the disease once you have all
[SPEAKER_01]: those other items lined up on a five-day
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on the model, the things that
may be lining up could be hourly data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the model may need hourly data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the insect models only need daily
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only need the max and the min.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the weather, there are only,
I think, two instances where we're looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at development of disease and disease
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is for apple scab and the other is for
fire blight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'm answering your question,
Jim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to make this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a grower's standpoint, if you've got
that information that disease can occur
[SPEAKER_01]: during this five-day period based upon the
forecast, then I, as a grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: would be paying real attention to the
incoming weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to make a big difference
whether I'm going to apply a square.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grower's got to play a role in this
in terms of making that spray decision
[SPEAKER_01]: based upon what he gets from other
sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a really very good point
because all of this is just what the
[SPEAKER_04]: grower sees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, it's the grower that's
going to make the decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some apple farms have gotten so large
that they can't cover in one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their sprayers cost a quarter of a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they only have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they need five days to cover their
orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the size of the operation
has to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are all kinds of things that
weigh in on a grower's decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We measured, I'm sorry, okay, the question
is did we measure the economic impact of
[SPEAKER_04]: this program in a systematic way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being an economist or, what I did was
I developed questions for the survey that
[SPEAKER_04]: basically were asking the respondents to
fill in how much it was saving them in
[SPEAKER_04]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much it was saving them estimated in
crop loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to go back to that 2007 survey to
see exactly how those were worded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your wish list public?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if a developer's looking for a
project and they go, what a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, I am so looking forward to having
a new coordinator on board so they can get
[SPEAKER_04]: this wish list and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of curious about the business
end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that this is incorporated as
a not-for-profit under Cornell's banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that realm, I wondered about
issues, okay, but I wondered about issues
[SPEAKER_02]: of intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did notice the disclaimers on most of
your pages, but you've got a very complex
[SPEAKER_02]: stew of intellectual property from all
sorts of sources here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wondered, you know,
how that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to repeat the question about IP?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll start with the disclaimers because
that's the easy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The easy part.
[SPEAKER_04]: About the time funding was just,
you know, I didn't, we didn't know it was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But about that time, I was poised to fully
disclose NUA to Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we no longer had funding,
I had a lot more to do than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we did get done with Cornell
Needle is we got the disclaimers written.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the disclaimer on the website in total
will talk about things like accuracy of
[SPEAKER_04]: the data, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: The disclaimers on each individual tool
will talk about this is a tool and only a
[SPEAKER_04]: tool and it is not a substitute for actual
field observations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of intellectual property writing,
we have based all of the models that I
[SPEAKER_04]: know of at this point on published
literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, I don't think there would be an
intellectual property writing issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are developers who develop things
beyond NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll try a case in point from a point
decision support system which now is
[SPEAKER_04]: called Light Growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another potential would be the DL-CAS
model where, you know, some company might
[SPEAKER_04]: come along and say, to the person who's
primarily responsible for that research,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, I'd like to develop an app for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, at this point, not fully disclosed
NUA.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have done is all the references for
these models are posted online.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the key one or two references for every
model that we have in NUA is there online.
[SPEAKER_04]: In its own place, it's not actually with
the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe in the future we need to be with
the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't done that and hope that I
won't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Julie, thank you very much for a really
interesting talk.
Let's thank Julie one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
