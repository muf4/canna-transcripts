[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today my topic is called Everything's
Coming Up Dally is talking about how not
[SPEAKER_03]: just I but a bunch of other people in
Extension are starting to create a system
[SPEAKER_03]: to support the cut flower industry in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many, do you have any grower,
cut flower growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so how many people have plot flowers
at a farmer's market?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have a flower CSA?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well there's at least three.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about roadside stands?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how about done you pick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and how about the vents?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this picture is to show that flowers
either even just growing fields of
[SPEAKER_03]: sunflowers is a big deal for weddings and
flowers getting your flowers look flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: for weddings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to see if you've done
any of those things you've seen that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of cut flowers available
that didn't used to be there used to be
[SPEAKER_03]: florists and maybe grocery stores but
we're making progress and where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in New York State the wholesale value
of cut flower sales increased one and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half times between 2020 to 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty dramatic and now that's only
looking at operations of a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will guarantee you that we have a
lot of small cut flower farms that are not
[SPEAKER_03]: up at a hundred thousand in terms of what
they're bringing in a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the numbers that I can find are
definitely going to be under estimates.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the 2019 census it said
there are 122 operations with 2.7 million
[SPEAKER_03]: in sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the association of
specially cut flower growers that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: growers are members but not all you can
find about 130 in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's at least that much let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the questions if you want to work
with them is how do you find them and what
[SPEAKER_03]: do they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just looking at what's been done so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is from one of the cut flower
growers actually had on their website New
[SPEAKER_03]: York Flower Farms it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is looking at the major
distribution methods for the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot that are doing selling to
the individual consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be a CSA or farmers market
or roadside stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some that are selling direct to
florists so you can sometimes get local
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers at your florist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some that are wholesaling
and maybe often in combination with
[SPEAKER_03]: selling direct and possibly with selling
to florists.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that's amazing when you
talk to cut flower growers is how many
[SPEAKER_03]: different things they're doing to sell
their flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often they cycle through a variety of
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry something just happened over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cycle through a variety of different
marketing systems to find out the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: works best for them with their production
how big they want to be and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I will say about
cut flower growers is they tend to be
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty entrepreneurial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure whether that's by
necessity or just that's the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: start out trying to do cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the floriculture industry is definitely
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find lots of articles about
growing cut flowers in the trade journals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers aren't waiting for us to get
information to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're starting this is a Facebook
page for central New York flower growers
[SPEAKER_03]: or upstate New York flower growers where
there's a lot of conversation back and
[SPEAKER_03]: forth about not just what's for sale or
prices or how to sale or does somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: have something but pest management
information and some other production
[SPEAKER_03]: information as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you can become grown in New York
State grown and certified for cut flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: and not all of those crops came in at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a more recent one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't I would like to find out how
many are on this list but I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: figured out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So working with cut flower growers in New
York State is not completely new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who's been in this department for a
while knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at Cooperative Extension
they've been doing some programming mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: on usually on a one off basis often very
regional and it may depend on if they have
[SPEAKER_03]: growers asking them questions or if they
have some background information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Russ Welser for example in Ontario
County grew peonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had background information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he knew the cut flower growers and he
did some programming for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have about five counties in the
state that actually have educators who
[SPEAKER_03]: have commercial horticulture as their
specific stated responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't mean those are the only
extension educators who are doing things
[SPEAKER_03]: like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all do things sort of its duties as
assigned or as you get questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does commercial horticulture mean
horticulture or does it mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It means not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it means cut flower could be could be
floriculture greenhouse floriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas trees any of those things but
it's not consumer horticulture which is
[SPEAKER_03]: master gardeners and those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not apples and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tends not to be fruit or vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floriculture more so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean if you consider a Christmas tree a
floriculture crop and nursery and other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then there has been some occasional
statewide programming at the Empire State
[SPEAKER_03]: Producers Expo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been done a couple of times but
nothing too consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Dr. Wien who was here and did picked
up also picked up cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone told him to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he just picked it up as a
potential population to work with and did
[SPEAKER_03]: great research on cultivating cultivar
evaluation, cultural practices,
[SPEAKER_03]: high tunnel production and you can still
find his research which is all archived
[SPEAKER_03]: down the high tunnels web page.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing about doing cultivar
evaluation is of course cultivars keep
[SPEAKER_03]: changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while that information is great it may
not have the newest cultivars but other
[SPEAKER_03]: things the production information is all
valuable still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have related research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both Bill and Neil have done things
that relate to cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill I'm trying to sign up another place
for you to use your bulb machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it is and bulbs are becoming one of
the major cut flowers that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: also with some winter production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's people that are doing
pest management and ornamental.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dan Gilrein, Marjorie Daugherty both on
Long Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Sanderson here on campus and Andy
Senasek down on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both Andy and John have sort of retired
but luckily they'll still answer when we
[SPEAKER_03]: ask them questions and appear for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good thing because we're
starting to run out of people to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: questions unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then back in 2017 Lily Calderwood was
the extension educator for the capital
[SPEAKER_03]: area extension team and she had so many
calls on cut flowers that she decided to
[SPEAKER_03]: put up together an annual cut flower
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that conference has been running since
2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the longest running cut flower
conference that we have in the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually managed to go through
three educators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lily started it then Lindsay
Christiansen carried it on and Jing Jing
[SPEAKER_03]: Yin is now doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a regional program of five
counties but the conference is open to
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone online in the last few years
which means it can reach some additional
[SPEAKER_03]: people than it did before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Small Farms has an online cut
flower production class that they started
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: I co-teach it with Hannah Volkow who runs
Foxy Flora around Tremonsburg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in three years we're in the middle
of teaching the fourth one tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had 235 students and that's not just
New York State that's international but
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a goodly number coming in through
just that one point just through the Small
[SPEAKER_03]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have good advertising but still
it's a good number coming in and we have
[SPEAKER_03]: people that wish we would make an advanced
level of it also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do get it's advertised to be sort of
zero to three years in cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get some people who had more and it's
but because they're all at different
[SPEAKER_03]: levels it's an interesting method of
teaching where you're trying to not bore
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones who know stuff and keep the ones
who are just getting started from having
[SPEAKER_03]: their heads blow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is really information overload
because we're only doing it in six one and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half hour sessions and trying to cover
all of not just pest management but all of
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flower production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for my observation of the people that
are coming to that class and also going to
[SPEAKER_03]: other events they get into the business of
cut flower growers get into the business
[SPEAKER_03]: from the widest variety of backgrounds you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got bankers we've got tech tech
people we've got people who are growing
[SPEAKER_03]: some other kind of crop maybe vegetables
or dairy farms where they're adding cut
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers to their production.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who have no concept of how to grow
anything because they've not really done
[SPEAKER_03]: it before and people who have lots of
experience and it doesn't mean that any of
[SPEAKER_03]: those people can't be successful because
we find people from all of those starting
[SPEAKER_03]: points who are concurrently successful in
the state and so that's kind of a fun
[SPEAKER_03]: group to work with because they bring
different things to the to the mix and one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the things we're always trying to do in
something like this class is to have them
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to each other so that if you've got
information and you may well have more
[SPEAKER_03]: information than I have then let's you
know let's share it let's make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody gets it and has a chance to to
share that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually a meme that Amara Dunn
made up for us when we were establishing
[SPEAKER_03]: the habitat for beneficial insects but I
have a feeling it's also true for cut
[SPEAKER_03]: flower growers it looks like they're
beautiful flowers all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_03]: put seeds in the ground and you have
beautiful flowers but you always forget
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's weeding and there's whether
your soil is doing what it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do and what insects come in so that's
often true that they start out thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: okay this is going to be easy I saw cut
flowers at the farm market and I've grown
[SPEAKER_03]: a few cut flowers in my yard and so
production is going to be just like that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not always sometimes so just based on
that that's sort of the past history of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's been going on in New York State
with product with information for cut
[SPEAKER_03]: flower but then starting in 2021 I got a
call from Dana Havis who was in Cortland
[SPEAKER_03]: CCE, Cornell Community Extension,
sorry, CCE is I can't put Cortland and
[SPEAKER_03]: community in there is the Cornell
Cooperative Extension, CCE well I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: probably say CCE a bunch of times but
anyway so out of Cortland and she was
[SPEAKER_03]: getting so many questions she was actually
a fiber person that's where her background
[SPEAKER_03]: was in fiber but she said I'm getting so
many questions and before Lindsay
[SPEAKER_03]: Fishingson left the capital district she
told everybody apparently if you have any
[SPEAKER_03]: questions on cut flowers call Betsy even
though Betsy didn't know anything about
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flowers but was interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we came up with sort of a mission of
what we'd like to do what the issue is the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that there's not much background for
cut flower growers in the state and could
[SPEAKER_03]: we put something together that would help
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually did we based on a listserv
that we have we'll pop up later we
[SPEAKER_03]: actually did some some questions on grower
needs and educator needs and the educator
[SPEAKER_03]: needs kind of look like we need everything
we don't have enough to do for anything we
[SPEAKER_03]: need the industry we need speakers we need
programming we need all of them and the
[SPEAKER_03]: growers come across have needed almost all
of it as well we weed management how to
[SPEAKER_03]: plant schedules how to price things is a
huge aspect how to use high tunnels what
[SPEAKER_03]: and then so fertility so there's a lot of
places that information could go in and
[SPEAKER_03]: also a lot of people who are looking for
information to help fill those gaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is sort of the initial group that
started talking so Sharon Bachman is in
[SPEAKER_03]: Erie County Caroline is in Yates County I
believe Russ Walters in Ontario County
[SPEAKER_03]: Jing Jing is for the capital district
Carla Crims in Delaware and Lindsay Pascho
[SPEAKER_03]: is in I don't remember one of the
northeastern counties and so actually both
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay and Russ have grown cut flowers so
they come in with some background
[SPEAKER_03]: information which is helpful but most of
the other people are just getting
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and so are interested in trying
to put something together that works to
[SPEAKER_03]: help support them in the questions they're
getting and actually this group has now
[SPEAKER_03]: created a cut flower program work team
which makes sense if you're a faculty
[SPEAKER_03]: member maybe it probably doesn't make
sense at all if you're if you're in a
[SPEAKER_03]: student program work teams are groupings
of faculty and extension faculty who are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in a particular topic so this
is now sort of just gives it a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of formality for the university.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing that we did Dana and I
was put together this listserv and just
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of send out information who's
interested I could do it through the class
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit this is an old picture but it
does show you at least that we have people
[SPEAKER_03]: on the listserv from all around the state
as well as outside of the state and the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest point for having a listserv is how
do we find and connect growers and
[SPEAKER_03]: educators that's what we're looking for
and it is an interesting system in that it
[SPEAKER_03]: is definitely not hi we know what's going
on and we're here to tell you what how to
[SPEAKER_03]: do things it is much more a we're looking
for help can you help us do the what needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be done so that we can get this
information out to a broader range of
[SPEAKER_03]: growers so anyone can post on it it's not
it's not wildly used at the moment but it
[SPEAKER_03]: does get used somewhat I need some
organization and every once in a while if
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working if I'm doing what I should be
I'll post a question but I usually can get
[SPEAKER_03]: some responses back which is nice to know
that people are actually reading and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we also created a webpage which is a blogs
.cornell.edu slash cut flowers and so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's another place of gathering
information and posting it in one place so
[SPEAKER_03]: people can find things and then again we
this should be something where we're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting more two-way information but it's
it's getting it's not there yet but then
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the just the programming that's
going on based on the fact that there are
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were interested it's
definitely expanding so this is a risk
[SPEAKER_03]: management for cut flower growers grant
that Carla Krim got and she put on a free
[SPEAKER_03]: series of webinars in 2022 and 2023
looking at risk but risk in a broad sense
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can see there's IPM there's crop
planning there's climate smart fine
[SPEAKER_03]: farming there's a season extension all
sorts of topics that were in her series
[SPEAKER_03]: and well this is just an example of she
also had not just special list talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about things but growers so this is Fran
Parrish who her operation is over in
[SPEAKER_03]: Western New York and she does an excellent
job at putting on presentations and
[SPEAKER_03]: gathering information from the point of
view of a grower which is always nice to
[SPEAKER_03]: have it's one thing for me to talk about
IPM but I'm not trying to make money doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it so having a growers perspective on it
is also nice and then you that's difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: to read in the back I'm sure but it's just
a list of the different speakers that they
[SPEAKER_03]: had in the capital district cut flower
conference for 2023 is online then it's
[SPEAKER_03]: also going to be online in 2024 I think
it's probably going to stay online forever
[SPEAKER_03]: but again quite a range of topics and
bringing in both growers and faculty from
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell and potentially other places as
well there's somebody from the University
[SPEAKER_03]: of Utah they did a they did the first cut
flower session at the Catskill regional
[SPEAKER_03]: regional ag conference and they're going
to do that again in 2024 again mixing
[SPEAKER_03]: speakers from a variety of different
places and then Long Island also added a
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flower session to their ag forum so
it's definitely popping up in a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: places we're seeing a lot more programming
it may or may not be very organized
[SPEAKER_03]: compared from one to the next but at least
it's showing up so that the cut flower
[SPEAKER_03]: growers have something to go and listen to
this was a called a cut flower intensive
[SPEAKER_03]: at Birdsong farm CCE Delaware has a an
association with this farm and they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually put in cut flower beds to use for
demonstrations and kind of as community
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens and so they had speakers and then
had people they pick flowers for people
[SPEAKER_03]: and they had them do sort of an Iron Chef
arrangement competition they were making
[SPEAKER_03]: this one was on the summer barbecue so
they it was amazing to see what people did
[SPEAKER_03]: there's peppers in there there's what they
did in terms of creating arrangements on
[SPEAKER_03]: that topic and I think they enjoyed doing
that I didn't I didn't get my fingers in
[SPEAKER_03]: that one we're also looking at getting
some more on-farm programming of growers
[SPEAKER_03]: in my estimation love hearing other
growers talk about what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a good way to get connections and
again this was some soil health
[SPEAKER_03]: programming that changing the input on
she's on the far right and it's another
[SPEAKER_03]: place you can see and it's hard maybe tell
us a little picture but the audience and
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flower growers tends to be younger
than the other audiences that I serve in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of ornamental production they tend
to be more female and they had they come
[SPEAKER_03]: in ready to roll and with lots of great
ideas and that's kind of fun to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to them because and they'll correct
you if they think you're wrong which is
[SPEAKER_03]: also so we're looking at doing some
additional getting some funding to help
[SPEAKER_03]: support some of this so in the capital
district they wrote the Northeast
[SPEAKER_03]: extension risk management education fund
grant on cut flower pricing because
[SPEAKER_03]: pricing is a huge huge issue jing jing
wrote one for a flaw of farm viability on
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crops and field and high tunnel for
cut flower production and we've put in an
[SPEAKER_03]: application for a cce intern this more
this for the summer working in cut flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: in cce delaware so i'm talking really fast
and we'll see where we go here so one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the questions that I have for you is like
why should you care so I can see
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities for on-farm research because
these growers are looking for information
[SPEAKER_03]: and help and they're pretty willing to to
let faculty come on their farms and work
[SPEAKER_03]: on them I see opposition I see potential
for positions for students either as
[SPEAKER_03]: growers or in extension and knowing more
about cut flowers but I want to know what
[SPEAKER_03]: potential you see for in the horticulture
section for cut flowers so I get to stare
[SPEAKER_03]: at all of you instead of you staring at me
so anybody have any ideas so anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: online have any ideas they're shy shy is
everyone using landscape fabric betsy I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: curious so it's interesting so because
brian's a weed scientist he would ask a
[SPEAKER_03]: weed science word a question so some
people do use landscape fabric and plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and hole through holes in the landscape
fabric and for some of the things I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen dahlias on it for sure I've seen
peonies on it peonies tend to stay there
[SPEAKER_03]: longer and some people don't like it
because you get dirt on top of it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you get weeds on top of it and so they're
using all sorts of different things for
[SPEAKER_03]: weed management I have not yet heard of
too many people complaining about
[SPEAKER_03]: herbicide resistant weeds in their
operations but it made you just be that
[SPEAKER_03]: they haven't figured out that that's
really happening yet so there's been there
[SPEAKER_03]: was a big debate in on one of the one of
the discussions we had was on do you use I
[SPEAKER_03]: also say just to throw in to kind of go
with this conversation that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: growers that I talked to either want to be
organic or are organic sometimes wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to be organic may or may not mean that
they actually know what it means to be
[SPEAKER_03]: certified organic but they would like to
not use pesticides including herbicides
[SPEAKER_03]: and they would like to use something else
so when you start talking about just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting down plastic mulch the question
comes up well should you use biodegradable
[SPEAKER_03]: or degradable plastic mulch and most of
the growers who tried it said no because
[SPEAKER_03]: what you end up with is a lot of pieces of
plastic you can actually remove the non
[SPEAKER_03]: biodegradable stuff much more easily than
the biodegradable stuff but that's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the things that seems to have popped up
multiple times in terms of weed management
[SPEAKER_03]: so I know why I'm interested so I'll tell
you why I'm interested and why I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's potential for this so I just in
terms of the IPM programming I wrote this
[SPEAKER_03]: is my fifth presentation this year on cut
flowers so there's obviously interest and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not counted with class and there's
obviously people that are trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: that programming going it also looks to me
like as I said the interest is in organic
[SPEAKER_03]: or no or low pesticides inputs the
understanding of pest management varies
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatically and I don't see through the
association and other things I don't see
[SPEAKER_03]: very much pest management information out
there so it seems like to me it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect place for me to be that there's a
need there's a lot that's where my steep
[SPEAKER_03]: learning curve comes in because I don't
necessarily know the answers but that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's that there's someone who's looking
for the information and they're willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: work in two ways with me which I enjoy so
what's different about pest management for
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flowers the crop diversity is immense
between species and cultivars it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of field and high tunnel often
they have sequential planting and long
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest periods which I don't see in
things like bedding plants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse production for example the
aesthetic level means because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: selling both the flowers and the leaves
often that the threshold pest thresholds
[SPEAKER_03]: are really low so they need good pest
management and can't top tolerate very
[SPEAKER_03]: much damage so how many crops other crops
do you know where they would actually go
[SPEAKER_03]: back out and bag every flower bud that
they're going to sell which they do with
[SPEAKER_03]: dahlias for a tarnished plant bun damage
so and interestingly what the grower said
[SPEAKER_03]: oh yeah it's not that problem not that big
a problem I don't know it just seems like
[SPEAKER_03]: it would take an inordinate amount of time
and it's also a very high value crop so
[SPEAKER_03]: all those things work together to mean
that pest management information is really
[SPEAKER_03]: essential in my mind and sort of fun to
learn about how to do so just in looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at the kinds of projects that I'm looking
at there's pest management a strategic
[SPEAKER_03]: plan funding from the Northeast IPM Center
looking at identifying the major insect
[SPEAKER_03]: and disease pests and what the management
methods current are currently are so you
[SPEAKER_03]: can use that information to determine what
to do next what research could be done
[SPEAKER_03]: next and then some work looking at both
augmentative and conservation by out
[SPEAKER_03]: control and cut flower beds conservation
by out control means using what's already
[SPEAKER_03]: there and encouraging it augmentative
really means going out and adding it so
[SPEAKER_03]: you're buying commercial sources we don't
that's very there's very little
[SPEAKER_03]: information on that the conservation one
there's more information on but it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to measure and so figuring out
how to measure it is another piece all
[SPEAKER_03]: right I think that's the end of mine and I
maybe even came in sort of on time or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe too short but it's lovely yes you
have a question lots of lots of questions
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure um how do so most of the cut
flowers that Americans consume from
Colombia and Ecuador places that have a
favorable climate year-round and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper labor and then airplane
transportation so how do New York cut
[SPEAKER_02]: flower growers differentiate themselves
from those types of products sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the crops are growing so ranunculus
is a big thing for spring and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting I was talking to a grower
that's in Clifton Springs Phelps area and
[SPEAKER_03]: she said well she's not emphasizing the
summer flowers anymore she's really
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing ranunculus and she's got high
tunnels because at a farmers market which
[SPEAKER_03]: is where she sells and also through a CSA
she said people are dying for color in the
[SPEAKER_03]: spring so you can sell a lot of ranunculus
which are expensive and so there's that
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of differentiating by crop by some
things that just don't ship well there's
[SPEAKER_03]: you know there's enough of a local
interest in local food and local flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: and local everything that that helps so
they can promote themselves as local it is
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's an expensive product and
it's one that's considered maybe a luxury
[SPEAKER_03]: by some people and so that does perhaps
limit the potential sales through just
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the the whole population but
and so sometimes it's also the variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: things that you can get but I do think
there's a certain amount of it it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's nice to go to a farmers market and
walk out with a bunch of flowers and and
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think there's some of that I think is
just people's interest in that whole local
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing and and going and just doing
the whole sort of almost agritourism of a
[SPEAKER_03]: local of local production
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a great question and one of the
things that the original this original
[SPEAKER_03]: talk went to be giving it in Pennsylvania
because they're trying to do the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing so it's not that there are none and
there are some states that have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: California has quite a lot and and some
states have more than most states have
[SPEAKER_03]: more than we do but some between actually
talking to not falling over the table and
[SPEAKER_03]: not standing with a light mind but so we
can find some but there doesn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_03]: like here's a what here's one good place
to go find this and then some things are
[SPEAKER_03]: regionally different so if you're talking
about producing ranunculus and in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: it's different than if you're talking
about producing ranunculus in California
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we need some of that as well
updating things to make that we're like
[SPEAKER_02]: here yeah that question might drive with
one that's turned up in Chad as well any
[SPEAKER_02]: research on possibility of using cut
flower crops searching as potential
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial insects habitat that you crop
along with other crops any farmers maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: even want to give up space so I've
actually been working on installing
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial habitat that's not cut flowers
necessarily in we've got a plot in
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas trees at the moment to see if
you can get the benefits of that
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial habitat on the insect pests in
the Christmas trees and you're right that
[SPEAKER_03]: takes up land and so it's a little bit
hard to do that and I agree that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: could do it and cut it and sell it then
you've got a then you've got an advantage
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's not just wasted land it's also
additional labor and some of these crops
[SPEAKER_03]: are pretty high labor some things that
people do are like start with sunflowers
[SPEAKER_03]: because you can seed in a row of
sunflowers they're pretty low maintenance
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of of getting them where you want
them they're not the highest value but
[SPEAKER_03]: people like them and and they still give
you some of those those environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits of bringing in beneficials and so
potentially then also seeing but then the
[SPEAKER_03]: question is can you measure the effect of
those beneficials on your other crop is a
[SPEAKER_03]: hard piece but you know it yes it
definitely can be done and the thing is
[SPEAKER_03]: always going to be balancing you know if
you're taking time away from your main
[SPEAKER_03]: crop you need something that's relatively
low labor and relatively high value per
[SPEAKER_03]: unit area just to break you did I cover
the one that they asked me yeah so that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of covers the concept of co-cropping
and there are people that are starting who
[SPEAKER_03]: have been growing vegetables are starting
to put cut flowers in especially if they
[SPEAKER_03]: market in the same ways it's it's a fairly
obvious connection I think sorry Bill so a
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect example not of that but of
co-cropping I guess this the ball planter
[SPEAKER_01]: and planting you pick sorts of things like
daffodils in turf grass there's no weeding
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no problem and I think it's
finally starting to catch on because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a importer here in New York who
brought in six machines this fall well and
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I know they sold three of them so
far so and it's an interesting thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because finally starting to come along you
pick is like one of the things where you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be careful that people don't go in
and trash your plants when they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: you pick but with tulips you actually want
them to pull the bulbs out they can pull
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole bulb out so if they take the
plant and and they don't actually cut it
[SPEAKER_03]: they pull the whole bulb out that's
actually a good thing because tulips are
[SPEAKER_03]: grown as an annual for cut flowers
definitely maybe even daffodils less so
[SPEAKER_02]: but well yeah they would they optimally
they would be perennials but but they tend
[SPEAKER_03]: not to give you as big flowers the second
generation just second year around and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth sometimes anyway but the way that
people feel about bulbs they often plant
[SPEAKER_02]: them as annuals yep yep it's interesting
to hear about how the industry's grown
[SPEAKER_02]: over New York State and how people are
coming in from a variety of different
[SPEAKER_02]: backgrounds I was wondering did you get a
feel for like why the industry's been
[SPEAKER_02]: growing so much and with people coming in
from so many different backgrounds are
[SPEAKER_02]: they all coming in for the same reasons
when you talk to these people well what do
[SPEAKER_02]: you find out why they're so interested in
cutting cut flowers one of the things is
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like oh I'm so sick of a dust job
I've heard that many many times and so
[SPEAKER_03]: again it kind of goes to Neil's question
of like so you could buy flowers in the
[SPEAKER_03]: grocery store you can buy flowers at a
florist why should you start growing your
[SPEAKER_03]: own because of this interest in local and
because I think people go to farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: markets and see road signs stands and hear
about you and CSAs and you picks they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like well I could do that and so it's it
is but it is interesting I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: another industry where they come from like
everywhere and you know just the concept
[SPEAKER_03]: of I don't want to work on a desk anymore
I want to be out in the dirt which I
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate but it's like okay but it's
kind of like it doesn't and also maybe the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing with cut flowers is you can start
kind of small and just grow a few rows of
[SPEAKER_03]: things and sell them at a roadside stand
without too much infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_03]: therefore you can kind of get into it that
way it's very interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: people adapt to once they get in they
think they're going to do these things and
[SPEAKER_02]: they end up doing those things sometimes
to someone else had a question yep I think
[SPEAKER_03]: so because yes I do think so it is you
know one of the things because I think one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pieces that needs to fit in there
is identifying the number of growers in
[SPEAKER_03]: any given area as I said with Lily
Calderwood she came in to do she was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: for culture but not cut flowers but there
were so many questions that she started
[SPEAKER_03]: adding that I think if we actually looked
at the industry and started documenting
[SPEAKER_03]: where these cut flower growers are there
would be you know it would be worthwhile
[SPEAKER_03]: for an extension office to say we need
somebody who has this background in this
[SPEAKER_03]: information and I think there's also
potential positions I actually know the
[SPEAKER_03]: first maybe not the first I know I know
someone who's actually a commercial scout
[SPEAKER_03]: for cut flowers farm now and that had
that's not something we don't have very
[SPEAKER_03]: many commercial scouts for ornamentals in
the state at all so the fact that this one
[SPEAKER_03]: cut flower farm said we need somebody from
outside we're too busy you know we're too
[SPEAKER_03]: busy doing other things we need somebody
from outside to actually we'll pay you to
[SPEAKER_03]: come in and scout for it so yeah I do
think so so good thank you I wonder if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's opportunities for attractive
plants to get to get pasts attract oh trap
[SPEAKER_02]: crops trap crops they are attractive but
hopefully you want them to be attractive
[SPEAKER_03]: so radishes for flea beetles is the one
that we actually but you can use and the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason one reason you use radishes is flea
beetles like them better than some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ornamentals but they also the seeds cheap
they grow fast you can put in a row of
[SPEAKER_03]: radishes attract attract the flea beetles
and then you need to do something there
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to either capture them which is
you know they do actually occasionally
[SPEAKER_03]: vacuum them or treat them with a pesticide
on the trap crop so that you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: letting them go back out into the crop
yeah so yeah there is yeah I think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people who are doing both and I
think people start with annuals this is
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly anecdotal but then they often will
start putting in some perennials I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: peonies is a good example because peonies
are really popular they're early they're
[SPEAKER_03]: gorgeous you know you can sell a lot of
peonies if you can grow them and so and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the next thing that people move into
in terms of perennials is starting putting
[SPEAKER_03]: in putting some woodies in so they've got
them for foliage or they've got them for
[SPEAKER_03]: large larger scale events where you need
big branches there's actually somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: from Cornell who's it's ag economist who's
now down in Maryland and their production
[SPEAKER_03]: is at Wenfei Uva and their production is
almost entirely woodies and so and mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: dormant some dormant but I think they do
both but they'll do yeah dormant branches
[SPEAKER_03]: as well yep so it is you know I think
again when people start out it's easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: start with annuals because that's kind of
the way they've been thinking but then
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to add in the other things and
even the concept then if you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: put in perennials if it's something like a
peonies any making sure that you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: plan for renovating them or renewing them
as you go along you look like you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask so one of the things striking is
this diversity of species and then I was
[SPEAKER_02]: working alongside a Chris out there with
the high titles there's this whole other
[SPEAKER_02]: component of that genotype environment
interaction like you know these things
[SPEAKER_02]: just respond so differently same genotype
based on how they're when they were seeded
[SPEAKER_02]: or what they're exposed to whether in a
high town or outside a high town so is
[SPEAKER_02]: there any group that's thinking like
strategically about what our priorities
[SPEAKER_02]: are to focus areas not that I just seems
like a system yeah not that I know of and
[SPEAKER_03]: it sometimes in term you mean in terms of
research or just in terms of understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think both are not very well known
and so yes so when you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when you're looking at repeated
plantings of things it's not the same each
[SPEAKER_03]: time even in terms of how long it takes
you to get a flower and what the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily look like so there's that
piece from the grower side but then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's also as far as I can tell the
research often is more based on like
[SPEAKER_03]: what's popular so or what you're getting
questions on so there's lots of questions
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's some on lavender because
lavender lots of people want to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: lavender it's and it's a nasty plan to go
I mean if you can get if you're in a place
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can grow it it's not a nasty
plant it's a lovely plant but it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: picky so if you've got a place you can
grow it it's great and again we have
[SPEAKER_03]: people go and say well look there's just
you just put that lavender out and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all set but their soil is different
and so it doesn't work so that gets a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain amount of work done on it but it
doesn't I don't have not seen even in this
[SPEAKER_03]: group that we're just kind of getting
going there's a little bit more discussion
[SPEAKER_03]: of okay should we write a grant together
and what should be on but overall I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't seen much of that saying okay
let's actually look at this these crops in
[SPEAKER_03]: enough depth to have that information to
be able to say here's kind of a fact sheet
[SPEAKER_03]: cookbook whatever that says okay if you're
growing this and I think there probably
[SPEAKER_03]: are some and a lot of them are if they are
out there they're they're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: probably created by growers you know
here's how you do sequential growth of
[SPEAKER_03]: this particular species but then you get
different varieties and the varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: change all the time and they don't always
necessarily act the same and color is this
[SPEAKER_03]: big issue of so Carla was doing a talk and
she showed some of the queen queen lime
[SPEAKER_03]: zinnias which are the sort of interesting
combination of pink and green and peach
[SPEAKER_03]: and salmon and green and chartreuse green
and and then also some lizzie anthus that
[SPEAKER_03]: are sort of dusty brownish pink which if
you look at them in on mass look dead to
[SPEAKER_03]: me but mixed in with a with a bouquet
they're very popular they're called very
[SPEAKER_03]: popular but mixed in a bouquet I think so
and that's the other thing is they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to keep up with an annual it's
easier with perennials like how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: keep up with what the next thing is always
there's everybody else any other questions
[SPEAKER_04]: from Thomas you have your hand up yeah
we've got a question for you it's
[SPEAKER_04]: basically how do things work around here
and for uh so how much the college invests
[SPEAKER_04]: or corporate extension invests in a
particular industry how that gets decided
[SPEAKER_04]: when um you notify something or notice a
new opportunity and I think that applies
[SPEAKER_04]: to everybody who's not in like dairy or
corn or soybeans do you find I mean you've
[SPEAKER_04]: described a very organic process where you
find that there's a need and find that
[SPEAKER_04]: there are other people who can help in
various parts of serving that industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you get some money and resources and
if it has legs it keeps growing have you
[SPEAKER_04]: found that there's other parts to the
system that are helping determine how much
[SPEAKER_04]: should be invested in the new agricultural
sector like this I have not I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked um I don't know if I know who
to ask but and and so again you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: think sometimes it takes a little bit of
information gathering I know I'm looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at your picture there a little bit of
information gathering and then putting it
[SPEAKER_03]: together and kind of presenting it to say
you know we could use more help here or
[SPEAKER_03]: what else can we do with this or don't you
think it'd be nice to have somebody doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it um whether or not that will fly at a
university I don't know and then there's
[SPEAKER_03]: also more other universities and colleges
than Cornell so someone else may pick it
[SPEAKER_03]: up um and and run with it too so they
don't have a really good answer for that
[SPEAKER_04]: no no but thanks for the look under the
hood moving along is most of the variety
[SPEAKER_02]: development done by like private companies
or is there a lot in like public libraries
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say the great majority is it is it
is it seed companies um it's not that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's none anywhere else um and then
there's some that's done by private
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals for certain cults for certain
species there's there's some that people
[SPEAKER_03]: are actually some kufflar growers are
doing themselves but also other people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are interested are doing I'm glad to
see what Bill's got well and some are
[SPEAKER_02]: ancient cultivars yeah you know peonies
some of those peonies forever right yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: we have it for now on mark written is
bread yeah I think those are the first
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plants added by Cornell they
could well be yeah and now it'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting to promote those to cut flower
growers and I don't know whether they're
[SPEAKER_03]: if they're aimed at garden varieties so
their stems are not long enough they're
[SPEAKER_02]: long enough yeah no idea but there were
some I don't know but they're there
[SPEAKER_02]: they're two and a half approaching three
feet and sometimes it's it's getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: word out and like where do people go
looking for their seed their seed usually
[SPEAKER_03]: seed but also plugs uh and so they don't
don't grow it off direct from seed and so
[SPEAKER_03]: some of it's like okay how do you get that
connection between the breeder the
[SPEAKER_03]: producer and the grower and so sometimes
again you do it backwards so you get the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower interested and get them to ask the
the suppliers
[SPEAKER_03]: other questions thank you for the question
I always like questions more than the
[SPEAKER_02]: topic thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: this has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu you you
