[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thanks Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As she said, my name is Jenna Hershberger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a second year grad student in Mike
Gore's lab and today I'll be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: one of several projects that I'm working
on and this one's called an Android
[SPEAKER_00]: application for near-infrared spectroscopy
based phenotyping of cassava quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project is part of a larger pheno
apps project that's funded by NSF and this
[SPEAKER_00]: project is led by Mike Gore as well as
Jesse Poland who was here a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main problem that the pheno apps
project is looking to address is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically when breeding programs take
notes it's by hand on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get bookshelves that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an actual photo from IITA of their
breeding data, also lovingly known as
[SPEAKER_00]: old-school cassava base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pheno apps integrate data collection
with the actual new cassava base out of
[SPEAKER_00]: BTI and that's one way that we are
increasing the efficiency with which
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs can take phenotypic
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond this, pheno apps also have the
possibility of collecting data that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible by hand such as spectral data and
image data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the other important parts of the
pheno apps project is workshops,
[SPEAKER_00]: so deployment of the apps and these are
pictures from a workshop that we held at
[SPEAKER_00]: IITA in March and so we trained breeders
on how to use the apps and ask for
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback on the apps that are being used
and then potential apps that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: developed in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked the breeders what traits are
you working on that could use a more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient tool and we got a lot of
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the them that we hadn't really
put too much thought into before is dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content in cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dry matter content is really important
to cassava breeders, to farmers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava roots are the harvested part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly starch and the dry matter
is what is actually cared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dry matter is a large component of
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used as a proxy for eating quality
and it's really important for farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: which factors into then variety adoption
as they want to grow crops that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to be consumed by consumers
and can be used for processing for eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem though is cassava dry
matter can be difficult to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two main ways that it's
normally measured through the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity method and the oven method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the right we have the specific
gravity method as measured last year in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of Paula's fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paula is another lab member of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this method takes, you take the roots
still in the field, take a subset of them
[SPEAKER_00]: from your plot, weigh them in air and then
in water and use a simple equation to
[SPEAKER_00]: translate that into dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other method is the oven method which
you take your samples back to the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: you peel your roots, you shred them,
you measure them before and after they go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the drying process and that's how
you get dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is though a third way that people
have started using and this is NIRS or
[SPEAKER_00]: near infrared spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is being used as, there's a
benchtop spectrometer that's being used at
[SPEAKER_00]: SEOT.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other organizations as well that
have jumped on board and it's been proven
[SPEAKER_00]: highly accurate, fast and also yeah,
it's just very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem though is you still have to
take all your samples back to the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: process them and then put them through the
spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is another version of this where
instead of being in the lab that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a handheld unit and so this is something
that Hugo out of Sean Luke's lab is
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring and he has shown that also that
method can have high accuracy but the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with these is the cost is
prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go into that, I'm going to
talk a little bit about what NIRS is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NIRS is this region of the
electromagnetic spectrum from 700 to 2500
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers and the reflectance as measured
by a spectrometer can be indicative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical composition of whatever you're
measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it changes the reflectance patterns
based on the carbon-hydrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen bonds,
total carbon and nitrogen so this chart
[SPEAKER_00]: shows some of the properties that can be
measured by NIRS and then this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: screenshot from one of the apps we're
working on that shows some variation
[SPEAKER_00]: between different routes for these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the cost is prohibitive for the
NIRS spectroscopy but it's a promising
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, we've been looking into lower
cost options to use NIRS in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found this device, it's called SIO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a smaller range than what's been
used in the past to measure dry matter
[SPEAKER_00]: content in Kusaba and so in order to move
forward with this technology, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with Hugo to subset his data from
his handheld NIRS that has high accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if this range is still accurate in
predicting dry matter using his developed
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that we've gone, we have reduced
the accuracy from 96.7% with holdout cross
[SPEAKER_00]: validation to 93.3 but 93.3 is still
pretty high for a tool that is a 200 times
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this each unit is about $300 instead of
tens of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at something that is
actually feasible for breeders to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: in their programs and could be really
useful in taking dry matter data quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field without having to transport
samples and also accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to then move forward with this
project, Paula and I set up a small pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment upstairs in the lab here using
roots from Wegmans and that you can see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture on the left here, we're just
practicing the protocol for scanning the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The device has a small plastic shield by
the actual spectrometer and that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put flush with the root slice which the
roots are already sliced to phenotype for
[SPEAKER_00]: different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So handy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just use the slices that are
already cut and scan them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked on the protocol and now
have moved into a pilot field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paula is currently in Uganda harvesting
her GWAS trial for softness and the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are already being phenotyped for specific
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as these disease traits that
require the slicing of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've hired an extra team member for
her to be able to scan the roots as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the phenotyping process and these same
roots are then being taken for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific gravity measurements and we also
have some of them going for the oven
[SPEAKER_00]: method just to round it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this harvest is taking place starting
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pictures are actually from last year
but this is the idea of what we're hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: will be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then after we get the data from
this pilot trial we will then be making
[SPEAKER_00]: some prediction models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking into using partially squares
regression which will reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensionality of the spectral data and
account for the multicollinearity between
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths and then we'll be doing some
cross validation and then hopefully some
[SPEAKER_00]: additional phenotyping for model
improvement with more measurements of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter and scans paired to be able to
predict better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately all this will be packaged
into an app for Android that will be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to join the rest of the Fino apps in this
suite of apps that are all free on Google
[SPEAKER_00]: Play for breeders to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that I would like to thank Paula
and Hugo especially for their help on my
[SPEAKER_00]: project as well as my committee Mike,
Rebecca, and Tim, the rest of the Gore
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, the Fino apps team, and NSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with those we really doubt there's a
lot of variation with those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did measure them using the drying oven
and there wasn't a ton of variation but
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the roots were actually
statistically different from each other in
[SPEAKER_00]: dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are waiting on a research license to
be able to look at the actual spectra to
[SPEAKER_00]: start our actual model development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know right now how that's
going to look but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we actually need a pilot
experiment to larger scale be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah so for this tool it has a little
cover on it that you can take off and then
[SPEAKER_00]: turn the device over put it back in the
cover and you press the button and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our protocol we're doing that
between plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a little bit overkill but
we'd rather have that than not have it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right if there are no more questions
let's thank Jenna one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
