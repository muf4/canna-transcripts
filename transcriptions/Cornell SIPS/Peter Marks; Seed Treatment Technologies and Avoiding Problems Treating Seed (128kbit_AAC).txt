[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we'll get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much again to the
Cornell Seed Conference Committee and to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, Alan, for inviting me to speak today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud and privileged to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very passionate about this particular
topic and have had the great fortune of
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to immerse myself from both
science and technical perspective in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area of seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to share a little bit with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My contact information, I'm sure this will
be shared down the road with anybody with
[SPEAKER_00]: the information from the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But feel free to reach out at any
particular time with any additional
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts or questions that come up from
this presentation or just a hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if that question we get them all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like to make sure that I certainly
can point in the right direction of what
[SPEAKER_00]: may be helpful for individuals with
questions around seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you an overview of what I'd
like to cover today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a broad topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we have a broad audience
attending the conference today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to focus on getting a
common ground baseline of what the coding
[SPEAKER_00]: world is all about and what these look
like from vegetables all the way to broad
[SPEAKER_00]: acre crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that is very clear and the
areas around these technologies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to spend some time
talking about the key features of coded
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the word coded to represent the
full range of seed technology that are
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll expand on that a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll then go into the types of coatings
used today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about those features that are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment that's used for these
coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally get into the heart of the
matter of seed treatment challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and solutions around some of these
particular scenarios that take place out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to set the stage in the morning
session, you would have heard from Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: and Alan would have spent quite a bit of
time talking about processing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: implications and selections and various
complexities around processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend our time today's book
speaking around this green shaded area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the treatment or selection of
multiple of various options and inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that companies can put onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, we're going to focus in
one area around coding and film coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coding in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world of palating and crusting
of film coding or seed treatment in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of areas that get
involved in this treatment sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: From enhancing, priming, steeping,
pre-germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on what type of seed you're
working with in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgrading in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to spend time about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are other inputs that are
into the treatment world that we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, which are the traditional
fungicides, the secocides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other products are applied to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are quite important for us to
discuss and understand if they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to seed in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along the way, we are very concerned
about quality and you'll hear this theme
[SPEAKER_00]: of quality throughout the conversation
today and the presentation as to a major
[SPEAKER_00]: concern that we will have and talk about
as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to set the stage, the family of
coatings, and I thought a descriptive and
[SPEAKER_00]: pictorial description of these families
are quite helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is onion seed that has been film
coated with a seed treatment on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the blue that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle is the black onion
seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left is a mini pellet or
encrusting white colored and the green on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right, which is also mini pelleted
encrusted version of a coating on that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally we get into pelleting of
that particular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have the full range of seed
technology for a species, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: onion, ranging from film coating through
mini pelleting and encrusting up to a full
[SPEAKER_00]: pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not every seed crop is utilized in
these technologies in the full gamut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetables tend to be more utilized in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bratica crops, corn, soybean,
traditionally tend to be just in the film
[SPEAKER_00]: coating seed treatment area of the family
of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a broad view of the
opportunities of applying seed technology
[SPEAKER_00]: to seed from a coating perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within these coatings, additions of
value can be added, particularly seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment and other beneficials can be
added to these coatings that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed handling is a very major input on
this area of seed coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking something that could be
irregular sized in shape and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might want to take small seed and build
it up in size to make it more marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are able to plant coated seed in
various machinery much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coatings improve flowability both in the
actual seed plant and in the planter box
[SPEAKER_00]: itself that growers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can increase the seed by weight to
improve air seeding by plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have a health and safety
factor around coated seed that it's around
[SPEAKER_00]: worker safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handling of the seed itself is quite
important in making sure that what we put
[SPEAKER_00]: on seed stays on seed and doesn't get
airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very large for certainly the vegetable
industry around coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a lot of coatings that go onto
seed, it wouldn't be possible to plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformly in these fields, namely
vegetables, direct seeded crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce comes to mind immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar beet, of course, is another one
that's used quite heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that crop a bit
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by space planting, we're able to take
care of the normal agronomic conveniences
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture, nutrients, sunlight,
availability for the plants to compete in
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less stress overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have less stress,
you tend to get better plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better plants tend to lead to be better
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, with the planting
perspective, we get a prescriptive seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to see prescriptive seed
treatments come into play by region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if we have hot spots for
nematocyte, nematodes, we can plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nematocides onto seed and we can have an
impact in a regional area that may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: such the case in other areas or parts of
the geographic planting territory that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be used to send crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really becomes prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing more and more of this as
we move forward in seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really like what we're seeing here
from the application of treatments onto
[SPEAKER_00]: seed as a prescriptive element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where companies and particular
professionals like to get involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages of coatings on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits, one of them comes
immediately to mind is branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to brand a color or a look or
some sort of effect around that seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: identifies the end user with that
treatment or with that application on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see quite a bit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the way it looks in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the way the seed appears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a lot of perspective from the
end user and perceptions of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an opportunity to do bolt-on
applications with these value additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have a seed treatment
platform, then you can have a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these can be bolted onto the seed
at various levels within the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: coating application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is becoming more and more popular
as you have these different opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy the bolt-ons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads into the differentiation by
the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allows us to do that very flexible from
the perception of having end users do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a downstream co-op that's
doing seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be very flexible about what
they're putting on seed based upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: region and the differentiation they're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other benefit is companies taking
non-saleable seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say they have a seed lot that's too
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to make it a little larger
to make it saleable so it plants better
[SPEAKER_00]: for the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you might employ some
interesting technology to be able to build
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed up and provide the benefit of
that particular coating or treatment on
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, future additions, we've talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows the platform to put those onto
seed with these coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a quality platform for the
end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives the right look and right
feel of what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these built-in benefits that are
provided by Coated Seed really do add up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end for the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start to move into quality,
and this is probably one of the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: areas within this subject matter that we
can spend a lot of time talking about each
[SPEAKER_00]: of these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, they fall into these major
categories, dust-off, flowability,
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, availability, seed safety,
build-up, and appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start off with dust-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust-off is a major concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we put onto seed, we want to
ensure that that is staying on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that being airborne during
the planting process or from a perception
[SPEAKER_00]: of having materials in the air when the
seed is being treated at the actual seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for worker safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these products to stay on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is technology to allow us to test
using a Hoybach dust meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a European machine that measures
the amount of dust coming off seed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Seed Union have employed this
technology to guide them in a guidance of
[SPEAKER_00]: what seed must meet in terms of a minimum
level of dust-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the North American market, we haven't
quite got there with a minimum required
[SPEAKER_00]: dust-off level, but we do tend to follow
the European lead with their standards
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have put forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Hoybach dust meter, not everybody has
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly a number of
third-party laboratories out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: SGS immediately comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer dust-off testing services,
and you can send seed in or have it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested, and they will certainly do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the large companies will have
these in their laboratories for testing
[SPEAKER_00]: products as a very common quality control
parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowability is really measuring in two
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have wet flow and dry flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet flow is coming straight out of the
treater.
[SPEAKER_00]: No curing, no drying, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply the product leaving the
treater and we measure flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the worst-case scenario of
how the seed will perform downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into a dry flowability where
the seed has been allowed to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either 24 hours after treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a sample and measure
flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is technology to measure
flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a picture in a little bit of
what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That falls into plantability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantability can be done using a plantar
test stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of companies that have
these for third-party testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also many companies have it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, testing the plantability of the
coated seed can ensure that we aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: causing any problems with the plant and
function of that particular seed species
[SPEAKER_00]: and the coating within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed safety, the number one thing is do no
harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we put on seed, no matter what it
is, from a film coat all the way up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: pellet, we must do no harm to the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early days of coatings,
there were times where harm was had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you from firsthand experiences
that those are not fun to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, when you have issues in the
field based upon a coating that did not
[SPEAKER_00]: perform as it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've learned over the years of what
best practice, application, technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: materials, all this experience has really
come into play where seed safety are basic
[SPEAKER_00]: table stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just are there as part of what's
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed is expected to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expected to germinate in a wide range
of environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should also be able to withstand
storage over time and have no harm done to
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well with any type of coating on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do some special enhancing like
priming, for instance, priming will over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, the lifespan or storage of that seed
will diminish over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say these things are
bulletproof, but we do need to be ensured
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're keeping up with storage as a
commercial saleable product for the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace and that we're doing no harm
in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next item is buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a buildup of coating material on
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's sticking and leaving a
residue and that buildup occurs over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of a treatment cycle, whether
that's all day long or for an hour or four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks if you're not cleaning down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a real troublesome problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This buildup can be really an issue
downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get flakes of coating coming off
during the transfer of seed from one
[SPEAKER_00]: location to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: These buildup flakes or coating chunks can
ultimately end up in the bag or the box or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever packaging material we're using
and that ultimately ends up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes major issues for the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got plugging of various planter
equipment and you get skips or you get
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and it just is a headache for
everybody and we just want to avoid those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things we can
prescriptively do to avoid buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then finally, least but not nearly a
bottom feeder here, this is appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appearance is really a quality effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old days, we were simply coloring
seed and trying to get some effort of
[SPEAKER_00]: color on there to meet the federal seed
act for seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays, appearances, we can make
these seeds look so glossy and flashy and
[SPEAKER_00]: really have a wonderful look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like pearls or candy
coated materials that we would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This appearance area has really come a
long, long ways and there's a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that can go into appearance to
try and spruce things up and give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: good look from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality, these are the key items that
we commonly focus in on these six main
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dust off to give you some perspective
of dust off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to try and put some numbers in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We traditionally measure dust off in grams
of dust per 100,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU has a level of 0.75 grams per
100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very small numbers and certainly
hard to understand if you're not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at them in comparison to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at actives alone,
they traditionally, if you're just putting
[SPEAKER_00]: an active on with no polymer, those
actives will have a higher dust off score
[SPEAKER_00]: than a seed treated with a polymer in a
traditional film coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to say all polymers are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see that we've got two
different polymers and two different dust
[SPEAKER_00]: results from those particular polymers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason this occurs is polymers
have what we call a binding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that binding capacity related to how
much it can hold onto the seed when it is
[SPEAKER_00]: cured and fully dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Film coats, we'll talk a little bit later,
create a fishnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there's a lot of
activity on the seed, binding on products
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that particular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can overstretch that and go too
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just simply won't have the
capability to hold onto those products
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond its binding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you're seeing that effect
here between what we call polymer A and
[SPEAKER_00]: polymer B with the same active loading
amount on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow meter you see on the right there
is a traditional flow meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can load in a kilo of seed,
set the gate to open for X number of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes or seconds or whatever you wish to
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the gate will pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure the flow and you can
examine what happens after that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: point of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is wheat looking at
flowability in minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, we want a lower number if
we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coatings can help in the flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improving the flowability over just
actives by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't to say actives are not
doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing what they're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many times actives, when they are
dried on seeds, they can create a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grit can cause some resistance
and flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put a coating on, it can smooth
that surface of the seed and get that flow
[SPEAKER_00]: moving a little quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw seed itself or naked seed,
that usually flows the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is usually considered the gold
standard of measuring flow is the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: raw seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowability, easy to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is technology out there and
equipment to use to measure flowability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get a very good sense of how
these particular products can perform from
[SPEAKER_00]: both a wet perspective and a dry
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wet seed flow right out of the treater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put it in the flow meter and
measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can wait 24 hours, measure the
same seed and look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see differences in those wet
and dry flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plantability, this is from a plantar test
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at singulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at skips, doubles,
placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of things you can do
across a variety of seed sizes and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is corn and using a John Deere
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for very consistent
singulation across all seed types in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular plantar stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're achieving that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot of great readouts from
plant monitors that are out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of companies have them for
their quality assurance testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, something we want to look at as
we're looking at coated seed to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not impacting these areas of
plantability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do no additional problems in
the plantability of a coated seed hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: the planter itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed safety, germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we all are very
concerned about from day one with any
[SPEAKER_00]: coating on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to always be looking at the
untreated seed against the actives and
[SPEAKER_00]: against the coatings that may be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this at times zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might spread this out at times three
months, six months, 12 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 months, two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those tests take actually two
years to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this real time environment of
seed being stored and running these tests
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we do no harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you're getting a snapshot
here in this graph of just a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time looking at untreated the actives,
an actus plus a polymer, and then an actus
[SPEAKER_00]: plus another polymer in the light blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really looking at the green and
the light blue effects of the coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you're looking at a warm germ
result, a cold germ result, and an
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated germ result.
[SPEAKER_00]: An aging result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three common tests that might be running
for corn in particular, maybe other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these will be run over a period of
time to ensure that we aren't doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: harm to the seed itself during that
storage period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite important that we have all
the controls in place to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure these and do them in a proper way
from the seed safety perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't underestimate the effect of seed
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've gone through quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at the family of coated
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a look at what's really in
front of us in terms of industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the two basic
industries, we're talking about broadacre
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the group up here on the left and
vegetables in the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all expecting the various
performance levels of quality within these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some very different
expectations and very different scenarios
[SPEAKER_00]: in real world with these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the vegetable industry,
there's small, small batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say small, small and relative to
what broadacre crops may experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally, seed value at the
vegetable industry has been much higher in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pound of tomato seed versus a pound
of corn seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different complete dichotomies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that, the vegetable industry has
had some very sophisticated equipment for
[SPEAKER_00]: handling these small batches from coatings
to upgrading to doing very specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: processes to that seed to allow things to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, in the seed treatment,
seed coating area, there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: advances of these areas and handling seed,
ensuring that the seed is treated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate idea of quality, measuring
moisture and humidity and processes after
[SPEAKER_00]: that coating process to ensure that the
seed is in its premier condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that is the broadacre crop
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we've had to, because of the large
volume of seed that we're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: there we've had to employ very large
capacity seed coating, seed treating
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many instances, there's just no way
around it because we have to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of seed through the system in order
to meet demands and the quantity of seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have in this area, within this space
of broadacre crops, we do have some very
[SPEAKER_00]: good seed treatment technology,
very high level, but a little lower level
[SPEAKER_00]: on the actual equipment side.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reverse that to the vegetable
side, you have a very high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment but a low level of seed
treatment sophistication from the products
[SPEAKER_00]: available for the vegetable industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just goes to the size of the
markets and where the value is placed in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of acres and the expenditure within
the large chemical companies and what
[SPEAKER_00]: products they bring to market place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a surprise to anybody,
but there are these two distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in terms of how these crops
are handled and what equipment is used
[SPEAKER_00]: within each sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of bleeding occurring
today of one into the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see more of the
vegetable side mentality entering into the
[SPEAKER_00]: broadacre crop side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see why that's occurring when we
start talking about issues and solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn how to handle various
applications in the vegetable side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's now starting to creep over into
the broadacre crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought this gives a pretty good
perspective of what we're up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really break down these coatings,
and we'll focus on this one in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: film coating, this is onion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the center picture here, you can see
that we have the onion seed itself and a
[SPEAKER_00]: red layer of the seed treatment and the
blue layer of the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can be layered on if we have the
ability to use multiple pumps or they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be all slurried on at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is just dependent upon what
technology the individual has for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the various crops that are
film coated, and here you're seeing some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of that pop up on your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some carrot and tomato and
various things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassica here on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into corn on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Film coating is used across almost all
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does a great job of encapsulating
the treatment onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seed size is still recognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still see what the seed actually
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So film coating versus seed treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we incorporate a polymer into the
slurry or into the application of the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment going on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust off is the result of reduction,
is the result of using that polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use a polymer, it's classified as
a film coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not using a polymer, as we did
many, many years ago, it was just seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much done in a cement
mixer or some other type of rotating
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just threw in the treatment and
whatever stuff is stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays with the advances of polymers
and slurries and active ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make a very nice package that goes
onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can apply it with that polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, a fishnet type
effect around the seed and allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the active ingredients on that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the vegetable industry,
one big difference that is very important
[SPEAKER_00]: to recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a drying step post film
coating or any type of coating,
[SPEAKER_00]: for that matter, on the vegetable side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That drying step has always been there in
the industry because of the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of managing humidity and
moisture within those particular seed
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Bratica crops, typically in the
past, no drying has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are instances where people are
employing that technology now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it typically has not been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're starting to see more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to make sure we pulled out
that little nugget to ensure you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that these differences occur
within vegetable and Bratica crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this shift of this
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this high level
sophistication in vegetables, low level
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa on the Bratica crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're being demanded to do more and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bratica crop sector is being asked to
put more onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a limitation of geography
space on the seed of what we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: put on and not cause ourselves problems
downstream at the treatment process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those certainly can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move into the next sector and diving
a little deeper in encrusting and
[SPEAKER_00]: pelleting, this has more traditionally
been used in the vegetable and protected
[SPEAKER_00]: glass culture industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking for singulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna be able to plant perfectly in the
field or in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seed counts and every seed has to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seed needs to be placed exactly
where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally this has all been very
much adapted by the vegetable or
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to bleed over a little bit
into some Bratica crops with this
[SPEAKER_00]: encrusting technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, it's been focused in this
area of the industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encrusting traditionally 10 to 30% build
up by weight depending upon seed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drying step post-encrusting is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're adding a lot of moisture to be
able to build that seed up by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed shape remains visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edges are smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can precise load on chemicals or other
value added products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust-off is minimalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seed handling, hopper books,
box flow advantages, and we have very
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So encrusting offers a lot of opportunity
for doing a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies on seed that pull us in a
direction that allows us these values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see some drilling equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photo on the right shows an
encrusted product on a seed wheel a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows you the precision that we're
going to get from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That vacuum is going to pull up each
individual seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put it down on the ground
exactly where we want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It avoids the whole issue of doubles and
skips and whatnot done by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pelleting, as we finish up the last of
the family of coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelleting is the roundest of all products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed shape is unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buildup by weight can go as much
as two to 80 times depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 80 is traditionally in small,
very small seeded crops like tobacco or
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very large builds that take
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a multiple of sizes of
coating or pellets within a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar beet comes in large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of the raw seed,
there's been a movement of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pellet type for each size of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been employed in that
particular market sector and areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within lettuce, there's opportunities for
a couple of different industry sizes of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce seed as well from the coated
pellet side in that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drying step is done here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to dry seed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to take out that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we get a good cure on
that pellet that's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to ensure that we don't have any
issues of the seed cracking or flaking or
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking off during that particular
process in the facility that's being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to load precisely chemicals
onto pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there is quite a bit of
layering that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability to load vast amounts
of seed treatment onto these areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: these coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can move them out the outside of
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows some good advantages to
target agronomic issues in the field by
[SPEAKER_00]: getting higher loads of seed treatments
onto pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make for a nice opportunity of
layering them away from the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them can be a little phytotoxic to
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by layering away, we can remove some
of those negative effects from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can add nutrients and other additives
to the coating materials to give benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: to the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, ease of planting is a stake
there involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And attractive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attractive products themselves allow for
us to have a multiple of color schemes
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be used, matte versus shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different
opportunities within the pelleting world
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do to give ourselves some
attractive looking products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you a perspective of what these
look like, and it's always nice to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some photos of this is sugar beet that you
see there and the blue pellets that have
[SPEAKER_00]: shown up on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar beet was one of the first crops to
be pelleted back in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: My former employer, Jermaine, started that
with a material supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole movement was to try and get
seed planting or space planting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field to get the crop of the sugar beet to
compete at a favorable ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sugar beet is certainly one of the
world's largest coated seeds from a
[SPEAKER_00]: polling perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get into brassicas and carrots
and celery, chicory, indigo, leek,
[SPEAKER_00]: onion, pepper, of course, lettuce,
mentioned before, tobacco, flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all used in this coating area as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, very, very small seed that takes
an extreme art and skill from the operator
[SPEAKER_00]: to coat these seeds almost like flecks of
pepper that are being coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can singulate one seed in a
pellet of the particular small seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the flower range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a range of raw and coated products
from your left to your right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your left, you have carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is fennel, and then onion,
and lettuce, and tomato, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you what flower that is,
but that's a flower seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite interesting to see what
these look like and how they migrate from
[SPEAKER_00]: the raw version to the pelleted version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then also have the ability to do unique
things within the pelleting range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying this is employed across all
crops, but certainly we're seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: also more into the grass coatings that are
taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass coatings are more of an encrusting,
but they're starting to utilize some
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies to manipulate inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some hygroscopic agents for
slowing inhibition where we're vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: to water damage in cold, wet conditions or
cold chill injury issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can slow the water from imbibing
into the seed quickly with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have hygroscopic coatings or
wetting agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is to speed the water uptake or
create some sort of a gel around the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the grass industry is
starting to show some improvements in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area of having seeds attract the water and
creating this sort of a gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some pictures here to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down the bottom in this petri dish is a
grass seed coated with a material that
[SPEAKER_00]: will form a gel when it gets wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gel is water activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine in some area locations
where the water is not predictable that
[SPEAKER_00]: this offers the opportunity for the seed
to experience some water that it normally
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these hygroscopic or wetting agents do
perform and do perform quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other area is splitting coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And split coat has been around as a trade
name for a number of years from a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Incotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, it was Royal Sluice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the split coat allows for the cracking
of the coat to open up and expose the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some phenomenons that take
place with light, a light seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement of seeds, namely lettuce,
in order to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural defense mechanism that
doesn't see light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we can employ the splitting
technology of the coat to allow the light
[SPEAKER_00]: to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will overcome that photodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the right how that split
basically just cuts right in half of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really does do remarkably well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of these products on
the marketplace today that allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapid melting or melting or disintegration
of the coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important for certain industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to draw this out that there are
these coatings available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of flower tobacco companies are
utilizing this technology because they
[SPEAKER_00]: want the seed to release immediately out
of this coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I click the mouse here, you're going to
see what happens to the coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the right the red pellets
starting to disintegrate as they
[SPEAKER_00]: experience some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here they are completely disintegrated
and completely gone within seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite amazing how these coatings
work in this area and allow for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe this opportunity in agronomics
for the seed to be exposed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the planting environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get these materials on seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of pieces of
equipment that are being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through some older
technology all the way up to what we use
[SPEAKER_00]: in a modern day seed treatment
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a spouted bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for film coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this works is we load a batch of seed
in this vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we fluidize the seed by pushing
dry air up through the bottom of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we inject, using a spray nozzle,
the seed treatment slurry binders and
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seed sort of tumbles and moves
around in this cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air is exhausted through the top
and captured and evaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of equipment is very early,
early day equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a film coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can immediately see that the batch
capacity would be limited and that your
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity per hour would be quite slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does do an effective job, or it does so
well as it dries during the coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get some layering if you
are so sophisticated with your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does provide a nice way of getting
that seed treatment onto the seed using a
[SPEAKER_00]: spouted bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next piece of equipment that's
utilized, and you still might find these
[SPEAKER_00]: today, is a side vented coating pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a technology taken straight
out of the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how tablets are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, is a batch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a spray boom arm that you see,
and I'll pull that up a little closer for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spray boom has multiple spray heads
on it where each individual spray head
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a different ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows for these materials to be
sprayed onto the seed and controlled,
[SPEAKER_00]: either all in one or one by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great flexibility for application of
materials onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other unique thing about this is
the drum rotates and the seed inside
[SPEAKER_00]: tumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the drum itself is perforated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we push drying air through the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually control the air in
terms of the amount of humidity that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: that air with these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does a very effective job of drying
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is batch to batch coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to load the seed in,
do the treatment application, but unload
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be fairly cumbersome to get a
good amount of throughput through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you still will find these in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equipment can be and is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling from the pharmaceutical industry
you can imagine that might be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more costly than some of today's seed
related equipment that's used for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next set of equipment, the film
coating seed treatment, high volume
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous treaters, these are very
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find a number of these out in the
field at various levels within seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, downstream dealers,
cooperatives, just as a matter of where
[SPEAKER_00]: you look, you'll find these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rotating drums, typically have
some sort of inlet on top that allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed to go through in a controlled
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much free flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throttle down the inlet a little
bit, but it does open wide up and just
[SPEAKER_00]: move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an atomizer that is atomizing the
liquids onto the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the seed enters into the rotating
drum and that drum is turning and that
[SPEAKER_00]: drum by turning allows the seed to rub up
against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by adhesion, cohesion, that treatment
is pulled on and off each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you're done getting
through the bottom of that drum,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've basically coated the entire seed
with a particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very, these are very common,
come in different lengths and different
[SPEAKER_00]: inlet mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even add dry powder applicators to
these units to apply powders to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're dealing with some issues of tack
or wanting to improve the appearance or
[SPEAKER_00]: shine, those powder feeders are employed
these days in a number of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit about some of
the pros and cons about that as we go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little deeper in the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, high volume, continuous
treaters here, which are looking at many
[SPEAKER_00]: different model leads exist in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propellating, it's really down to pan
coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we were for a number of years
and still use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pans really come from the confection
industry where we're coating nuts or seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with chocolates or any other type of
material or seasonings that go onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pan coating has really been around for
a number of years and we've adapted it to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for coating technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different sizes of pans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's round ones, what we call ball
pans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ball mills or cylinder types and
flat pans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different of geometric
shapes of these pans, but they essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the seed to cascade and then the
cascading effect where you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow seeds to be coated by the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this technology, more than any other
from the polling perspective, requires a
[SPEAKER_00]: skilled individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an art form as much as it is a
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these individuals that are doing this
type of work are very skilled,
[SPEAKER_00]: very seasoned and have a number of years
of experience in doing this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can automate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a number of companies that
have done that and the automation does
[SPEAKER_00]: work, but you have to have the right seed
species, the right materials to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult to automate coating like
tobacco or flowers, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really has to be done by skilled
operators with the right materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we end up with rotary coders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotary coders are batch treaters that we
see today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of seed companies have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a spinning disc on the bottom
that moves the seed terrifically around
[SPEAKER_00]: the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have an atomizer disc where
the liquids are put onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits behind a rotary coating is
that you can use this technology for
[SPEAKER_00]: encrusting and pelleting by adding powder
feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows for a lot of flexibility
from film coating, seed treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way through encrusting and
pelleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technology is widely adapted across a
vast number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say you could pellet tobacco in
here from starting from the raw seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to pellet or finish
tobacco seeds in here as they're pelleting
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certain seed species obviously
wouldn't be advisable to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly for a lot of vegetables,
all the way up to body of crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: widely adaptable piece of equipment to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little video to show here from a
graphical point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the seed entering here in this
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're injecting liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then powders are being injected to
coat onto the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the basic premise of this takes
place during a batch coder is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to control each of these inputs when
we want them and for how long we want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using batch coders, it's relatively
a fast process that's taking place in
[SPEAKER_00]: these drums because the seed is moving at
such rapid pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very quick application in a number
of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, high capacity output, continuous
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the batch drops in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We coat, we eject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next batch is already dropping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just keep going until we run out of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very highly, highly effective products and
technology in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of manufacturers that
make these equipments in different sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: from small lab size piece of equipment all
the way up to full size production units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll take a dive into seed treating
issues with the last 10 or so minutes we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here to talk about some of the issues
and some of the things that we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for when delivering quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a high pressure at all levels,
no matter if you're in vegetables or grape
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, we must deliver quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that quality starts with seed
treatment that's going on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to do with seed loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, what we put on the seed,
we want to ensure we have two things,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have bulk loading and seed to seed
loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all ties back to recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, whatever we're going to
put on in terms of the application rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed treatment, we want to ensure that
every single seed is getting what it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the exact dose rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could treat a batch of seeds and we
could have a sample of that seed and we
[SPEAKER_00]: could test it for its recovery or bulk
loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could come back just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just happen to sample the area that had
the amount of product on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we took another sample of that batch
where it did not get the correct amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: loading, our seed to seed loading would
show that difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to ensure when we are treating
seed that we have two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we have seed to seed loading,
but we also have bulk loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what sample we take,
we're ensuring that we're getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery of product on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of laboratories that
can do that testing, of recovery testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very common to do in
today's world from all different sectors
[SPEAKER_00]: within the agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Markets of seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand for better looking seed,
that is not stopped and it's continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got these perfectly looking
pearlescent seeds nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just equates to quality in
people's minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very high, high level of
requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get ourselves in trouble very
quickly by trying to achieve some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: looks if we aren't careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those can be disastrous and
some of them can be very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those disastrous ones are mainly due
to coverage issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the slurries that we're
utilizing, non-compatible products that
[SPEAKER_00]: fight against each other that we don't
seem to get the appropriate look we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that occurs very many times and that
we tend not to do our due diligence in
[SPEAKER_00]: working with coatings and recipes and
doing our testing to ensure that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The introduction of insecticides,
nematocides, biologics or biostimulants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all have an impact on appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each product has its own special
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each product has its own amount of
ingredients, whether it be active or
[SPEAKER_00]: inerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can help or detract from the
appearance of the final product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced from the particular seed
treatment plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, again, down to testing
that recipe and making sure that what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do is providing the appropriate look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's starting in the lab and then
scaling it up and then getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: production with it as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've mentioned many, many times about
the product prop challenge of how much can
[SPEAKER_00]: be loaded onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an issue because once we go too
far, we become too wet and we create all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of issues for us downstream that
relate not only to build up but appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have flow issues that occur as well
with this challenge of getting too much on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For vegetables, we've got that drying step
in there so it really doesn't become too
[SPEAKER_00]: much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can overdo it, of course, in the
treating equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that drying step, we tend to
alleviate most of those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: With vartica crops, we just don't have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we really
want to make sure we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a great example on the right-hand
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking down the barrel of a seed
treatment, a continuous treater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the chunks of material
that were pulled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's over a period of time that this
built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this build up was the cause of tack or
cure time, lack of, and over treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ultimately resolves itself as being
a calibration issue with pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was having too much material applied
during the seed treatment process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flakes were flaking off,
not this big a size, but smaller versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of this and getting into the downstream
product and into the bag product going
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big issue, big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit about how to
cure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So build up caused by tack, cure,
flakes, recoveries, all those issues are
[SPEAKER_00]: around build up, appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start having too much liquid or too
much product going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create these things called moon craters
or golf ball dimples.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a relation issue to coverage,
which flows over into the flowability,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be wet or dry and plantability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything relates back to ensuring
that our recipe is dialed in for our
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment that we're going to do or coding
that we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to accentuate any problems
downstream because they multiply and they
[SPEAKER_00]: become large like these seeds here in the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to tackle build up and tack,
we'll talk about drying and that drying
[SPEAKER_00]: can be imparted in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done with an actual dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be air time or some sort of curing
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of facilities on bread crops just
have a very small footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't put in a lot of equipment
around their seed treater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have no restrictions on
capacity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be energy efficient and be
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some new technologies that we
can impart in today's world to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate some air time, some drying
around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these photos you see here, there's
three different strategies being employed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the various opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see on the left is a rotary fluid
bed dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the big blue item, but the one on the
left, the gray item.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray unit is a rotary drum that has
air being going through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed rotates through it and moves
through at a very rapid pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rotary fluidization is very
effective of curing or drying the seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating not the buildup issues that we
can get downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying belts are another avenue of
utilizing drying technology to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup issues of such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluidized bed dryers, again another
opportunity to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of technologies now
coming through into the chronic air space
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow us to attack some of these
issues that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we've tried to solve them
with powders or drying powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are, while good to achieve maybe
the initial effect, the long range effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of that may not be so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that perspective, if you've been
in a facility that's using dry powders as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the treatment process,
they do come airborne, they get on
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, the floor becomes slick,
people can slip themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dust issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a whole host of things that
can happen with powders that go on seed as
[SPEAKER_00]: a drying aid and something that you want
to consider maybe trying to abate if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can by using technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize we can't all do that given the
certain footprints that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are avenues that are coming out
and other potential mechanisms to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air time, probably the biggest thing that
we can give ourselves when we're treating
[SPEAKER_00]: is air time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very common box-to-box seed
treater.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very rapid seed treatment
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a box of, a pro box of raw seed on
top of this unit, flip it on, the liquids
[SPEAKER_00]: are injected through the atomizer as the
seed is passing through the auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auger then moves them to seed,
treated seed into the next box.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, you can see that there's
very little air time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you try to impart too much seed
treatment and you have conditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity that don't line
up, you could end up with a pro box of
[SPEAKER_00]: treated seed that is very rigid and would
need some encouragement to flow out the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, again, air time is real
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we don't have that luxury,
other times we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, just to show you
graphically from a photo here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can imagine very limited air time,
just that nine or 10 foot length space of
[SPEAKER_00]: the auger, which actually there's a lot of
seed treatment happening in that auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is pushed up toward the discharge
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some adjustments to consider if you're
faced with issues and sort of the toolbox
[SPEAKER_00]: you might implore to try and deal with
some of the issues of appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And polymer is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are polymers today that have very
good shine elements to them and can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be mapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the perspective of a polymer,
this is where I would look to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the avenues that would be
first in the toolbox to pick up for
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water that's used in the
slurry, this is something that we commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: get asked or questioned about when people
are having trouble with the coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times by just reducing a
little bit of water in the overall slurry
[SPEAKER_00]: package, we can improve the coverage by
concentrating the actual liquids going on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be reversed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can need a little bit more water to
help the coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But traditionally it's taking a little bit
of water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to help coverage when we're
looking at appearance from a story
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atomizer and the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atomizer does have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people using certain types of
atomizers for liquids have a basket or
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of webbing on that atomizer to
help sling the liquids off the atomizer
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the seed mass passing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to find that a disk atomizer gives
us a better application onto seed due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that it's just a fact of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't clean the atomizer probably as
much as we ought to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the basket types over time,
we tend to clog the holes in the basket
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't get a good movement of
liquids off that basket into the seed mass
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's holes are plugged using a
flat disk with a slight edge to it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: us to have immediate success of getting
liquid onto seed and very minimal issues
[SPEAKER_00]: on cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finishing powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentioned them earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finishing powders themselves can aid in
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the downfall that finishing
powders may not stick to the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product and may become airborne or become
a dust off issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would cautiously look at this as an
area of improvement for appearance but
[SPEAKER_00]: they do work, work effectively and if
they're incorporated the right way with
[SPEAKER_00]: the right binding capacity of the
particular polymer, we can achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally the actual color itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color, there's many color
manufacturers out there in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are differences in color and
that just needs to be tested and evaluated
[SPEAKER_00]: in your recipes that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're having dust off issues,
I would go straight to the polymer,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that, of course look at the water
and the amount of slurry that's being used
[SPEAKER_00]: but the polymer is going to be the tool
that I'd be looking to here for dust off
[SPEAKER_00]: and making sure that we have the
appropriate binding capacity of that
[SPEAKER_00]: polymer to ensure that we are holding on
those seed treatment items onto seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack flowability and bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all boils down to an equipment
polymer and finishing powder area and this
[SPEAKER_00]: area is where the toolbox exists for you
to take a look at in terms of areas within
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility and where improvements can be
made from the equipment side, the drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the polymer side using a polymer that
reduces the amount of finishing powder or
[SPEAKER_00]: a polymer that improves flowability,
a polymer that cures faster, that reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: that tack time, that improves flowability
and lessened bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course if you're using a finishing
powder, making sure you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: right amount on and not overdoing it and
considering all the issues around that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally seed safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have issues around seed safety,
it's all around testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that we're doing the
appropriate test in the appropriate lab
[SPEAKER_00]: manner to ensure that what we're putting
on is done in advance of tests so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can be assured that we hit the facility
and the seed processing plant that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing no harm to the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the tools that I'd
pull out when looking at a problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: employing multiple strategies and it takes
multiple strategies to overcome problems
[SPEAKER_00]: in the facilities that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I think we're just about on
time for you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your great
presentation and overview of all these
[SPEAKER_02]: models of modern seed technology,
seed coding technologies and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, if you have a question,
just unmute and ask, or you could use the
[SPEAKER_02]: chat and type in your question there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you go to your last slide for that
CCA?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, those of you that want the CCA
credits, that is the information for you
[SPEAKER_02]: on the CCA credits.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Peter's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I want you to make sure if any
questions, a lot of information to
[SPEAKER_02]: assimilate and things like that to process
before they may be able to even ask a
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm taking notes as we're talking
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big subject matter, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to just congratulate Peter on a
great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of these topics, but from our
standpoint, a little bit more from the
[SPEAKER_01]: field crops or the broad acre crops,
as you're referring to, whereas Peter's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming some from the vegetable side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always interesting to see the
differences in the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say that I tend to look at the
vegetable crops, other specialty seeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out what's coming next, what's going
to hit us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fluidized bed dryers are showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the one surprising thing is I
see them often in soybean, maybe more than
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, certainly in cottonseed,
where they've got real high application
[SPEAKER_01]: rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the soybeans don't tend to soak up the
seed, the water as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't really like water that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you see things used that you
wouldn't expect would ever perhaps be
[SPEAKER_01]: economically viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's enough volume involved and
it can solve problems, sometimes it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a big hammer to make sure the
problem's taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am seeing some of the same trends
that you're showing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is Bob King.
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep hearing a lot about how weather
and the climatic change and all that have
[SPEAKER_04]: an impact or potentially could have an
impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: What type of impact could you see on these
technologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a real factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can imagine soybeans being
stored in silos outdoors under very cold
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and moving them into the seed
treatment process, there is an adjustment
[SPEAKER_00]: that's made for that during the seed
treatment process to ensure that recipe is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see later in the season when the beans
warm up and they enter the seed treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: process, that whole recipe changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the curing or the tacking that occurs,
that dynamic moves dramatically from that
[SPEAKER_00]: warming of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as our conditions change over the
treating season, we do see a difference of
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe adjustments to bean need to make,
bean have to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just with climate change and
what's occurring, we see more swings
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout that season than we have ever
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going to have to
employ different strategies throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season in order to overcome those
obstacles that we see from the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In controlled environments like a
vegetable processing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're dealing with seed in small
lots that are more environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled, we really don't see those
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Barthica crops, we're storing
vast amounts of seeds in basically
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions that are
different, almost ambient in cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are experiencing those differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be a ploy, a different
strategy throughout the year for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, this is Mike Migliazzo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you foresee an opportunity in the
polymer industry to tailor properties for
[SPEAKER_03]: polymers that have different film forming
characteristics to address some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: weather conditions that seeds are being
treated in any time between some people
[SPEAKER_03]: treating December, some treating May?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exactly right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing some asks around binding
capacity to adjust that binding capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: to match the environmental condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is we can't predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could run ourselves into a little
bit of an issue one way or the other on
[SPEAKER_00]: that knife edge of an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are small tweaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do within that polymer space to
allow us tweaks of the binding capacity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same product to give the same look,
but to change the overall dynamics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rheology of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
