[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the invitation to be
here today and for letting me choose my
[SPEAKER_00]: own topic to speak about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those of you who know me probably
know that for much of the past decade,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really worked mainly on irrigation
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: My students like to say that I'm a control
freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been controlling irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now want to control light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to control light in a smarter
way than what we have done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of my work was inspired by a book
that was published in 2011, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is full of vague claims, poor
understanding of plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it inspired a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite frankly, the book was written by
Dixon Despommier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not agree with the claims that he
makes, but I think we should thank him for
[SPEAKER_00]: putting controlled environment agriculture
on the forefront of the night of a
[SPEAKER_00]: national discussion about how we are going
to grow food in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think because he is incredible at
PR, there are lots of people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: really interested in vertical farms and
producing food in places where we may or
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be able to grow food efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has generated a lot of research
opportunities, if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people who are probably most
fascinated with vertical farms were
[SPEAKER_00]: architects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as soon as this book came out,
architects started making beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: designs for what vertical farms should
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually a lot of fun to just
Google images for vertical farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably don't work, but I would love
to see this building right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be cool to be able to visit
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope someone is going to invest in
that thing and make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: German engineers, not architects,
they took a slightly more pragmatic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to what it would take to actually
run a vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came up with this design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not nearly as pretty, but they did
all of the engineering to try to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what it would actually take to build a
large vertical farm and produce food year
[SPEAKER_00]: round in a facility like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this vertical farm has a footprint of
44 by 44 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 37 floors tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably over engineered the
building, since these are aerospace
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers, and they do like to over
engineer things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they looked then at how much does it
cost to build this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this building would be a little bit
over $300 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a substantial investor to be
able to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was more interested in is the
analysis that they did on what it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually run that facility on a year to
year basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that the power consumption
for this vertical farm would be 400,000
[SPEAKER_00]: kilowatt hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would cost about $32 to $35
million, these values here are in euros,
[SPEAKER_00]: a year to pay for the power for this
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this number probably doesn't mean a
whole lot to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 400,000 kilowatt hours a day is pretty
much, when you compare that to a
[SPEAKER_00]: household, a typical household is about 30
kilowatt hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that this number right
here is probably pretty close to the power
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of Africa, a city this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it takes to run this one
vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a tremendous amount of power
that you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of the cost of running these
things, 60%, is in power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their calculations showed that half of
this, 30% of total operating cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: was to run the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, much of the rest of the power use
would be for air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that air conditioning is
needed to remove the heat that you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get from the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in reality, the cost of running lights
is probably about 40% to 50% of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to run a facility like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research isn't just limited to vertical
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a small vertical
farm that is actually just outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlanta, close to the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: They locate it next to the airport because
they get naturally 800 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 there, apparently just from the
airplanes taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing how much CO2 that
generates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they typically use very little CO2
enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you can see here that they're
working with fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow these plants under amazingly low
light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, for them, the light is a big
cost for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In greenhouses, worst case scenario,
you may be spending up to about $500 a day
[SPEAKER_00]: on the power to run supplemental lighting
in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, too, when you add that up over
the course of a year, that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last week, I was in a 100 acre
greenhouse where they used supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the power bill is,
but they spend millions of dollars a year
[SPEAKER_00]: on electricity for their lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think that LEDs are the solution
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, are LEDs the solution
to solve these lighting issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, when people tell you that
LEDs don't generate heat, just laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start laughing right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that claim a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LEDs, good LEDs right now, I think,
are 30%, maybe 40% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that's the energy that gets
converted into light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that other energy is going to have
to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basic physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that other energy is heat that gets
generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between LEDs and most other
lights, though, that we normally use is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the LED light itself, you can get
really close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't generate a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the electronics on the backside of
the LED where the heat is generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that heat, you actually have to
remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't remove that, an LED will burn
up in a matter of probably milliseconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LEDs have been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two green lights show different kinds
of LEDs right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have really become more prevalent
in the last five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one reason that they have become so
much more common than they used to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, is that the efficiency of LEDs has
rapidly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a rapidly evolving technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, people may argue about
whether they are more efficient or equally
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient as the best high pressure sodium
lights that are out on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may not be much of a difference in
efficiency at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LED technology, since it is still
relatively new, is likely to become
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially more efficient than any
other light source we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it a good choice,
potentially, for supplemental lighting or
[SPEAKER_00]: for source source lighting, where you grow
plants in a completely enclosed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another advantage, in addition to the
efficiency, is that LEDs, if you use them
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, they can last a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that using them correctly is mainly
depending on making sure they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: more power than they should, because that
will quickly wear them out and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they are cooled appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned previously that the light
itself does not get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that you can have these
lights very close to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can even put them inside of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of Phillips light
bars, where they put them inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't burn the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a big difference compared to
the more traditional high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lights that we've always used.
[SPEAKER_00]: In greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of this is that this
actually allows you to get light into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom part of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use traditional high intensity
discharge lights, you would have your
[SPEAKER_00]: light somewhere above the canopy,
obviously, of the picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is going to be absorbed almost
entirely by the leaves in the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way to get a more even light
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should help overall canopy
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a drawback to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are still very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are continuously getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, the question of whether or
not it is actually cost effective to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace high intensity discharge lights
with LEDs is a pretty tough question to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get enough benefits from them to
make it worthwhile to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: replacements?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are still in many cases,
when I look at LED research, we are using
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs as if they are just a replacement for
traditional lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LEDs have much more capability than a
high pressure sodium or a metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them in pretty much any
spectrum that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I am most interested in is
controlling the light levels that we get
[SPEAKER_00]: from the LED lights and matching that
light level to the physiological ability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants to actually use that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that controlling LEDs is
actually very easy and very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not often that you have that
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investment is practically nothing if
you want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with LEDs, one thing that we can do is
we can very easily control the frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: at which they turn on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the standard dimmer that you may have
in this room or that you may have at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: a light dimmer, actually does the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns off the current to your light
bulb on and off at a high frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell that because it goes so fast
that our eyes cannot detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with LEDs, we can turn these lights on
and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, what we can do
then is we can control the duty cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is within one on-off
cycle, so this is off, on, and off again,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long are these LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are these LEDs actually on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example here, we have a 50%
duty cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically gives us effectively
half of the light output that you get from
[SPEAKER_00]: when the LEDs are on full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a medium light level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to a 10% duty cycle, the LEDs are
only on a small amount of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a much lower light level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then likewise, if you increase the
duty cycle, you get higher light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adjusting that duty cycle is really
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize this until I asked an
engineer if he could build a board for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, yes, I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll just have an undergrad put it
together for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, it is that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it is good to talk to
engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Lou here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I am focused on is what I want to
do is to optimize the light use efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through the physiology
of what actually happens to light when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are providing light to a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will get us to how we are
using that plant physiological background
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually control the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, what really needs to happen
in the light reactions of photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we have to make NADPH and ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't use light very efficiently
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It largely depends on how much light you
give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light you give a plant,
the less efficiently the plant is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: using that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way this works in the chloroplasts
is that light gets absorbed by chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what hopefully will happen is that
excitation energy from that photon is
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred from one chlorophyll to
another and ultimately to the reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: center of either photosystem 1 or
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, that energy from that photon is
used to move an electron from a donor to
[SPEAKER_00]: an acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a whole electron
transport chain that follows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this process is referred to as
photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we want to happen with the
light that is absorbed by leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, so this gives you a
better idea of the overall electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a photon that comes, in this case,
from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reaches the reaction center of
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then an electron goes from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is transported initially to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the rate limiting step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This turns out to be important for some of
the work that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets past this bottleneck,
then that electron moves ultimately to
[SPEAKER_00]: NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have reductant that gets
produced that can be used in the Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ultimately make carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, what is happening in
this process is that hydrogen actually
[SPEAKER_00]: moves from the stroma into the lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrogen is produced from the
splitting of water right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a pH gradient across this
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pH gradient is used right here to
make ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have NADPH and ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is ultimately the energy that is
going to drive the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, not all of the light that
is absorbed by a leaf is actually used for
[SPEAKER_00]: photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the light is actually going to be
converted into heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants have the ability to control how
much of that light gets converted into
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that control is actually based on that
pH gradient that develops across the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylocoid membrane inside of the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're moving hydrogens into the lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant can use all of this hydrogen to
make ATP, then we don't get much of a drop
[SPEAKER_00]: in pH right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the hydrogen transport across this
membrane is faster than the rate at which
[SPEAKER_00]: that hydrogen can be used to make ATP,
then we get a drop in pH right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that happens, that triggers an
enzymatic activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an enzyme called violazanthine
de-epoxidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets activated by low pH inside of the
lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violazanthine de-epoxidase converts
violazanthine, which is a xanthophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment that is present in the phylocoid
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It converts to antherazanthine and
subsequently to zeaxanthine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that conversion is reversible when the
pH increases again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that this conversion is
important is that violazanthine is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment that helps chloroplasts absorb
light and transfer that light to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When violazanthine gets converted into
antherazanthine or zeaxanthine,
[SPEAKER_00]: these two pigments actually act very
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two pigments cause the absorbed
light energy to be converted into heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an impact on the surrounding
chlorophyll molecules and prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll molecules from transferring
that energy from one chlorophyll molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, that energy now is lost as
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may seem like a bad thing,
but this is a way that plants can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves from excess light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a third potential fate
for absorbed light energy, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't seem to be something that is
actually actively controlled by plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot see it, but every plant that
is exposed to light is fluorescing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is giving off red light with a
wavelength of around 690 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually can see it if you get a green
laser pointer, and you point that at a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, you can see a reddish glow where you
hit that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually red photons coming from
that leaf after you give it only green
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chlorophyll fluorescence, it turns out,
is actually really easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very good techniques out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy the equipment, not necessarily
cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example here of a
chlorophyll fluorometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we measure chlorophyll fluorescence,
basically what we are measuring is how
[SPEAKER_00]: much light is emitted from that leaf at a
wavelength of around 695 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this light that is emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That photon is created inside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to measure that, we typically
measure the fluorescence coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf under ambient light conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this picture right here,
you can see a very bright spot right here
[SPEAKER_00]: where you also measure the chlorophyll
fluorescence when you give the leaf an
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light that completely saturates
all of the photo systems in that little
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those measurements, we can
actually calculate all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we can get a lot of
in-depth physiological information
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still always a bit dumbfounded when I
think about the biophysical processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can measure so easily by shining a
light onto a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take these measurements on a
leaf that has been in the dark for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, then you can measure something
called the maximum quantum yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that indicates whether that leaf is
healthy or not, whether photosystem 2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf has been damaged by heat,
excess light, salinity, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can detect whether or not there is
damage to photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a healthy leaf, you're typically
looking for a maximum quantum yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.82.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that value of 0.82 means is that
under those conditions, that leaf uses 82%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the light that it absorbs for
photochemistry, for electron transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the process that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: to get photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take these same measurements on a
leaf that is exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can measure the intrinsic
quantum yield in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is actually more interesting
because that actually tells us under,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, greenhouse conditions,
if you do this in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can measure how efficiently that plant
is using the light that it is getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: what fraction of light that is absorbed by
the leaf is actually used for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, in principle, is something that
we would like to be as high as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want plants to use light as efficiently
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know the quantum yield of
photosystem 2, the intrinsic quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, we can actually, so that's going to
be abbreviated as phi ps2, the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: of photosystem 2, we can calculate the
electron transport rate of photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know the efficiency with which
light is used, we can very easily measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of light that is getting to the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically make the assumption that
84% of the light that reaches a leaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be absorbed by that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a value that is roughly accurate
for a wide range of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we multiply that by 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is to account for the fact that
we have two photosystems and the
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption is that half of the light is
going to photosystem 2, half of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on that, we can calculate
the electron transport rate in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got all of that basically from
shining a light onto that leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring how much fluorescence is emitted
from that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last parameter that I want to talk
about that we can calculate is
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-photochemical quenching is an
indicator of the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanthophyll cycle, how much of the
absorbed light energy is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So non-photochemical quenching,
in principle, we would like to be low
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you get a lot of thermal
dissipation of light energy, that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that the efficiency of photosystem 2 is
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less light is actually being used for
photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is calculated from the
fluorescence that you measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under that saturated light pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal, we started on this about a
year and a half ago, was to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: biofeedback system to measure chlorophyll
fluorescence, then calculate the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate, and then adjust the duty
cycle of the LEDs to maintain whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rate we program into
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we started doing that,
we needed to understand just what these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were doing under LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had an LED light right here with a
power supply, a plant below it,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fluorometer for chlorophyll fluorescence
connected to a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data logger is controlling the
fluorometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells the fluorometer when to take a
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets the data from the fluorometer,
then, and a light sensor so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the electron transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just collected data under steady
state conditions, where we turned the LEDs
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of what it looks like
inside of the growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very early picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see the flickering nature
of the LEDs in that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was captured by the camera right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stripes that you see is actually the
result of how the camera shutter is
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our rather ugly control system
that runs the whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pretty, but it works most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we expose these plants,
this was with lattice for, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was 14 hours, I believe, to 400
micromoles of photosynthetic photon flux,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see over the course of that period
is that the electron transport rate
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the electron transport rate decreases
because the efficiency of photosystem 2
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It decreases over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the efficiency of photosystem 2
decreases because non-photochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: quenching is upregulated, as these plants
are exposed to these relatively high light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for lattice for a prolonged period.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I do want to point out,
though, is that the scales here,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at the magnitude of the
change, it's actually fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about a 5% change decrease in
electron transport rate, the same for the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of photosystem 2 decreases by
about 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And PQ, those values are just really
difficult to interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number itself doesn't mean a whole
lot, other than that a higher value
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates that more of the absorbed light
is being converted into heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, these plants were under 16 hours of
light, 8 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the relationship
between non-photochemical quenching and
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiency of photosystem 2,
you see that there is a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is very consistent with the idea
that the upregulation of the Xanthophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle is a mechanism that decreases the
efficiency of photosystem 2, but at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, helps to protect the plants
against damage from excess light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this system where we just had
LEDs and we could measure the plants below
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to adapt this system to actually
give us control and active control over
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the engineer that I mentioned
previously, he built us a duty cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency control board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control that from the data logger
by sending a voltage signal using an
[SPEAKER_00]: analog output module to the frequency
control board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the data logger can tell the LED
lines, basically, what duty cycle should
[SPEAKER_00]: you maintain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the frequency be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to talk about frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has turned out to be a really boring
aspect of everything that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had no impact whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the duty cycle, basically,
when we adjust the duty cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adjusting the light level that we
give to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, can we maintain a
steady electron transport rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually used a different lattice plan
this time, but we tried to maintain a
[SPEAKER_00]: stable electron transport rate of 70
micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is 70 micromoles of electrons that
move through one square meter of leaf in
[SPEAKER_00]: one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than the first few minutes,
we were actually able to control that
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rate, I thought,
very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very happy to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'll point out in a second,
it was amazingly easy to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rate of 70 micromoles,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tried different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a similar example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A similar graph with higher electron
transport rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more noisy, but overall,
we still have very nice control over the
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a way now that we can actually
control the rate of the light reactions of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis by simply adjusting the
duty cycles of the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the nice thing about fluorescence
measurements is that you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this showed how the efficiency of
photosystem 2 changed with an electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate set at 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the efficiency of photosystem 2 is
always the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no down regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that basically means is to
maintain an electron transport rate of 70
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the efficiency of the leaf doesn't
change, you're always maintaining the same
[SPEAKER_00]: light level, and you're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just turn the lights on,
walk away, and you're actually fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any active control needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was good to see is that in
the dark, before and after the trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got quantum yields of over 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that indicates that these leaves were
actually healthy and not damaged during
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out we can actually cause
severe damage to the leaves just by taking
[SPEAKER_00]: these measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I add the quantum yield of
photosystem 2 for the higher electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rates to this, first of all,
you see that the efficiency is lower when
[SPEAKER_00]: you have higher electron transport rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you give plants more light,
again, they use that light less
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a decrease in the quantum yield
of about 0.63 to maybe 0.58 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants at this higher light level
did become less and less efficient over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at non-photochemical
crunching.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see at the lower electron
transport rate is that non-photochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: crunching is very boring and always the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to higher electron transport
rates, we have more non-photochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: crunching than at lower electron transport
rates because we have more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we see that
non-photochemical crunching is upregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is inducing that xanthophyll
cycle activity to help protect itself from
[SPEAKER_00]: light damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, when we look at the
light levels that were needed to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: these electron transport rates,
so this is the light that we needed over
[SPEAKER_00]: this period to maintain an electron
transport rate of 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the biofeedback system that
we developed didn't have to make any
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light level of 240 micromoles per square
meter per second was just what these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the higher target electron transport
rate of 100, though, we see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: biofeedback system needed to upregulate
the duty cycle and the light level to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a stable rate of electron
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it showed us that the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exciting enough to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early days of this work,
the whole lab group would come sit around
[SPEAKER_00]: the lattice plant in the lab, and we would
just see what would happen next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: light we had hooked up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually really fascinating to
watch that plant basically adjusting the
[SPEAKER_00]: light to whatever level it needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also interested in seeing what
rates can we actually achieve with this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a biofeedback system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am only going to talk about lattice
because the other species, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: respond all that differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in looking at what
is the physiology that underlies the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal was to maintain the light in
the electron transport rate of lattice at
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels over the course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would increase the target electron
transport rate according to this dotted
[SPEAKER_00]: line that you see right here going from
initially 0 up to 70 micromoles per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter per second and then back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had each target electron
transport rate for only one hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were collecting chlorophyll
fluorescence data more often in the study
[SPEAKER_00]: to give the system enough time to measure
electron transport rate at a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: level and to make the needed adjustments
in the duty cycle of the LEDs to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain that electron transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we were measuring every two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the level of control that
we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually, I thought, looked pretty
good where we can maintain these different
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rates pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reached a limit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants simply couldn't do any more
than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going back down again,
we regained control of the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that you may notice here,
hopefully you didn't, this is where things
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum electron transport rate that
we got was only about 60 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed you in the previous studies
that we have no trouble maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport rates of up to 100
micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at the light levels that
were needed to achieve these electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rates, we see a stepwise pattern
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were maxing out the light that we could
get from the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that is interesting in this
is that we needed a lot more light to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a specific electron transport
rate during the first half of the trial
[SPEAKER_00]: than during the second half of the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these lines indicate the light
level needed to maintain an electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate right here of 10 micromoles
per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, we needed
almost twice as much light as we did
[SPEAKER_00]: during the beginning of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our initial thought was,
well, this is upregulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching in these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same difference here at an
electron transport rate of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difference in light level that
we needed at this point in time versus
[SPEAKER_00]: this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants were becoming less and
less efficient over the course of this
[SPEAKER_00]: 14-hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at the efficiency of
photosystem II or the quantum yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that during the initial part of
that trial, the quantum yield dropped,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we would expect as you
increase light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efficiency of photosystem II
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the efficiency did not really go up a
whole lot during the second half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial until we actually turned off the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the efficiency of photosystem II here
did not recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I took a closer look at these
data, another thing that I noticed was
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we look at the quantum yield,
this initial data right here, that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, these values are pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started about 0.72.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the efficiency of photosystem II
was decreasing during that initial hour in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually indicating that our
measurements as measuring chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence was changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efficiency of photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the trial,
when we measured the yield again here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark, we only got quantum yields of
around 0.6 at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that told us we are really damaging
these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this indicates a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have now narrowed that problem down
to the fact that we were simply measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that saturating light pulse that
has an intensity of around 6,000
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of light that is three times
of the maximum amount of light that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may get during the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exposing that leaf to that very high
light level every two minutes was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: causing damage to that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the changes in
non-photochemical quenching, we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching gets
upregulated as the light levels increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And non-photochemical quenching is
actually nicely downregulated again as we
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease light levels when we try to
maintain progressively lower electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So non-photochemical quenching could not
explain the difference that we saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: yield early in this trial versus late in
this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another way to look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solid symbols right here,
they indicate the relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching and the
measured quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this is in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield decreases as non-photochemical
quenching increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then during the second half of the
trial, as the light levels decrease,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching decreases
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yield doesn't increase the way you
would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I realized that this was
happening, we had a lab meeting to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a while to figure out what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we not see that yield recovering in
the afternoon, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching gets
downregulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took a look at the raw data
from the fluorescence measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the fluorescence that is
measured under the saturating light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an indicator of non-photochemical
quenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower this value, the more
non-photochemical quenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that stepwise pattern that is
associated with changes in the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate, changes in light level,
and a recovery again later in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next line, this is the fluorescence
signal that we measured on these leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: under ambient light conditions without the
saturating light pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw early in the day is that
that fluorescence increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is normal as light levels
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the second half of the day,
that fluorescence didn't decrease back
[SPEAKER_00]: down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fluorescence actually kept
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicates damage that we had
caused to photosystem II by trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure chlorophyll fluorescence more
frequently than these plants could handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that that damage happens is
through a process that is called
[SPEAKER_00]: photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under normal conditions, you have an
active photosystem II that is capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking an electron from water and moving
it on through the electron transport
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply too much light to plants,
photosystem II can actually become
[SPEAKER_00]: inactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually a really ingenious
mechanism through which this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have too much light,
basically what happens is that too many
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons get taken from a water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These electrons normally would be moving
through this electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't in this case because
there's so much light that there is not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That electron is going to react with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, what happens is that in
photosystem II, that excess energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually specifically directed towards a
protein that is called the D1 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: That protein gets damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant can then take that protein
out of the reaction center of photosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: II and put a new one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this takes a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a slow repair process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about how ingenious this is when
you think about this in the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're driving your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something goes wrong in the engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a smart engine that was as
smart as a plant, that engine would direct
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is going wrong in that engine to
your first spark plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that blow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you need to do to repair it is
replace that spark plug no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what plants have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They direct all of that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they direct that energy to the D1
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant essentially knows what
it needs to repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the D1 protein that needs to be
repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, plants have a very
efficient mechanism to repair that protein
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know that that is what is
going to be damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can reactivate photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this can be a matter of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we saw in our trials, we think,
we're pretty confident about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was induced by those light pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do know from these studies is
that we can control electron transport
[SPEAKER_00]: rate over a wide range of different
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it in many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't shown that here because it's not
really interesting to look at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs for different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do get high electron transport
rates, that is associated with a low yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and high non-photochemical quenching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also found that two frequent
measurements can result in
[SPEAKER_00]: photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do now is we measure that
fluorescence under saturating light only
[SPEAKER_00]: once every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing any damage from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing is that we can actually
see photoinhibition happening if we take a
[SPEAKER_00]: close enough look at the data because that
photoinhibition should be evident from an
[SPEAKER_00]: upward trend in the basal fluorescence
that you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was part of what we've been
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a biofeedback system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we understand the damage that
we get from the measurements, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be able to run this without causing
damage from the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're working on other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that LEDs have done is they
have actually generated a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: in McCree's action spectrum of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this curve right here shows how
efficiently plants use different
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths of photons for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's normalized to a peak of one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with LEDs, we can actually get very
specific wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot of interest right now
in trying to recreate the action spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if this holds up under LEDs and
see if it holds up under different light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because there is a lot of interest in
this, I'm not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is try to
convince you that this doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's much more thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be contrarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the efficiency is relatively
high in the blue and red part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum and we have good LEDs in those
wavelengths, efficient LEDs, the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light now has a mixture of red and
blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually using some of these exact
same lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has become the standard,
mixing red and blue, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Keith McCree and his
groundbreaking work in the 60s didn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about was even more
groundbreaking work that was done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50s by Emerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Emerson is largely credited for doing
the initial research that showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were actually two different photo
systems that worked together in electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Emerson did was he looked at
photosynthetic rates if we only get plants
[SPEAKER_00]: light with wavelengths greater than 680
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he found was that you get very
low photosynthetic rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with what we know now, that is
actually to be expected because photo
[SPEAKER_00]: system 2 can only use light with
wavelengths of 680 or below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, photo system 1 can use light up to
700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this kind of light, you're really
only stimulating photo system 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: not photo system 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Emerson also found, and I think we
have failed to really recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of this, is that if you give
plants light with wavelengths only below
[SPEAKER_00]: 680 nanometers, and that's this right
here, we also get low photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that light can still excite photo
system 2 and photo system 1 both.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still get only very low
photosynthetic rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we combine these two lights,
then you get this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get much, much higher photosynthetic
rates, much higher than the combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two lights when used individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a synergistic effect of light
below and light above 680 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind that is that I showed
this slide before, the rate limiting step
[SPEAKER_00]: in the electron transport chain is right
here, where this electron needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to a plastic canone right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will allow that electron to move
further down the electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often say that photo system 2 is the
rate limiting step for the light
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because photo system 2 right
here is not capable of donating this
[SPEAKER_00]: electron to the plastic canone pool right
here if most of that plastic canone pool
[SPEAKER_00]: has already been reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only so much plastic canone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on what Amazon found,
basically what we can do is if we excite
[SPEAKER_00]: photo system 1 more, what we can do is
re-oxidize all these downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediates in the electron transport
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can oxidize the plastic canones
right here, then they can accept another
[SPEAKER_00]: electron, and photo system 2 now is
capable of transferring that electron more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently, and electron transport can
occur at a higher rate, theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there goes the electron all the way to
NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told a graduate student of mine about
10 days ago, if she could get me
[SPEAKER_00]: convincing data on this by last Wednesday,
so she had about four days to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you go to the Light Symposium at
Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she got pretty motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she grabbed a red and blue LED bar that
has this spectrum right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some far-red LEDs sitting in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she added incrementally more far-red
light to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she measured photosynthetic
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she measured the quantum yield of
photo system 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the far-red LED right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds practically no photosynthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was virtually no light below 700
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when she did that, the y-axis here is
really confusing, because this data is so
[SPEAKER_00]: new that we haven't figured out yet how we
actually want to express this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this indicates the current that we
were giving to the far-red LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the intensity of the
far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from 0 with the far-red off to
more and more far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the far-red light turned off
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is indeed an increase in
photosynthesis that is disproportional to
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of light that we were adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now made the great discovery
that science done in the 50s was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we have forgotten about the
science from the 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the point I'm trying to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really worthwhile to look at some
key papers from a very long time ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is a lot of good information
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were also able to do,
what Emerson never could do, because he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have the equipment, we looked at
the quantum yield of photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually follows a very,
very similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the increase that we see in the
quantum yield of photosystem II is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not as big as the increase that
we see in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this by itself doesn't explain the
entire effect that we see on the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had any time to look at this in
more depth or to think about this a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got these graphs on Saturday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just interesting to go
back to that old literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a lot of interest in
McCree's action spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I say maybe it's not
all that important is that that action
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that McCree developed,
and it was great work, but it assumes that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these wavelengths are acting
independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from Emerson that for far-red
light has a synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes really difficult to
capture in an action spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might mean that you need to develop
an action spectrum with different amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of far-red light added to it or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is far-red light the only kind of
light that has this kind of an effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't possibly test all different
possibilities, all different wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: of light, because there would be hundreds
if not thousands of different wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can combine to try to figure out
what the most efficient combination
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did see that far-red light has a
synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, I thought, was worthwhile
revisiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does increase the quantum yield of
photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make photosystem II more
efficient, presumably because it helps to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-oxidize that plastic enone pool that
photosystem II needs to donate the
[SPEAKER_00]: electron to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, wavelengths do not have
independent effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we come up with an action
spectrum for photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our future goals is to try to
commercialize some of this biofeedback
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing that in collaboration with a
local startup company called
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytosynthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a company that was
started by two graduate students that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had in a photosynthesis class that I
taught eight or 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about some of these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked to their advisor about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a patent on the technology without
telling me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two students started two years ago
this company to try to get this technology
[SPEAKER_00]: to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm now working with Phytosynthetics
pretty closely to do all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we want to do is
to build a low-cost chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorometer that is done between
Phytosynthetics and an engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrument we use costs $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope we can build something for $300 or
$400.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make this a lot more appealing
to potential users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of the prototype of
the fluorometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the saturating light pulse
coming from a laser right here shining
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that in the next week or two,
they'll get me an updated version of this
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorometer that may actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, it's not easy to build a
chlorophyll fluorometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank Juanito Fararezi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the postdoc in my lab who built the
very first iteration of the biofeedback
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Weaver, who I subsequently hired to
work on this project and who will
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully become my PhD student soon,
did a lot of work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shuyang Zeng is a PhD student in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did the work revisiting the Emerson
effect and my current postdoc working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, Michael Martin, the whole lab crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to thank Dixon
Despommier for getting this topic on the
[SPEAKER_00]: radar because, again, I don't think that I
would have been able to get the funding I
[SPEAKER_00]: got if it hadn't been for his pie in the
sky, well, corn in the sky views.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may really disagree with what he
did, but I think he has done us a great
[SPEAKER_00]: favor in math.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were lighting at 24.7, if you knew
the level in intensity, you would not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily need a dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so if you light your plants 24.7,
you may have an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: non-photochemical quenching over time,
and you may be decreasing the quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may or may not happen,
but I would love to see data on that
[SPEAKER_00]: before I would make any hard claims about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not convinced that you would
necessarily maintain a stable electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate if you keep the plants in
the light all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plants don't tolerate it,
like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need their rest at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried growing lettuce on the
continuous light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lettuce is fine with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it would be easy enough to find out
if you have changes in quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so no, it is not a whole lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a 0.8 second pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to integrate that over the
two minute period, it's not a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a whole lot of light that the
leaf has to deal with all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, the leaf cannot do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at most a few percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so it's not really, every inch it out
doesn't take into account that all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: light is coming just in a very,
very brief burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is more than the leaf can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing that over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we tried to maintain an
electron transport rate of 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw a completely flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantum yield of photosystem 2 was
completely stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no evidence there of any kind
of circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at a higher electron transport rate,
we see that the quantum yield starts
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't seem to me like it's the
circadian rhythm that is involved.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants definitely adapt to different
light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shuyang Zhen has done work on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow plants under higher light
levels, they will actually be capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: achieving much higher electron transport
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are making more reaction centers to
help use all of that light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely acclimation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so you mean the LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LEDs are going on and off at a
frequency of 1,000 hertz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's no reason to do it at a
different frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it at a very high frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that it doesn't harm
LEDs at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tessa may be able to corroborate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing that already with a lot of
lighting that we are exposed to every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this lighting is being controlled
using the same pulse width modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other old research where people
were actually looking at how does the
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency of the light affect the
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of really bad science
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like there is no effect of
frequency to speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've tested that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really boring data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep the same integrated light level
and change the frequency, the plant does
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
