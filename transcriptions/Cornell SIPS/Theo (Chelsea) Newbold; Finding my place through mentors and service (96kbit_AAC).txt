[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone for joining.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PPPMB DEI committee is lucky today to
host Theo Neubold, a PhD student from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennsylvania State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their research focuses on the influence of
agricultural management on the composition
[SPEAKER_02]: of fungal endophytic communities in maize,
co-advised by doctors Sharifa Crandell and
[SPEAKER_02]: Gretchen Koldao.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a fellow of the prestigious
foundation for food and agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: research program and the first student to
work towards a dual title microbiome
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences and plant pathology PhD at Penn
State.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been spotlighted in numerous
outlets including a nature career feature
[SPEAKER_02]: article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Theo is the outgoing chair of the APS
diversity equity and inclusion committee
[SPEAKER_02]: and has worked for social justice causes
throughout the various institutions they
[SPEAKER_02]: have attended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through their background and service they
have been not only a personal inspiration
[SPEAKER_02]: to me but to many others I know in the
plant pathology community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's talk is a bit of a pivot from the
typical PPPMB seminars since instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing Theo's research we are
highlighting the humanity behind the work
[SPEAKER_02]: and showcasing the diverse lived
experiences of members of our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please welcome Theo Neubold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much Izzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am incredibly humbled by your
introduction and I want to apologize to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my greatest intention to be with
you in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner was injured and so everyone was
I really appreciate you being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: pivot and allow me the space on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Izzy said my name is Theo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a third year PhD student in the
department of plant pathology and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental microbiology at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a FAR fellow as she mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a microbiome dual title student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now typically when we come in to hear
research talks oftentimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation that's given to us is to
use a personal experience to bridge our
[SPEAKER_00]: audience with our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today instead I'm going to actually
use my research as a bridge to my journey
[SPEAKER_00]: and why I view the importance of this kind
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about and highlighting my mentors
and work in service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dissertation work largely looks at
understanding how agronomic factors shape
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar fungal endophyte community of
maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now classic definitions of endophytes
typically say that these are organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that live asymptomatically with implant
tissue and that they either have a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive or largely commensal relationship
with their host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this oftentimes ignores the cases or
situations in which parasitic organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize that tissue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for my definition I'm focusing on
organisms, specifically fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: that live asymptomatically within a host
for at least part of their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's obviously building on previous
definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really why do we care about
endophytes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well fundamentally we're really interested
in them for biocontrol and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in them in the context of their
of their pathogenicity and ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now traditionally when we think about
endophyte research specifically in maize
[SPEAKER_00]: we think about most work that's been done
in roots and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't surprising, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between nutrient uptake
and roots and yield or seed health are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be fundamental to our growers who
are most interested in the yield outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: of their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work also typically prioritizes
beneficial relationships without directly
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really haven't looked at what
factors drive these communities in an
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground or for my work foliar
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why we might think about this is in
relationships to pathogens and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these organisms colonize
foliar tissues and those can serve as
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum points for these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might also think about the relationship
between or the success of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: biological control agents in these systems
and the potential for existing microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities to shape the success of those
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thinking about the ways in which
climate change may reshape these
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and really focusing in on why
this work is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're looking at are a wide
variety of large categories of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers of these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know in a broad sense that these
drivers are going to be largely
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between abiotic and biotic
factors, things like environmental stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: anthropogenic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my work focuses on five main areas
looking at neighboring vegetation,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops, looking at anthropogenic
factors such as management style and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this work in the context of the
foliar environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf is a really unique plant organ
that's going to be continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing extremes, extreme cold or
heat, continuous UV radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: direct impact with those anthropogenic
factors throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this creates a very unique space
for colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my objectives, I have five main
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is to look at these communities
over the developmental time of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the planted seed and harvested
seed and how these communities change over
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then looking at cover crops, we know that
for both conventional management systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as organic systems, that the use
of cover crops is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really interested in how these
different legacies are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting these microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also thinking about very broadly the use
of organic versus conventional management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that these regimes vary and
they're really more of a scale between
[SPEAKER_00]: those two different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinking about how those different
practices shape these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, thinking about non-target
fungicide effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversation comes up a lot actually
in Pennsylvania where tar spot of corn is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to likely become a bigger issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers who may not have been applying
fungicides prior may start to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking about how those non-target
effects are going to shape these
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, thinking about stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to give you a quantifiable
measure of drought to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could walk out into a maize field here
in Pennsylvania in July or August and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drought has been a continuing ongoing
issue for the last couple of years and is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be exacerbated as climate change
impacts are felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just here where I am in Pennsylvania,
but also across the globe, places like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Global South.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about how these stress events,
specifically drought events, are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be shaping these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this to say that it's complex
factors that bring these fungal endophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: to their host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think very much in the context of
the agroecology space, in the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: the human or socio-ecology space,
and how our lived experiences bring us to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us today in this talk in some way
or form are in the context of academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got here, but had different unique
lived experiences that brought us to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of this as in the context
of intersectionality and the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiences and identities that we
bring into a space and how that shapes our
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say our research, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intersectionality comes from the field
of specifically Black feminism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word was first used by Crenshaw in
1989 to talk about the intersectional
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship of race, class, and gender
and how those specifically related to
[SPEAKER_00]: people's experiences with discrimination
and disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can think about it here as the
intersection of our identities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I have a very unique opportunity
to take you along on my journey and to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight the mentors that brought me to
where I am and my work in service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because humanizing people is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, especially in academic space,
it's very easy to dehumanize people,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when we're under a lot of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to push off the realities of
the world and focus in on a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need X or Y from a particular person and
they don't get that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we humanize people, we think
about their experiences, what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with on the day to day,
it makes it easier to empathize and to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a big part of what we're
doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come into this space and
recognize my identities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I realize I'm not there in person,
but one of those identities is that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white, effeminate person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things I'll share with
you today, you will perceive differently
[SPEAKER_00]: than if I was a person of color or male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of my identities is that I
come from poverty, which I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the knowledge that I come into the
space with is going to be different than
[SPEAKER_00]: some of you who may not have experienced
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also blind, which means I am entering
the space disabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also fat and I'm also transgender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are going to play heavily into
the experiences I've had and how I enter
[SPEAKER_00]: the space today.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about our lived experiences,
oftentimes, this imaginary goal that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to inspire people comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you, my goal is not to inspire
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the love of God, don't tell me I
inspired you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goals today really are really are
simplified here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first off is I want you to take
away this idea that mentorship is a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical element of success, whether
that's academic success or professional
[SPEAKER_00]: success, whether you're a brand new
graduate student or you're someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: been in the field for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentors are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to highlight the fact that
mentorship does not have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as simple as believing in
somebody, as trusting somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that prioritizing service and
community actually will enrich our
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate experience as well as our
professional careers overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also really want to focus on this
idea that authenticity is powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you show up in a space as your
authentic self, people see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who may share similar identities or
experiences to you, and they will feel
[SPEAKER_00]: seen and included as if they belong in
that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all stories, we're going to start at
the beginning in Huntsville, Alabama,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Rocket City, USA,
about until the age of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, this was a very small place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been there today, you know it
looks nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest things at the time were the
Huntsville Mall pictured here and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocket Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, it could be said that I lived
in a perfect white picket fence home and
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father was a computer engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother, a stay-at-home homemaker who
took care of me and my sister,
[SPEAKER_00]: cooked beautiful dinners and maintained
their iris beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a child, I can remember this picture up
here is our old home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be a pine tree in front and a pine
tree in back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember running through the grass
on a hot summer day and smelling the pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt so comforting and idyllic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like things that often appear idyllic,
they're often not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was five, about a year after
this cute picture of my sister and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken, my mother packed my sister and I
into a U-Haul with all of her belongings,
[SPEAKER_00]: less than $100 in her pocket and drove
across the United States to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, I grew up in Altadena.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting juxtaposition because
as you can see from the picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's beautiful with massive sloping
mountains, lots of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also famous for being in a lot of
movies, for being where famous
[SPEAKER_00]: cinematographers and artists live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a place of extreme poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in a largely redlined area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without resources, it meant that my
childhood was a little bit complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was further complicated by the
fact that while we lived with my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother at the time, who I am very
generously compared to for her strength
[SPEAKER_00]: and passion, she was dealing with a lot of
health problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is uncontrolled diabetes,
which made her incredibly abusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grew up in this environment where
we didn't have the resources necessary and
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse, which made my academic world fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It meant that school became a place to
escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also meant for me, at least this
lack of resources, that I struggled
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a blind student, who didn't have
updated glasses or didn't get to see my
[SPEAKER_00]: eye doctor frequently enough, I struggled
to read, to write, and to engage with the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I struggled and had poor
grades, my mother who had never gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: college made it very clear that I likely
would never go to college myself because
[SPEAKER_00]: she couldn't afford it and because you had
to be a straight A student to get
[SPEAKER_00]: scholarships.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't know that you could go into
life altering debt to get an education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, the accumulation of my
home life, my lack of resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my struggle in school meant that I
really didn't know I was there and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up until I got to my 11th year,
my second to last year of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just transferred from a local charter
school to the Blair I.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnet High School, another interesting
juxtaposition in my life, while
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously being a very
well-recognized institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also poorly funded, sat along a
freeway, and across the street from us was
[SPEAKER_00]: a power plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was a serious moment of change
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we had the initial meeting with all
of the teachers, we got our books and our
[SPEAKER_00]: class schedules, everyone milling around
the campus looking at all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs and things available to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's one of the far fences
there was a rickety brown table with huge
[SPEAKER_00]: three-poster display boards of people in
hospitals, people setting up beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in the medical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran over super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a unique opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, I want to be involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little old woman sitting at the
table, Ms. Deborah Hawks, who's pictured
[SPEAKER_00]: here, she saw my enthusiasm and made sure
I was able to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't just see my enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: She saw my enthusiasm as an initial
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: She saw it as my main driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: She cared more about my enthusiasm and
excitement throughout my entire program
[SPEAKER_00]: than she did my grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me every opportunity in a way
that no one else had, saw my potential in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way no one else had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, she helped get me my
first research experience when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 11th grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working with graduate students
from Caltech on what's very politely
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Solar Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge NSF grant to support research
experiences for high school students
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on sustainable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the project we worked on was
identifying alternative catalysts for
[SPEAKER_00]: solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did I feel seen in the lab,
seen in this space, my enthusiasm and
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities were beyond my grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the experience to not only do
research but also present that research at
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew at this point that I wanted to
go to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to pursue science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I participated in a
program that would have gotten me into a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was me and 40 other people
competing for that single spot in the Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: State University system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I didn't make it, I did get
accepted into university.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thought of going into debt even at
the time, which was only $20,000 a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: was so scary to me that I decided to go to
our local community college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who've gone to city
college or community college, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that oftentimes this is a extreme point in
our lives of positives, negatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was so much so that I really
wasn't sure if I wanted to continue with
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I finished in 2015,
I was ready to call it quits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was also really trying to escape
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you, there's no better
place to escape home than the coast of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied and got into California State
University, Monterey Bay, where I did my
[SPEAKER_00]: bachelor's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really where things changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my second to last spring semester,
I took a plant physiology class with the
[SPEAKER_00]: only guy on campus doing plant work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to work with Dr. Timothy Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was our professor for the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he saw, just like Ms. Hawks,
my enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My enthusiasm mattered more than my grades
in this space, the constant questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: excitement about the topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the semester,
when his undergrad graduated, he offered
[SPEAKER_00]: me the opportunity to come work in his
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funded research, mind you, to work in his
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the Undergraduate Research
Opportunity Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an incredible point in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work I did focused on comparing
molecular diagnostic tools and optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA extraction methods for phytophthora
cinnamomi and blueberry and avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I also got the opportunity to
present at a local symposium on campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any pictures because I was so
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Tim also sent me to my first American
Phytopathological Society meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2017, San Antonio, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even say the name of my
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just called it Momi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scared and excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met so many different people studying so
many different things that when I came
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Tim, I said, Tim, I have to be a
plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want to do with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tim goes, well, I guess you're going
to grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I didn't have a lot of context
for grad school, Tim's connection to the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar pathology world did bring me to
Oregon State University, where I worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: my master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked on my master's with Dr. Walt
Mahaffey.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to explore the fitness costs
associated with Stribular and Fungicide
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance and the great powdery mildew
pathogen, Aracyphina Cater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, what Walt Mahaffey and Walt
did was two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trusted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trusted me in a way no one else had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trusted me to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he trusted me to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there to pick me up when I failed
and there to push me when I succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trusted me to come in at 5 a.m.,
which, by the way, would not recommend,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get my research done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something else he also did,
aside from trust me, was that he always
[SPEAKER_00]: came into a space authentically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for him, it was largely because he
didn't know any other way to enter a
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was always 100% himself,
from cargo shorts and flip flops in winter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the appreciation for students with
nontraditional backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walt was something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his trust in me and his authenticity
really helped me see and express my
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this was exploring my gender
identity and using new pronouns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this was bringing my partner to
campus events and talking about my
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives and views and needs in the
context of social situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also got me involved in supporting
other students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of how you feel about
employee unions, they're a critical part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the graduate experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I so happened to serve not only an
executive counsel of our employee union,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Coalition of Graduate Employees at
Oregon State, but I also served as a
[SPEAKER_00]: liaison between our department and the
union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a transformative experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I also got the opportunity
to serve on several diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: equity, and inclusion committees within
the Department of Botany and Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathology at Oregon State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that time, one of the main things
that I did was rather than focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: equality, which at the time was the main
focus at the time, I brought in this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of equity, not only including that in the
name of our committee, but also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: language that we crafted in support of the
department's efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we think about equality,
typically this is everyone having exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example you can see in this picture,
we have three people watching a sporting
[SPEAKER_00]: event and each person has a single box.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one person at the end is already very
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the box, they can definitely see
the show or the game, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really need the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person at the other end is a lot
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the one box, they still
can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's equality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But equity is the redistribution of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this example, we see the giving
of the box from the person who's very tall
[SPEAKER_00]: to the person who's very short who can now
engage with that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I included language on equity as a
reminder, a reminder that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: actively be involved, actively
redistribute our resources to support
[SPEAKER_00]: underrepresented students coming into the
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: During my time at Oregon State,
I also had the deep privilege to meet Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branko Kesselstein, who was an alumni of
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, like me, was also blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me a lot of advice and
perspective on her experience in building
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and self-advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she also brought me into the
diversity, equity, and inclusion space on
[SPEAKER_00]: a much larger level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brianne saw my unique experiences as
valuable and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that people with diverse
experiences, like mine, need to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: positions of power and authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the opportunity came to
nominate, chair of the Diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: Equity, and Inclusion Committee at APS,
she nominated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was incredibly overwhelmed by this
opportunity, but everyone voted for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a transformative moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDI has become a home for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had many mentors and people that I've
worked with over my time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people ask us, why diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is diversity important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the answer from the website,
which talks about how diversity is an
[SPEAKER_00]: integral part of APS history and mission
and values as a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I think about diversity as an
integral thing to think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because when we're not centering
diversity, it's very easy to exclude
[SPEAKER_00]: people, whether intentionally or
otherwise, from the research space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And research is emboldened and
strengthened by the power of diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everyone thinks the same way,
we're never going to think outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great problems really of our
day is being able to address major plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without people with diverse
perspectives, we can't do that and the
[SPEAKER_00]: field doesn't move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's really why I care about
diversity in the context of APS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highlight some terminology as we
move forward, thinking about diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversity is the summation of
identities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People's sexual orientation, gender
expression, race, but all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: identities as well, such as citizenship
status.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inclusion is where all of these
experiences, all of these people have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place at the table and a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about inclusion,
one of the biggest, biggest parts of our
[SPEAKER_00]: work, like when I served with the
Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee
[SPEAKER_00]: within Oregon State's Plant Pathology
Department, and also within APS,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we're not just trying to bring people
in, we're trying to get them to stay,
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be inclusive, some ways that we
can foster retention are first by building
[SPEAKER_00]: trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not an exhaustive list by any
stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some examples of things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is building trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can build trust through being
transparent about expectations and
[SPEAKER_00]: policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the university system, we might think
about this as being really transparent
[SPEAKER_00]: about our expectations as advisors,
but also as advisees.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we plan or expect to get from the
people who are leading us?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might also think about this in the
context of APS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the APS meeting look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the expectations for people
coming into that space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being transparent, we actively
build trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also practice allyship,
and being an ally is not an identity that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can give yourself, it's an identity
that you are given for your work and
[SPEAKER_00]: practice of allyship for different
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we practice allyship,
this looks like using pronouns and chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, my pronouns are they and
them, my chosen name is Theo, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: my legal name is Chelsea, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actively being supportive by using
the correct name and pronouns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work to change spaces when,
issues of accessibility or safety are
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to our attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about this in the context of
the university system, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: genderqueer person who doesn't have access
to a gender neutral restroom, what are
[SPEAKER_00]: ways in which you can support access for
that person and for the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then listening to people is really
awesome, it's great, but if you listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: people and you don't respond, you don't
act on the things they tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes back to point one where you
don't actively build trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have to act when we listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then creating a culture of honesty and
critical self-evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Authenticity, as I said, is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being honest is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does honesty look like in this
particular context?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means, coming back to point one,
transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then critical self-evaluation isn't
just you as an individual person,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it might be your department,
it might be your college, it might even be
[SPEAKER_00]: your lab, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lab group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about critical self-evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CDEI really focuses on that
connection between diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, we actively provide training
and create developmental resources for
[SPEAKER_00]: people within APS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work to facilitate development of
social contact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interaction with people, this is really
important, especially coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key parts of the shutdown, thinking about
ways in which we can interact with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We act to promote communication and
interaction among members with diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of that inclusion
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really inclusion comes down at
the bottom, this enabling the integration
[SPEAKER_00]: of all underserved or underrepresented
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of the main goals of the
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to talk about sort of key
things that came about while I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with the committee from 2020 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I did, and this happened
around the same time I was working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oregon State folks, was this inclusion
of the word equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized when I was putting this
together, I couldn't remember the original
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the CDEI, but I think it was the
diversity and quality and inclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adding the word equity in there as a
call to us to remember to actively
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribute resources and promote
inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with our accessibility
subcommittee on crafting an article on
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was for ISMPMI, which I know has been
used in some of the courses here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then comprehensive recommendations for
APS on accessible meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for both in-person and online
meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big part of this is that we update
it every year and resubmit it to
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership as recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also work to include pronouns and
chosen names during annual event
[SPEAKER_00]: registration, as well as disclosure and
accessibility requests during
[SPEAKER_00]: registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accessibility request is a really big
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt really strongly about getting that
through largely because prior to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to open disclosure, people would
have to email somebody to ask for support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what this really ended up
resulting in is that the person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting emailed either lost the emails,
were too busy, and were trying to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with accessibility requests at the last
minute that often couldn't be put into
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people weren't being able to fully
engage with our meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also worked on developing the hub,
which is an APS diversity resource website
[SPEAKER_00]: through the APS website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really came about by work by Dr.
Dr. Maryama Carter, who headed the Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Lives Matter Task Force and put together
anti-racism resources with her task force
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2020 and 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does some of this work look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So annually, we have an LGBTQI networking
event at Plant Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also work to hold workshops,
such as our mentorship workshop in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we work to have panels,
both during the annual meetings and online
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll note that these last two we put
together, the beyond the land
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledgement, any envisioning
accessible science we put together,
[SPEAKER_00]: but due to exterminating circumstances,
really weren't able to come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really we're incredibly dedicated to
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even when we're not able to host
the events we plan, moving forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing that work is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about why someone might want to
take on leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's with the CDI or in the
context of any other APS committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to talk a bit about sort of
the outcomes or the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three that I really
thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about resume building.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things you can add to your CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also build leadership experience
oftentimes, especially as grad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get the opportunity to practice
leadership in this sort of capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this gives you a really large
platform for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then building your mentorship network.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some people that I met out of
this committee work who serve as both
[SPEAKER_00]: professional and academic and career
mentors to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am incredibly, I think this is an
incredible asset from my work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other ways in which you can be in
service can also look like being authentic
[SPEAKER_00]: and showing up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, this has looked like my work,
my specifically my ex or Twitter page,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I focus on highlighting my
identities, including a rainbow flag that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm disabled and queer as ways to show to
other people who might see this profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: who might also share those identities and
might be thinking about whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to stay in plant pathology or
stay in the sciences and where they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go, that there's space for them,
that they can take up space and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're wanted, wanted here in our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also being visible in your discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in more of a professional
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I use LinkedIn pretty heavily and
I share a lot of the more professional
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the work that I do or I'm involved
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, involvement recently with
the graduate women in STEM here and their
[SPEAKER_00]: empower conference and really highlighting
more the professional side of my identity
[SPEAKER_00]: in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also thinking about taking
opportunities to share our lived
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like like today with me, we coming in
and talking to you today, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: we're over Zoom, right, we recognizing
this is a very vulnerable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are also great opportunities to
show people that they're welcome in these
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other examples, I have a mini
profile, for example, with women in
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Izzy mentioned earlier,
yes, I was interviewed for for nature
[SPEAKER_00]: careers, talking about sizeism in the
scientific workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are great opportunities for
building visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one I want to touch on
very briefly is this breaking bonds of
[SPEAKER_00]: shared trauma in your profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ways in which I do this is promoting very
actively and prioritizing mental health
[SPEAKER_00]: with the undergrads I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're having bad mental health
days, I really don't want them in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to focus on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a strong line that we build
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I urge you, regardless of where you
are in your career, where you are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of your field, to think about ways
in which you break or build or reinforce
[SPEAKER_00]: those bonds of trauma in your profession,
because this can be a critical,
[SPEAKER_00]: critical part of how we retain people in
our fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, I'm actually taking a step
back from my work in social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when you spend a lot of time
talking, you don't actually get to spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about the LGBTQ, queer and trans
space that I take up, the current
[SPEAKER_00]: situation politically with what it looks
like to be trans in the United States and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fear that builds from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of this is really stepping
back and listening so that I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and do better work in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also focusing on exploring my needs
and exploring new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this looks like is I, back in
2021, I joined the Department of Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathology and Environmental Microbiology
here at Penn State with Gretchen Caldow
[SPEAKER_00]: and Schriefer Crandall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken more of an agroecological
research opportunity with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focusing more on family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see a picture of my partner
Michael and I, but really this also
[SPEAKER_00]: includes focusing on my mother who is
aging and dealing with health issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: really thinking about what it looks like
for me to be involved in her life while
[SPEAKER_00]: also doing grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also pursued the FAR Fellows program as
a major point in focusing less on academic
[SPEAKER_00]: career paths and more on industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten involved in alternative
leadership opportunities on campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as a graduate professional student
association, got involved in other
[SPEAKER_00]: professional societies such as the
Ecological Society of America,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have continued my union work with the
Coalition of Graduate Employees here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to very, very briefly,
and I can talk with the grad students
[SPEAKER_00]: about this later, mention the FAR Fellows
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard about it before,
it's through the Foundation for Food and
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of their many branches of
the work that they do, but it really
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on professional development and
career guidance for this next generation
[SPEAKER_00]: of agricultural and food scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it does is it provides
stipend as well as professional
[SPEAKER_00]: development funding and training and
formal mentorship support to graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students, specifically graduate students
who are really interested in non-academic
[SPEAKER_00]: track career paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk more about that later if
you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring it back to those initial
outcomes just to remind us that mentorship
[SPEAKER_00]: is a critical element of our success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a critical element of my success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe most of what I have to the mentors
who have opened open roads for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mentorship does not have to be
complicated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Walt just showed up as himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walt trusted me and that was enough to
give me strength and personal power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that prioritizing service and
community is an enriching part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: careers, whether it's graduate school or
professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that science is such
an important valuable thing to us as
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally to human beings that I want
to bring people in and keep them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's a big part of the
work that we all should be doing in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way in our career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the power of authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing up as yourself shows other people
that they can show up as themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a critical element to who we
are as people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to thank the people who fund me
in my graduate research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the labs that supported
me, provided feedback on my presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting me to where I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to remember and appreciate the mentors
who supported me in my path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more than happy to take questions and
I would love to connect with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to separate these QR codes out as
much as I possibly could so that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to scan them you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also my name, if you just Google me,
typically shows up on Google pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy to take any questions you
have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Theo, for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What questions do we have from the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you, yeah, just talk real loud,
probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Theo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your presentation resonated with me a lot
of different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask, I mean, I know it's like,
it's really important to focus on positive
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships and positive mentorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you talk a little bit about if there
have been any barriers to understanding in
[SPEAKER_03]: your lived experience and how you managed
to overcome it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think for, I don't know,
my lived experience, I have some invisible
[SPEAKER_03]: disabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of difficulty there with
allowing people to fully understand how
[SPEAKER_03]: things impact me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if you have any similar
sort of experiences and how you went
[SPEAKER_03]: through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of, for me, a big part is,
and I think I mentioned this early on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mary family didn't have a lot of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that was that I essentially didn't
know I was disabled until I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that I had struggled
academically because I didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I needed to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think often, especially for like
A-Fab folks who may get diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_00]: other, with invisible disabilities later
on, that could be a big part of it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about the resources we didn't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, it's really been about
discovering the resources that I need and
[SPEAKER_00]: making it very clear that those are what I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean I always get them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I may need support, I may need
like a support person to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's obviously may not be funding
to bring in a support person to drive me
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns to, you know, who in the lab
has time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does my husband have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can I find to have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I shift my research project
around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To meet the availability of people to
drive me to go do sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might also look like me doing like what
we could, I would say situational
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's close by readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do a lot of driving or
going to a bunch of different research
[SPEAKER_00]: sites largely because of my disability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also it's hard to explain to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say I'm blind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that blindness is a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am able to see and read a lot of
things that can't always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it ends up being about nuance and
how to communicate that nuance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often I can't and I end up just kind
of giving up and walking away because it
[SPEAKER_00]: feels weird to continuously have to like
validate my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sorry, I'm rambling at this
point, but that's that's what I can share
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other questions do we have from the
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say, I would say if you
could elaborate a little bit more on your
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts or recommendations as a DEI
advocate.
Inclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you talked a little bit about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question,
Izzy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I only heard the first first
quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, do you want to try to talk louder?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say I was going to
elaborate on your expectations for how
[SPEAKER_01]: disability inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around specifically disability inclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that is that the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, like I said, it's hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have for increasing inclusion in
academia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, like categorically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, like the one example that you gave
of including, you know, in registrations,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, do you have do you have
any like requests for things that you need
[SPEAKER_02]: and how that was a really, you know,
that was something you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really any other recommendations
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of my biggest recommendations
is actually at like a university level
[SPEAKER_00]: that is specifically around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you were talking about,
like, accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes we have offices, right,
whether that's a diversity inclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: office, whether that's the ADA office,
right, that are most of the work that they
[SPEAKER_00]: do is geared towards undergraduate
students and the work that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do is around graduate students
or post docs who may not fall under the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal like HR support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think first off, it's education
in those spaces around around what what's
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what are the resources that are
needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thinking about where the funding
and support from the university,
[SPEAKER_00]: what advocacy departments can do around
making sure that money is allocated to
[SPEAKER_00]: those resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that kind of what you were thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like I said, I'm having a really hard
time hearing hearing the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions from the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, it looks like I'm great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're within time in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 413 man, we now have the post seminar
lunch for grad students and postdocs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will meet you via Zoom in a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
