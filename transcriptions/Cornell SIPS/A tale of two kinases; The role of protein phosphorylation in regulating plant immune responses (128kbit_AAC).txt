[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: What my lab is interested in is the
interaction between bacterial pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm going to talk about two
different projects in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is focused on the role of plant
kinases in regulating plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is work on bacterial canker
of tomato, a disease that's caused by a
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem-limiting bacterium, and some of our
work understanding what regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial virulence in that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants have a variety of different
associations with microorganisms in nature
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this significantly shapes plant health
and productivity in these landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure we're all aware that there
are positive associations between
[SPEAKER_00]: different microorganisms and plants,
like that of nitrogen-fixing bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi that enable nutrient
acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're interested in, in my group,
are these negative associations or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens that can infect plants and
decrease crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work on some leaf pathogens like
Pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also working on vascular
pathogens that can infect tomato as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why I became
interested as a younger scientist in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology and decided to pursue that was
because plant pathogens can really
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly impact agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, there's always a lot of
very interesting plant diseases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously emerging, as well as really
important long-standing diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just illustrated a few here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So banana is particularly problematic for
plant disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's currently being affected by a
number of different fungal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: including microspirella figeensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because all banana that we eat
is clonally profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's propagated and derived from a single
clone called Cavendish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes breeding for resistance very
difficult, because there's no genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity there to draw from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, there's lots of
fungicide sprays that are sprayed aerially
[SPEAKER_00]: over banana plantations multiple times,
even within a week in a growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really important disease is citrus
greening, or huanlongbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a long-standing disease,
but it's emerged recently within the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's severely impacted citrus production
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been about $5 billion worth of
loss in the last five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's thought that almost all trees in
Florida are now infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transmitted by a psyllid,
and it's very hard to control a flying
[SPEAKER_00]: insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now know that the disease is
present in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The psyllid's established in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are diseased trees within the
Los Angeles area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we know that that's spreading
within the LA County area of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an important emerging
disease within the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also long-standing diseases that
still retain importance, like late blight
[SPEAKER_00]: of potato and tomato, caused by the
oomycete phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the importance of
genetic resistance, where you have one row
[SPEAKER_00]: of potato that possesses an immune
receptor that can recognize the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and another row that lacks the
corresponding immune receptor and is
[SPEAKER_00]: decimated by the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic resistance can be quite robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is that some immune receptors
can be rapidly overcome by the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also been quite a bit of
basic research on plant-microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions that have really
significantly enhanced our understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of genome engineering and editing in
plants, also hormone perception and
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor perception as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work on the plant innate immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants don't actually have adaptive
immunity like you and I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have specialized immune cells
that can circulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do have is a large number of
germline-encoded receptors that can
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically recognize all classes of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are receptors that are present on
the cell surface called pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition receptors that can
specifically recognize conserved microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: features called PAMPs or MAMPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of this would be bacterial
flagellin or fungal chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these surface localized receptors
recognize these microbial signatures as
[SPEAKER_00]: non-self, commonly function in conjunction
with a co-receptor, and then elicit
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern-triggered immune responses and
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogens need to be able to be adapted
to inhibit plant immune responses if they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be able to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way that pathogens can do this is
by delivery of pathogen proteins called
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors into plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these effectors, or characterized
effectors, can disrupt plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can target the receptors themselves
or downstream immune signaling components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these effectors can still be
recognized in certain plant genotypes by
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of plant resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call them NLRs, but basically a
resistance gene in an NLR can be
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called NLRs because they have a
nucleotide binding site and C-terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: leucine-rich repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these NLRs can recognize the presence
of pathogen effectors, trigger robust
[SPEAKER_00]: defense responses, and effect or trigger
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, it was thought that
these are two distinct branches of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: immune signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we know that it's kind of more of
a complicated web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is significant overlap in immune
signaling networks between PTI and ETI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plants also have large arsenals
of immune receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look in plant genomes and you're
just looking at these R proteins or NLRs
[SPEAKER_00]: that can recognize intracellular
effectors, they range on the low end of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 54 in papaya to the high end of
around 1,000 in domesticated apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the repertoire differs significantly,
even among different genotypes of a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also large numbers of
receptor-like kinases or receptor-like
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do control a range of processes,
but at least a subset are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in pathogen perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the model plant Arabidopsis,
there are 600 of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number is just increasing for NLRs
as well with the advent of RN-Seq to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify more NLR receptors in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my lab, we work on three different
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about two of them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One disease that we work on is called
bacterial speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by Pseudomonas syringae,
path of our tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can infect both tomato and
Arabidopsis and cause these necrotic
[SPEAKER_00]: specks during later stages of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the disease got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're primarily, I'll focus today on our
work with Pseudomonas syringae and
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other pathogen that we work on is
Clavibacter michiganensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this causes bacterial canker of
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the symptoms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called canker because during later
stages of disease, the bacteria will
[SPEAKER_00]: induce the stem to split open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is called a canker, where then
bacteria can ooze out and serve as a
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary source of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a lot of bacteria around
during flowering, you can get fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we're interested in,
we've performed some genome sequencing of
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of different Clavibacter
michiganensis isolates and used that for
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic testing, as well as to gain
insight into conserved virulence
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms present in Clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I won't talk about this project,
but I'd be happy to talk with anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working on citrus greening,
or huanlongbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're primarily interested in
investigating the role of secreted
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial proteins, called the factors,
and what their plant targets are during
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I'll talk about Pseudomonas
syringae and our work with Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at Pseudomonas syringae,
it can be divided into different
[SPEAKER_00]: pathovars, and each pathovar can cause a
distinct disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pseudomonas, in general, are pretty
good epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go out and sample the surface of
a plant leaf, you'll see that Pseudomonads
[SPEAKER_00]: are a core component of the phyllosphere
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pathogenic Pseudomonads need to gain
entry into the plant interior in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can do this by swimming through
open stomata, or wounds, where then they
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply in the epiplast, or the space
between mesophyll cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a susceptible genotype that
lacks corresponding immune receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get quite high bacterial titers
and invisible disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I want to talk about our work
focusing on how these intracellular NLR
[SPEAKER_00]: immune receptors are activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these NLR receptors have a conserved
domain architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have either a coil-coil or tear
domain at their N-terminus, a nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: binding site that could bind and hydrolyze
ATP, and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hypothesized at a resting state,
the receptor is tightly bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's bound to ADP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if a receptor directly recognizes
an effector, and there are cases of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens is you get exchange of ADP
for ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a switch for the active bound form
of the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's on an on state and can signal
downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also get ATP hydrolysis to
potentially recycle it back to an inactive
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: In indirect recognition, the model is
similar, except the effector is not
[SPEAKER_00]: directly recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, the NLR guards a host protein
that's targeted by the effector,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a mimic of a host protein that's
targeted by the effector, and when the
[SPEAKER_00]: effector targets and modifies this guarded
protein, this acts as a switch for
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other outputs of effector-triggered
immune responses in plants are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outputs of ETI are really,
if you're looking at resistance or
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility, it's more of a
quantitative phenotype than a qualitative
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, these are tobacco
plants that have the N gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizes a portion of the tobacco mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these resistant tobacco
plants, there's basically no viral
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation, but compared to susceptible
plants where you're looking at GFP,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the presence of the virus there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly in bacterial infection,
this Arabidopsis line has the RPM1
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant NLR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically see no symptoms after
inoculation, whereas susceptible genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: look very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the cellular level, a common
hallmark of effector-triggered immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses is programmed cell death at the
site of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant, if you look under the
microscope, will have patches of
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can do in the laboratory is go
in with a higher dose of pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can see macroscopic cell
death symptoms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work in my lab has focused on one key
plant protein called RIN4.
[SPEAKER_00]: RIN4 is conserved across land plants,
and it's been shown to be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: mediating immune responses in lettuce,
tomato, soybean, and also Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we know about RIN4 and
Arabidopsis from work in my lab and Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: Staskiewicz's lab, also Jeff Dangle's lab
and Dave Mackey's lab, is that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with several immune receptors,
and it's also targeted by a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different bacterial effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a resting state, RIN4 can associate
with the NLRRPM1 and RPS2, holds it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: inactive state to suppress
effector-triggered immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon delivery of the bacterial
effector AVRB, RIN4 gets phosphorylated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and RIN4 phosphorylation was hypothesized
to be a trigger to activate the RPM1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor leading to effector-triggered
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of indirect
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we tried and several other
laboratories tried quite hard to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRB was a kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the most simple explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were never able to detect kinase
activity for AVRB, so we thought there had
[SPEAKER_00]: to be another host kinase that might be
playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we used mass
spectrometry and immunoprecipitation to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull down the RIN4 and RPM1 complex upon
activation and upon delivery of AVRB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is a kinase called RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RIPK is a receptor-like cytoplasmic
kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could show in vitro that RIPK can
phosphorylate RIN4 at three sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mapped those sites by mass
spectrometry, threonine-21, serine-160,
[SPEAKER_00]: and threonine-166.
[SPEAKER_00]: And threonine-21 and threonine-166 were
conserved across RIN4 homologs in land
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some evidence to show to
indicate that threonine-166 would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical region based on where it was
within the RIN4 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generated a phospho-specific
antibody that would recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation of threonine-166.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can show that during natural
infection with Pseudomonas expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRB, you get RIN4 phosphorylation at
threonine-166.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total levels of RIN4 at this time point
don't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacterial effector is also
expressed and delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we used a genetic approach to,
determined the importance of RIN4
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation for activation of RPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we changed these phosphorylated
residues and mimicked phosphorylation by
[SPEAKER_00]: changing them to aspartic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we looked at the resulting
lines when we tried to complement RIN4,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we mimic RIN4 phosphorylation,
you see the plants are small, dwarf,
[SPEAKER_00]: their lesion mimics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a hallmark for constitutive
activation of immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if we cross these lines into a
genotype that no longer possessed the RPM1
[SPEAKER_00]: immune receptor, these plants looked
phenotypically normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using transient expression in
Nicosiana, we also determined what the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical residue was that's required for
recognition by RPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here if we co-express RPM1 with
various versions of RIN4, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: co-expressing with a phospho-mimic of
threonine-166 induces this macroscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: hypersensitive response, which is a
hallmark of effector-triggered responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look at RIN4, it doesn't
look like it's an enzyme of any kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it's conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a high predicted level of
intrinsic disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested the hypothesis that
potentially phosphorylation might change
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary structure or some aspect of
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see any change in growth
secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we phosphorylated RIN4
in the presence of RIPK using recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, then got rid of RIPK using
centrifugation, and then subjected either
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated here or unphosphorylated
RIN4 to CD spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here for wild-type RIN4,
you get a peak at low wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's consistent with this being
intrinsically disordered or random-coil
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a stronger negative elliptice
in the presence of phosphorylated RIN4,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that it's a more flexible
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see similar things if we're looking at
wild-type RIN4 or a phospho-mimetic mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: here by CD spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also searched for potentially
other players that could play a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: early recognition of RPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a collaboration between my
group and Jim and Xiao's group at Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they identified was a point
mutation in a cyclophiline that had
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced enzymatic activity, but
compromised RPM1-mediated recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyclophilines are cis-trans isomerases,
and they catalyze this for
[SPEAKER_00]: peptidallyl-prolyl bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a rate-limiting step during
protein folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we looked at this particular point
mutation within ROC1, and we performed
[SPEAKER_00]: disease assays using virulent bacteria,
here on the y-axis you can see bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: growth on a log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is days post-inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's not a difference
between wild-type Columbia and the ROC1
[SPEAKER_00]: point mutation or any null mutations
within NLR immune receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look, we could see a specific
effect after activation of RPM1 in
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you can see here is that
Columbia can recognize AVRB through the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of RPM1, so it has much lower
bacterial growth than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ROC1 point mutation was
compromised in RPM1 recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is the RPM1 null mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did some mapping of the
importance of proline residues across RIN4
[SPEAKER_00]: for activating RPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mutated every single proline residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, the graduate student that was
doing it, I said, don't do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to grossly mess up
the structure, and you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of results that aren't going to be
easy to interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was wrong, because there was only
one mutant that gave a phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was proline at position 149.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's good the students don't
listen to you and just go and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what we've done is we've taken a
peptide of RIN4 surrounding proline 149,
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled it, and then subjected that to NMR
spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that this is the general
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we add in unlabeled ROC1,
you're still only looking at RIN4,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can see is specific isomerization
here and here surrounding proline 149.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that indicates that in vitro,
ROC1 can isomerize RIN4 at position 149.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tested to see what's the
effect of this on the ability to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: RIN4 phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, if we look in plants,
at this ROC1 point mutation that has
[SPEAKER_00]: higher isomerization capability,
that after delivery of AVRB, we see much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower ability to induce RIN4
phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we delete proline 149 from RIN4,
we can see that at a basal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have much higher basal phosphorylation
of RIN4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our current model of our RPM1
activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that RPM1's at the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can associate at a resting state with
RIPK, RIN4, and ROC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RIN4 is isomerized by ROC1,
we predict, at a resting state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon delivery of AVRB, AVRB can dimerize
with RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: ROC1 disassociates.
[SPEAKER_00]: RIN4 is now in a cyst conformation at its
proline 149 residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enables stronger phosphorylation via
RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequently, we know that RIPK
and AVRB disassociate from the complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: but RIN4 and RPM1 stay at the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get activation of RPM1 and
induction of defense responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this association with ROC1 enforces the
inactive state prior to recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want really close control over
activation of plant immune responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's an energetic cost to
inducing immunity, and enforces actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the active state after recognition,
so you get robust immune responses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also done some work to try to
figure out why effectors would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: target RIN4 in the absence of RPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that there is a large
number of NLR immune receptors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NLR complement can vary
significantly depending on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypothesis was that in the absence
of RPM1, RIN4 phosphorylation would
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance bacterial virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be maybe one reason why
multiple effectors would target RIN4,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not going to be beneficial to
them if it's inducing immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to show that
RIN4-mediated phosphorylation inside
[SPEAKER_00]: mesophyll cells suppresses
pattern-triggered immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get lower extracellular ROS burst,
altered MAP kinase kinetics, and increased
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of non-adapted pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also able to show a number of
years ago on this PLAS Biology paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: RIN4 can associate with a plasma membrane
pump called AHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was is that
phosphorylated RIN4 could more strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with AHA and induces enhanced
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at plants that are
phospho-mimics for RIN4, what we see is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have wider basal stem model
apertures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that AVRB, when you
inoculate Pseudomonas syringae expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRB, it can also manipulate stem model
apertures upon surface inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to switch gears and talk
about another kinase that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on, and this is PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And PBL13 and RIPK are closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both members of these
receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is just a diagram of the
receptor-like kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these receptor-like
cytoplasmic kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their kinase domain is similar to the
RLKs, but they lack an extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of different
subfamilies within the RLCKs, and one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular subfamily called subfamily
seven has been demonstrated to be
[SPEAKER_00]: important in immunity in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is just the phylogeny of
subfamily seven and why we became
[SPEAKER_00]: interested initially in PBL13 is because
it's closely related to RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other members that have been intensely
studied in this area are also PBS5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: BIC1, and they all belong to the subfamily
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But PBL13 actually looks different than
these other RLCKs, and that's because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a unique amino acid repeat of 15 amino
acids that are repeated five times at its
[SPEAKER_00]: C-terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the RLCK looks very similar to
other RLCKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all of the catalytic subdomains
that you'd predict it would be an active
[SPEAKER_00]: kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a palmitylation motif at its
N-terminus, and we've shown that it can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the membrane as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a graduate student in the lab,
Dan Lin, was focused on the role of PBL13,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so he obtained two different TDA
insertion lines in PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's called PBL13-1, and the other one is
PBL13-2, which has a TDA insertion right
[SPEAKER_00]: before this amino acid repeat,
and it's a truncated allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is PBL13-2 that has a TDA
insertion closer to the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene and is a true knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that both TDA
insertions had identical disease
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, which indicates that this
C-terminus is important for PBL13
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is just phenotype after dip
inoculation with virulent pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Columbia is diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see yellowing here, whereas the TDA
insertion looks much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look either by dip or after
pressure infiltration, syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration, we can see that these TDA
insertion lines exhibit enhanced disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's bacterial growth on the Y-axis,
and you can see both of these have at
[SPEAKER_00]: least a log decrease in bacterial growth,
so it's pretty strong phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can complement this enhanced
resistance phenotype by adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like PBL13 is an active
kinase, and indeed when we performed in
[SPEAKER_00]: vitro kinase activity assays with radio
labeled P32, we can see that it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: active kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already knew RIP-K was a kinase,
so we used this as a positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: PBL13 can autophosphorylate and
transphosphorylate, a common kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we have this lysine mutant,
it's no longer an active kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also noticed is this is
recombinant protein from E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild-type PBL13 migrated abnormally large
based on SDS page gels, whereas the kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: dad variant ran at its predicted molecular
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that by treatment with SIP
that this is due to heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: autophosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tested the importance of
kinase activity for its resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, and we can see that PBL13's
kinase activity is actually functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: required, because you can't complement the
enhanced disease resistance phenotype by
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in a kinase dead variant of PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in what residues
within PBL13 are actually phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we subjected the protein to mass
spectrometry and mapped phosphorylated
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we could see is there are few
residues within the kinase domain that are
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the serine, serine and
threonine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the percentage of the
phosphopeptide distribution, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that the vast, this correlates to one
spectra and around three spectra
[SPEAKER_00]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vast majority of phosphorylated
residues are present within this repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it's a repeat region,
it was a little bit difficult to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: nail down unambiguously what particular
residues were phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a few different enzymes and we
could get some unambiguous spectra
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that likely this repeat of
threonine serine is phosphorylated on most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested now in why actually
PBL13 is more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesize it's a negative regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the plants, they don't
actually look phenotypically different
[SPEAKER_00]: than wild type Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have much higher levels of
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do think that it, and so there we
think it's actually, but we do think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a negative regulator because it has such a
strong enhanced disease resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that immune responses have to
be tightly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a trade-off between plant growth
and plant defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the timing and also the amplitude
of immune responses are tightly controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some common outputs of
plant immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at a few of them for PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is you get this reactive oxygen ROS
burst, this extracellular ROS burst upon
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by an NADPH oxidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extracellular ROS then serves as an
antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also lead to cell wall
reinforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then downstream of immune perception,
very early events also are this calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: influx, which is an important secondary
messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get activation of specific map
kinase cascades that lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional reprogramming in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at a few of these,
ROS and map kinase activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were able to show is that the
PBL13 knockout has enhanced map-induced
[SPEAKER_00]: ROS burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what we do to measure the ROS
burst is we use a luminol-based acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you can see the sum of the
relative light units on the y-axis and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the different genotypes on the
x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we add in a bacterial map called
LF18, what we see is that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid ROS production in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PBL13 knockout has higher ROS burst,
and this can be complemented by one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: PBL13 complementation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if we apply an immunogenic epitope
of bacterial flagellum, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia can respond to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PBL13 knockout has an enhanced
response, and this can be complemented in
[SPEAKER_00]: the complementation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we looked at was map kinase
activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here what we can see is that this
occurs between typically 10 and 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: after applying a recognized microbial
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at bacterial flagellum
22 application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a strong expression of
phosphorylated map kinases around 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes after treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see faster expression at 5 minutes
in the PBL13 knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just the flagellum
receptor mutant as a negative control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both of these are very early
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to occur around 10 minutes
after bacterial or pathogen perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ROS burst occurs, you know,
five to at least by five minutes after
[SPEAKER_00]: perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that this is going to be an
early response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in this ROS phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And previous work out of Jim Chao's lab as
well as Cyril Zipfel's lab had shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: a related kinase called BIC1 is involved
in phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase
[SPEAKER_00]: RBOHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RBOHD is responsible for producing
this extracellular ROS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces superoxide, which is then
rapidly dismutated into hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and can serve as an antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were able to show with BIC1
is after flagellum perception,
[SPEAKER_00]: BIC1 is able to associate with RBOHD,
phosphorylate it, and this act to prime
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent phosphorylation by
calcium-dependent protein kinases leading
[SPEAKER_00]: to enhanced activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because PBL13 had an opposite phenotype
as BIC1, we are interested in its
[SPEAKER_00]: association with RBOHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're using a split luciferase
assay where you can take one protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: fuse it to one half of luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another protein, fuse it to another half
of luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they associate, you can see
luminescence within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is transient expression in
Nicosiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see that PBL13 can
associate with RBOHD at a resting state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But opposite to BIC1, it rapidly
disassociates upon flagellum perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a negative control in
aquaporin that's also membrane localized
[SPEAKER_00]: to show that there's no signal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked for associations by split
luciferase or CoIP between primary immune
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't detect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our current model for PBL13
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also mention that we know
that PBL13 can phosphorylate RBOHD
[SPEAKER_00]: C-terminus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently mapping those sites by
mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that PBL13 has enhanced disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a higher Ross burst and faster map
kinase kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesize that it acts to
suppress defense responses in the absence
[SPEAKER_00]: of pathogen perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique among RLCKs because it has an
extended C-terminal domain that's heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated, at least in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in determining the
importance in vivo of PBL13 C-terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that it could compete with
BIC1 to regulate the extracellular Ross
[SPEAKER_00]: burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know there's different pools of
PBL13 within the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially one pool could be involved in
suppressing map kinase activation because
[SPEAKER_00]: we know Ross burst and map kinase
perception can be genetically uncoupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a pool of PBL13 that can also
associate with RBOHD, potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylating it at novel sites in order
to suppress activity in the absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the presence of pathogen perception
or elicitors, PBL13 disassociates,
[SPEAKER_00]: enabling BIC1 to come in and
phosphorylate, which then primes for
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent phosphorylation by
calcium-dependent protein kinases and an
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced Ross burst upon pathogen
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now I'm going to switch gears and
talk about the final project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at the interaction
between a gram-positive bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, clavibacter michiganensis,
subspecies michiganensis, and tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pathogen causes bacterial pancreas
of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just shown some disease symptoms
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It proliferates in the xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at an infected tomato
stem, you can see browning of the xylem
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also leaf symptoms where you can,
this is called leaf firing stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can get marginal leaflet
necrosis, which is a hallmark of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if there's a lot of bacteria
around flowering, during flowering you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get fruit symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called bird's eye spots because
there's a black spot surrounded by a white
[SPEAKER_00]: margin or halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also get infection of the
vasculature of the fruit by the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sources of inoculum are infected seeds,
infected tools, stakes, or transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria can also survive several
years on crop debris in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have this canker formation,
what happens is the bacteria then will
[SPEAKER_00]: ooze out, get bacterial streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the presence of water, they can
then move from one plant to another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can serve as a secondary source of
inoculum as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CMM has a high GC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's xylem limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's subjected to international quarantine
because it's particularly problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: within glass house, greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no genetic resistance in
commercial cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a few sources of
resistance that have been identified in
[SPEAKER_00]: wild tomato species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're primarily associated with
altered vascular morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have negative horticultural
attributes that are associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they haven't been successful in then
transferring those into cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, the control strategy is seed
disinfestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper sprays don't really work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the literature, there's one
completely finished reference genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: was published a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are interested in doing is
collecting a large number of CMM strains
[SPEAKER_00]: to represent the worldwide diversity and
then using phylogeny to sequence a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is just a map that's
highlighting the geographical distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different CMM strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected from six continents over
about six decades and then used phylogeny
[SPEAKER_00]: of five core housekeeping genes to try to
figure out which strains we really wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sequenced a number of different CMM
strains, 34 pathogenic strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then five saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're closely related clavibacter
strains that are non-pathogenic that are
[SPEAKER_00]: saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow a little bit within the
tomato, but they won't cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is problematic because then if a
grower wants to test to see if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial canker, these will light up with
any kind of currently based ELISA
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is problematic for disease
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if they detect that there's
actually clavibacter there, they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of all of their plants,
when it could be just saprophytic
[SPEAKER_00]: clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mentioned that CMM has a high GC
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at least 72%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a number of repetitive
elements within the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't get great assemblies just
based on Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a subset of these, we went in and
did pack biosequencing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, that worked quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to get completely finished
reference genomes and complete plasmid
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences just in a single shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll talk about from now is mainly
our work on the pack biosequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also sequenced, in this number of
34, some CMM strains that were collected
[SPEAKER_00]: within California as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011 and also 2015, what we had in
California was this vine decline disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically what we've found right now
is that it's a combination of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infection of the roots as well as
clavibacter infection, which combines to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a decrease in productivity during
later stages of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the tomatoes that are grown
in California are for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UC Davis is in Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they grow a lot of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've collected a number of isolates
just right around the university in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with farm advisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the San Joaquin Valley grows
quite a bit of tomatoes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we first looked at were the
plasmid complements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, they're saprophytic
clavactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can inoculate, but you don't see
disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants look healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the pathogenic strains that
we sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the reference genome that's
been studied the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reference genome has two plasmids,
PCM1 and PCM2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are required for disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can delete these from the genome or
cure them from the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria can still replicate, but they
don't cause wilting symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was there's a variation in
plasmid complement among the strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've sequenced, which is really similar
to what has been found for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that have come out of Cornell as
well around the Cornell area and in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have vary in their plasmid
complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the strains that we sequenced have
PCM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's variation in the presence of
PCM2 and or presence of other plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And saprophytes have neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCM1 or PCM2, but they have a novel
plasmid that we call PCM sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this circles plot of
the reference strain and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: California strains for PCM1, it's similar
for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that these lines here indicate
that there's homology and those genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high homology between other
strains and the reference strain with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to PCM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at bacterial growth,
PCM2 is not necessary because this
[SPEAKER_00]: California strain can grow quite well,
just as well as the reference strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I mentioned, the saprophytes
will grow a little bit, but not to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the genome to predict
secreted effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a gram positive bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't deliver effectors directly
into host cells, but it can secrete
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors outside of its own cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found when we were mining
for the secretome is that there's a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 40 effectors that are conserved
across pathogens and saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also around 10 that are only
found in all the pathogens that we looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a variable number of
effectors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at these conserved effectors,
most of them look like, at least that have
[SPEAKER_00]: a signed potential function, would be
degradative enzymes or secreted proteases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also looked at the presence of
genomic islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so bacteria can acquire DNA
horizontally, either through conjugation
[SPEAKER_00]: for plasmids, viral infection,
or through the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be detected based on their
deviation in GC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the genomic islands
present between saprophytes, pathogens in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, and pathogens in the reference
strain, we can see that most there's only
[SPEAKER_00]: one large genomic island that's present
both in the reference strain as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other strains that we sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other genomic islands are
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genomic island that's conserved is
called the CHP-TOMA pathogenicity cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just highlighted it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's quite conserved
across the reference strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the California strains,
and this is the saprophite where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been some work that's been done
on CHP-TOMA in clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if you delete the entire genomic
island, it abolishes pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you delete just CHPC, which is shown
here in yellow, this is a serine protease
[SPEAKER_00]: that's secreted that decreases virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we are interested in is what
about some degradative enzymes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you do get this canker formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maceration of the host tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the stem splitting open during
later stages of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the genome encodes
several putative degradative enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we focused on the importance of two
potential degradative enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: PELA-1 and PELA-2 that are conserved that
are pectate lyases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at PELA-1 and PELA-2,
they're predicted to be secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a central, and this is cleaved
then afterwards, they have a central
[SPEAKER_00]: pectate lyase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at crystallized pectate lyases,
we can generate high confidence models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really looks like a pectate lyase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The catalytic sites are conserved between
PELA-1, PELA-2, and characterized pectate
[SPEAKER_00]: lyases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we perform knockouts of either
PELA-1 or PELA-2, what we can see is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the PELA-1 deletion in clavibacter has
reduced symptom morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see this leaf firing stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the PELA-2 deletion doesn't really
affect bacterial virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a decrease in bacterial
growth, but it's not very robust here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be affecting symptom
morphology and not necessarily bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to go back in and look over
time and potentially look at movement
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at expression of
PELA-1 and PELA-2, if we look in rich
[SPEAKER_00]: media, both are expressed at a fairly low
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look and grow the bacteria in
xyla-mimicking media, minimal media,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see that PELA-1 is much stronger
expressed than PELA-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In PELA-1, the deletion is the one that
gives us a phenotype after we inoculate on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've also used these genome sequences
to try to develop diagnostic primers for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and industry to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we looked at our genome
sequences of pathogenic clavibacter,
[SPEAKER_00]: saprophytic clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also sequenced some genomes of a
related pathogen, subspecies sepidonicus
[SPEAKER_00]: that causes potato ring rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we designed about 10 different
PCR-based primers that should specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: detect pathogenic clavibacter,
but not saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found two that very robustly
amplify and looked quite specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is based on a sugar ABC transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is based on a transcriptional
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we provided these to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used them to now use for
diagnostics where they wouldn't detect
[SPEAKER_00]: these saprophytes or other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize, we've completely
finished genomes for about seven CMM
[SPEAKER_00]: strains using PacBio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used that to develop specific PCR primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know these strains are not clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variation in plasmid composition,
genomic islands, also in secretome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see there's about 10 core secreted
proteins from clavibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to investigate a subset of
these secreted proteins for their role in
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conserved PELA1, pectate lyase,
is important for bacterial symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But deletion of a clustered and closely
related pectate lyase, PELA2, has no
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be because it's not robustly
expressed during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to thank the people in the lab
that have done the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on RIN4 was initially started by Jun
Li, a previous postdoc in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's now faculty member at Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Denghuk Li, a graduate student,
has worked on that project as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on PBL13 was led by a former graduate
student, Dan Lin, as well as Denghuk Li.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then work on clavibacter has been
performed by a postdoc in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharipa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kost, Thomas, and Jessica have
also contributed to the RIN4 project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd like to thank my collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then funding for support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, PBL13 and RIPK are
closely related, but it seems like they
[SPEAKER_00]: have different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, are they functionally
redundant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, the reason why we were
interested in PBL13 is we thought that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be functionally redundant with RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to get more severe
phenotypes when we made higher order
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have double mutants of PBL13 and
RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't see that there is more of a
significant phenotype, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: with respect to activation of RPM1 or loss
of RPM1 activation than just the RIPK
[SPEAKER_00]: knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're actually doing
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look at the central region,
it looks very, very similar to RIPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're trying to do now is just
take PBL13 central region and see if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can complement the RIPK knockout just with
that as compared with full length.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's something that's going
on with the C-terminus that might
[SPEAKER_00]: determine specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing some kinase assays with
truncated PBL13 versus full length to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if that changes ability to phosphorylate
particular residues within target
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so RIPK is expressed strongly in the
root and also within the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more strongly in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a much higher expression than
PBL13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PBL13 is very lowly expressed in the
root as well as in the leaf and in
[SPEAKER_00]: senescent tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its expression level is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, it has no commercial value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, for citrus greening,
is it edible after infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the juicing industry for Florida,
they can do certain things to the juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: like add sugars, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will still enable them to
sell the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: During later stages of disease,
it's going to kill the citrus plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, obviously, yield will be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of the phenotypes for citrus
greening and why they called it citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: greening is that you get this inversion of
the ripening of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, it'll ripen at the bottom
first and then go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, when you have citrus
greening, you have green at the bottom and
[SPEAKER_00]: then ripening at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the pathogen proliferates in the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get more bitter fruit because
there's phloem blockage by callose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's decreased sugar
accumulation within the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to do some things for the
juicing industry for a fresh market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, if the PBL-13's
general function is to dampen rost,
[SPEAKER_00]: does the mutant have phenotypes in
addition to defense responses?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these RBOH mutants have altered
root morphology, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that PBL-13 is expressed in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't have the answer now,
but we're looking into it to see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: can phenocopy some of those mutant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, then I think that would
indicate that there may be additional
[SPEAKER_00]: functions for PBL-13 outside of just
defense responses.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
