[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for having me for the seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: From root to fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an apple rootstock reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been an apple rootstock reader now
for about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess when I started, I had very little
idea what apple rootstocks were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to kind of grow up and come to
an understanding of what they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks to the help of a couple other
people on our team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbal Winkle and Terrence Robinson,
who have been very supportive of the
[SPEAKER_01]: program in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here is Jim Cummings,
the many of the crosses that I still am
[SPEAKER_01]: working on were performed by Jim Cummings.
[SPEAKER_01]: He retired quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the rootstock team is at least
Sarah Bauer and Todd Halloran.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to remember Charlie,
who passed away a few years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the trees that we collect data
today were either planted by him,
[SPEAKER_01]: budded by him, or propagated by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to always recognize his
contribution to the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: My activity is called Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lead the apple rootstock reading
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a joint Cornell and ARS program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I advise graduate students, I participate
in committees, either local committees at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Geneva station, sort of committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I collaborate with Cornell
scientists and CC tech to advance the
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation of these new technologies
that we're developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also participate in some extension
activities and field days, talks and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth, as I'm asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my activities at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research work, however, on apple
rootstocks requires a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration than just what we are able
to do at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have collaborations with
Washington State, USC, ARS, in several
[SPEAKER_01]: different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the collaboration of the NC140
scientists that are all over the US and
[SPEAKER_01]: plus internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have field trials anywhere from South
Korea to South Africa and Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can imagine all apple growing
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of a historical perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have released quite a bit of germplasm
up to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of tells you a little bit
where I'm coming from and how breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: a crop that has a 15 to 20 year cycle in
terms of from the time you plant the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the time you have something that is a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little bit different approach
than something that you can cycle for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to acknowledge that in 1960,
that's the year I was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: And robustify was identified as a good
parent for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Cummins retired right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dr. Alwinco retired these past
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we released, since my joining the
group, we released several rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you'll see are having a major effect
in apple production now here in the US and
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figure that maybe this year we'll
have for rootstocks alone are finished
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a finished tree takes a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll probably have about three to
four million plants planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to increase every single
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, this is G41.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is G11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were numbers that were
calculated in early 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the newest numbers yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the projections are fairly good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means more plants that are resistant
to fire blight, more plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: replant tolerant are going into the hands
of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently attended or presented a seminar
in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a grower come back to me who was
a small, pick your own operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, without these rootstocks,
we would not be in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that put me back in perspective of how
important the work that we're doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you see some maybe 100,000 plants
just in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have propagation everywhere in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now also we have a nursery in New York
state that participate in propagation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we used to have some issues
with propagation because the rootstocks
[SPEAKER_01]: were selected for performance in the field
and not as much for performance in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stool beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see here, this is
propagation by cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, someone had the idea,
well, let's do cuttings out of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of years later, 800,000
plants come out every season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm proud of the nursery industry and
how much they have adopted our material
[SPEAKER_01]: and being able to work with it and work
with the kinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a nutshell, biggest words,
rootstocks, apple, and breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our apples are not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Susan Brown teases me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good thing is that I can make her
apple trees produce better and higher
[SPEAKER_01]: quality apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how apple production was about
100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ladders and everybody had to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring the whole family and you have
sometimes people just falling off the
[SPEAKER_01]: ladder sometimes and carrying big bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the way it is nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, the apples are placed very
tightly and very neatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They calculate how much a single branch
can hold or how many apples a single
[SPEAKER_01]: branch can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they thin to that amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty impressive to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would not have been possible
without the dwarfing effect that apple
[SPEAKER_01]: rootstocks confer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see this transition from big trees
to here's a big tree that doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: dwarfing genes and a small tree that has
the dwarfing gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the effect also in fruit
density per square centimeter of trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made this possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which meant less ladder accidents,
more ergonomics for picking, increased
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured that the productivity went up
about, in current money, half a billion to
[SPEAKER_01]: $750 million in the US just based on the
dwarfing effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a while back we figured out what the
dwarfing effect was caused by in our
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some quantitative genetics and we
identified the additional locus that
[SPEAKER_01]: causes the dwarfing effect and also
related it to the induction of early
[SPEAKER_01]: bearing in apple science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short,
[SPEAKER_01]: the evaluations here spanned about I would
say seven to nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for a quick paper,
sorry this apple rootstocks are not what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long story short, there are two loci.
[SPEAKER_01]: That interact with each other and they
affect the size of the tree as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only certain combinations of alleles
give the highest production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nowadays I can go into a marker
assisted selection scheme and select for a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain combination of alleles and predict
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can selectively develop rootstocks that
can produce higher, more apples and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain size of tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of our arsenal that we developed in
this process was a set of EQTLs that
[SPEAKER_01]: segregated in one of our big population,
one of the main populations that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: EQTL stands for expression QTL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use the QTLs in this, the EQTLs as
additional tools to develop markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look for EQTLs whose apple type is
in cis configuration with the trait that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it be yield or tree size or disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we find the polymorphism that is
contained in that gene and we harness it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a little slide to show you a
little bit what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have here powdery mildew resistance
that's segregating in that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then several genes that are kind of
associated with that resistance in that
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take those genes and
essentially transform them into markers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are mapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of look like this when we're
done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We utilize any kind of polymorphism that
we can get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SNPs or indels, indels are very nice
because you can create nice PCR primers
[SPEAKER_01]: that amplify or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been very useful in our
breeding program in reducing the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that has to go in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question comes to me then,
we're developing these rootstocks and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will eventually end up in the hands of
apple growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apple growers or orchards are an
interesting place because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the rootstocks interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have interactions with the soil,
the pH type, structure, content,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an interaction with cyan variety
that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate, temperature, amount of water
that's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diseases and insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we have I think
perhaps the most important interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is with humans, management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can vouch for the fact that a
rootstock under different management is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to react quite differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And produce a different product in the
orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough to breed for orchard
management, but we can try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these interactions, we're hoping that
our selection scheme is good enough to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to account for the variability we see
in our rootstocks and select for the best
[SPEAKER_01]: performer ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does a root system do in the orchard
where it modifies tree architecture?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an interface with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So root penetration, anchorage,
soil chemistry, pH, soil microbes competes
[SPEAKER_01]: with our roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It collects nutrients and water that then
it sends up to the cyan and it fights
[SPEAKER_01]: infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It survives in certain climates or thrives
in other climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you improve rootstock
functions, you end up improving the
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity of the tree as well as I
think the quality of the apples that are
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested from that tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is more of a general thought that
doesn't apply just to apple rootstocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can apply to any other tree crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or vegetable crop that uses rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big push with tomatoes and
rootstocks and other crops, vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that are using rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these, improving all of these
functions through breeding can improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall yield of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years back, we did a study with
apple rootstocks that looked at how
[SPEAKER_01]: rootstocks were regulating gene expression
in the cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we had the question, do they
regulate gene expression?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense that they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what does a rootstock modify in
the cyan?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found out that in effect,
dwarfing rootstocks had different
[SPEAKER_01]: potentials to change the expression of
certain genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cyan, dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that knowledge was important because
it went back to how the rootstocks may
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the fruit and the production of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have signals that go up and they
may be of many different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you have ethylene, but auxin types,
gibberellins, water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water status is a big signal to the cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then individual nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are more and more things that
the root systems can do to affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided that we would look at
something that was sort of easy to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that would take one of these elements
and specifically the changes in nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to look at what does,
if number one, rootstocks had an effect or
[SPEAKER_01]: the different germplasm had an effect on
the same cyan to see if it would modify
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentration of certain nutrients in
the cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we wanted to look at how these
rootstocks performed in different soil
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pH, water, soil-borne diseases,
and soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also wanted to see, I wanted to see if
I could mitigate fruit disorders that are
[SPEAKER_01]: caused sometimes by the lack of or the
overabundance of certain nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cal, there's a very strong correlation
between calcium and bitter pit and
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycrisp and other apples that develop
bitter pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a breeding standpoint,
the question was can I select for
[SPEAKER_01]: increased calcium availability to the cyan
so that we mitigate that problem that
[SPEAKER_01]: appears in storage facilities around the
US and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, the possibility to improve on
fertilizer applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we could apply 30% less phosphorus
or nitrogen to the same planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining the same yield in the orchard?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would, can we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is going back to biology or
root biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, okay, how are we gonna study
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course in apple rootstocks,
it makes sense that they may possess
[SPEAKER_01]: different channels for different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it goes into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the root hair and then the
nutrients go back up and you have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cyan into the apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have so many things going on that
influence that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking earlier and mentioning
that, okay, when you have a certain amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of a system that is so complex,
you kind of have to use the black box
[SPEAKER_01]: approach, which is to find out what
happens at the end of the tunnel,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the experiments that I'm going
to show, the results that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: show in the next few minutes have a
similarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all grown on the same media or
treatments, media treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have different rootstocks that
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a diversity, whether it is a
diversity panel of rootstocks or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a structured population where we can
do some genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they all have the same cyan
grafted on it so that we can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: separate perhaps the effects of individual
cyan properties that the rootstocks may
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good system and we measure
everything on the common cyan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So way back then we devised in
collaboration with Dr. Robinson and Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cricklist, who was a visiting scientist
from Lithuania.
[SPEAKER_01]: We designed a few experiments,
one that would look at pH effects on apple
[SPEAKER_01]: rootstocks and the other one that would
look at apple replant disease and
[SPEAKER_01]: different soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another one that investigated the
genetics of soil, of tree nutrition and
[SPEAKER_01]: the root architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published some of the results from
these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the experiments looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Darius Cricklist who did most of
the real hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here he is looking at root systems and
washing them and categorizing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these plants were grown in a
randomized system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these pots, these were the original
plants before they were budded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see what a field of them looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all individually, fairly
irrigated or hand fertilized, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were many different experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first experiment that I'd like to
talk about is where we have two different
[SPEAKER_01]: soil types, a sandy loam and a clay loam
from replant soils in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different treatments within the soil,
steam pasteurized and unpasteurized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was that both the soil
and the soil and the treatment had an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on nutrient concentrations in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We harvested the five leaves from each
replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you're looking at the means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that the pasteurization
treatment had an effect on final tree
[SPEAKER_01]: heights of most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we find nutrients like iron and
molybdenum kind of being connected somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: to the tree heights or how well the plant
grew and to the pasteurization treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other elements that were
dependent more on the type of soil than
[SPEAKER_01]: the pasteurization treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, potassium was one of those
where in sandy soils, there was more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of potassium in the leaves
than in not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were, I don't know if I,
they were 38 different rootstocks
[SPEAKER_01]: representing pretty much genetic
diversity, the worldwide genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: of apple rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, so you can take all of
that data and you can group rootstocks by
[SPEAKER_01]: their nutrient concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a graph that looks like this
where some are more in the higher range
[SPEAKER_01]: and others are really, really in the low
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in the sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture looks a little bit different
in clay soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another complexity to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't want to have to work with,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somehow it has to be incorporated into
the knowledge base to develop new
[SPEAKER_01]: rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps the answer is going to be to
sometime in the future to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop something that is adapted to most
soil types and most environments but my
[SPEAKER_01]: guess is that if you want to really crank
apples from a certain soil type,
[SPEAKER_01]: then perhaps you can select that and you
can maximize that opportunity using
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm that we already have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another complexity, pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 33 different rootstocks and
treated the Cornell mix, adjusted to
[SPEAKER_01]: different pH, ranging from 4.5 to 8.5 and
looked at what the effect was of pH in
[SPEAKER_01]: general onto all these different
rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some, what's interesting is that some
rootstocks, here's the, the phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: the phosphorus concentration in leaves,
the rootstocks were quite different in
[SPEAKER_01]: their curves, their individual curves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a significant nutrient
concentration by rootstock interaction and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually rootstocks by pH interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this becomes yet another thing
that you have to worry about when
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing upper rootstocks because some
upper rootstocks that may be well adapted
[SPEAKER_01]: here in low pH soils, typical of New York
state, may not work as well in the Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountains or other places where the pH is
a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is the molybdenum, for example,
which it shows that the pH treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: worked because of the shape of the curve
overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found also in all of these data,
some relationships between nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: were generalized in among all rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a relationship between copper
and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty strong and it doesn't change
very much by the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could show you maybe 50 different,
more grass like this and not all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the overall picture of the
relationships between the pH and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: these are all the pHs put together and
represents the whole data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that some relationships,
for example, between calcium and magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: are still very significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or here you have the one that I showed you
earlier between phosphorus and copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these relationships,
they tend to affect the final growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at an individual pH
treatment, you can classify certain
[SPEAKER_01]: rootstocks or group them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to what they like or their
similarity based on nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dealt with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I show you now the wider germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going into a segregating
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had three replicas graphed with Gala
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're looking at the QTLs or QTL
analysis of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the overall status or relationship
of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within this data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the relationships that we saw earlier
with the pH and replant, some of them kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these basically represent the
segregation of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the variability that's caused by
the segregation of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at individual genotypic
means here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some things that are very
well connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may share same mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can summarize those relationships
by looking at in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium and calcium, they seem to
have a very, very tight relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very, pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, phosphorus and potassium
also share quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc and copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other interesting
relationship was sulfur and manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see right here, sodium,
which is absorbed, I think, in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: different way than most of these
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the out group or represents a very
different beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take all that data and you connect it
to the genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendel's laws and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compare means of plants that have one
allele locus versus another allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was that we could find
significant effects caused by the
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation of alleles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on chromosome five for potassium
concentration in leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting here is the
dwarfing locus one is here, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to nutrient, to potassium
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have recombinants that show
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my question to you, the audience,
maybe, you can tell me what, going from 16
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams per gram of potassium
concentration leaves to 28 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the range.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean to the whole plant,
the whole tree, to the fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have illuminated thoughts,
I would mostly welcome them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, right here, you can break down
the segregation of the individual alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that there is a lower
allele combination and a higher one and
[SPEAKER_01]: then two middle ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the same thing for sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a major effect on chromosome
17.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems to, it's fairly close to the S
locus, but far enough to not be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we have almost a doubling of
the amount of sodium into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean to the tree or to
the fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find copper, QTLs that increase or
decrease copper in the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the picture looks a little
bit like this, which is very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of a little bit
maddening.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have seen me walk by my office and
I've got four screens and I've got this
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm trying to understand what the
relationship between this and this locus
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more data is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the message here is that we
have genetic variation that we can harness
[SPEAKER_01]: if we want to target certain nutrient
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's heritable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another complication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does nutrient concentration relate
to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a type of root morphology that is
also segregating in that same population
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were studying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, we have like minor QTLs
perhaps that show up on negative four,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not much on, well, a little bit on 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mapped this morphology change and a
lot of the effects are somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: independent of morphology, meaning that
this perhaps sits somewhere in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that root morphology is so important
because it shows up in about 80% of our
[SPEAKER_01]: released root stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a typical M9 root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't branch out very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a G41, G935.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one in that population,
G214.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we find that somehow this was
selected based on yield efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: This morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does this affect the way fruit is
produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're still in the process of
evaluating the importance of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see a segregating population,
when you look at the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, potassium, magnesium,
and phosphorus and try to group and find
[SPEAKER_01]: out different groups, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find perhaps root stocks that
have similarities just based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: alleles that they inherited from the two
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps if you here add the yield
efficiency and a few more columns,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can begin to find which root stock has
some of these properties that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, I've mostly spoken about
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at leaves in a scion,
but heck, you don't taste leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know some people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next iteration for this set of
experiments was to look at fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to be bold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, we have the same population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's look at what happens in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a field in lumens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil is fairly uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silt loam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the same population that we
were studying in these buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grafted with gala, again, and it's
replicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we collected fruit and leaves for
mineral analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to thank Sarah Bauer and Todd
Holleran for working very hard with this
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment, our technician, because they
work long hours preparing the material for
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at fruit concentrations,
OK, so here in this orchard, we looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: a leaf as well as fruit from the same
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit was collected prior to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't want to collect things based
on different maturities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we collected five mature leaves from
different parts of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are overall genotypic means that
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see is that we have maintained
some relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, this is phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fruits, phosphorus and fruit,
potassium, they are in this box right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those relationships are still pretty
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are negative relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have leaf magnesium and fruit
boron that seem to be inversely related to
[SPEAKER_01]: these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find a lot of relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mind you, this right here,
this diversity, or this is genotypic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's segregation of genes that's
causing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there is a little bit of
air built into it, or more than an air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to perhaps select material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first time that we looked
at nitrogen in both in fruit and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found this interesting relationship
between tree diameter, fruit sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, and fruit nitrogen
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the trees got bigger, you had less
nitrogen concentration in fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And less sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I have no idea why sulfur and
nitrogen are behaving in a similar manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps some of you can explain that to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember that QTL, the big QTL that we
found in leaves, in potted plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: in almost the perfect environment that we
could, it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as perfect as Neil, as the
hydroponics that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember that QTL for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we found it in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to find it in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it is, in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what happens in the fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that in the fruit,
I think the blue are the leaves right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red are the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is very little variation that's
caused by the alleles at the potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because we know what gene it is,
we're able to mark and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a little bit of variation,
but it's still detectable and significant
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, fruit potassium and fruit and
leaf potassium are highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something else that's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have another QTL for fruit potassium
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not located here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere else in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a story that will come later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how does, and now we're beginning to
connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we took some very rudimental
fruit quality data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple one was bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the pressure, the mean fruit
pressure based on, I think, 20 fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: collected from each individual tree in
that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're just looking at trunk
diameter and how the relationships between
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next stage is to increase this
experiment to encompass perhaps more fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at nutrient concentrations and
storability and bricks and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that the root stock,
at least, is having an effect on bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: and the maturity of the apple or how soft
that apple is after, I think, it was two
[SPEAKER_01]: months of storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, can we select root
stocks that do a better job at maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: that perhaps increasing bricks and
maintaining a good firmness to the apple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, another complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what root stocks will we choose in this
case if we were just looking at this
[SPEAKER_01]: population as the breeder does and we're
looking, discarding dwarfing and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these other elements?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just based on nitrogen phosphorus,
potassium and magnesium, you see that they
[SPEAKER_01]: group pretty well and potassium and
phosphorus kind of go along together for
[SPEAKER_01]: the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do this, but there are still a
lot of questions that need to be answered
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next five, 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on whether we get the
multimillion dollar grants to fund this,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you guys have any ideas and
then want to study this, please,
[SPEAKER_01]: I welcome your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have found is that the
nutrient concentrations are modified by
[SPEAKER_01]: many segregating loci in a germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treeside affects treesides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can affect fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just by having an effect on treesides and
where the fruit exposure is to the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is significant root stock by
genotype soil interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be the source of terroir
for apple cider or something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the questions, does nutrient
efficiency have any effect on disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disease resistance, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have interesting data that might show
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then should we select for higher low
potassium in our germplasm?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the easy ones, but we can do
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What genes are underneath all of these and
specific genes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were lucky to find the potassium one
because there was an AQTL sitting right on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of our potassium QTL and that was
like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can we look at different nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium, can we increase calcium,
decrease nitrogen and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different science that we've
grafted onto the same populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're expanding this work on
different other population of root stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I didn't quite
explain is that the root stock may have
[SPEAKER_01]: certain properties in terms of absorption
and translocation, but the cyan may have
[SPEAKER_01]: its own properties, its own channels,
its own things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at the interaction I think
is going to be critical and important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the perspective of the grower,
how does a single gene or a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that affect nutrient absorption and
translocation, how can they modify the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we manage things in the orchard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they gonna make money or are they
gonna be detrimental?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all good questions that need
a few million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the right is a little bit curvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to imagine myself in a Ferrari
and if I have to build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you for your time and if you
have any questions.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
