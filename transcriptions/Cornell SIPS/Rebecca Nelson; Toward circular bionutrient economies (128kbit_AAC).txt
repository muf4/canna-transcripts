[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Andy, and thank you
everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it circular bio nutrient economy or is
it the pizza?
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, I appreciate your being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, so I'd like to thank the section
of strong crop science for the invitation
[SPEAKER_02]: and to say that it came about because I'm
trying to recruit a student who's a real
[SPEAKER_02]: circular bio nutrient economist and this
section would be a better host for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd rather become a soil scientist than
a plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the consensus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, my desire to be part of this
family arises from the deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: considerations that Andy outlined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of myself as in part of this sort
of one health framework that planetary
[SPEAKER_02]: health is determining soil health or
influencing soil health, which influences
[SPEAKER_02]: plant health and which influences human
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so seeing myself within that,
I'm sort of shifting from the plant health
[SPEAKER_02]: to the soil health, which seems to be
something that's going on in the broader
[SPEAKER_02]: SIPS community.
[SPEAKER_02]: This word cloud that Joss presented at the
10th anniversary party show 2020,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working solidly on genomics of
resistance and by now, much more
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish I could say I was driving that
change, but I think I'm just reflecting
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a shift in interest that's broader
than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my interest in bio nutrient
circularity, I share with a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: people in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very keen to help as we try to
improve our internal capacity for
[SPEAKER_02]: analyzing nutrients, contaminants,
and other materials internally here at
[SPEAKER_02]: SIPS and at Cornell, because I think a lot
of us are suffering from limitations in
[SPEAKER_02]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, I'd like to talk about this idea
of circular food systems, circular bio
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Andy mentioned, the professional pivots
that got me to this place and sort of some
[SPEAKER_02]: initial progress in a long process,
explorations, experiments, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: downside risks, how can change happen here
and in Africa as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And before diving in, I want to thank my
wonderful colleagues in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Christina, known to many of you,
could be thanked for a bunch of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Florissa, our lab manager,
we've got a great team of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: many of whom are undergraduates,
some of whom are present here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johannes' lab is important, key
collaborators in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schwann Liao in global development as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Charles Medig is my lead partner in
Kenya, and we have the pleasure of working
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Rich Earth Institute and the
Whiter Soil Factory Network on this sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the basic proposition that I'll be
putting forth today is the idea that we
[SPEAKER_02]: would redirect our bodily nutrients,
particularly from urine, from the aquatic
[SPEAKER_02]: environment to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, since we direct those nutrients
into the aquatic environment, it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: hazard for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got harmful algal blooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got eutrophication and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many situations, the land and
agriculture are suffering from depletion
[SPEAKER_02]: of nutrients and carbon, or nutrients in
this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the extent to which this is a big deal
depends on the context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So globally speaking, urinary nutrients
would account for around 19% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nitrogen that we put on our
crops, about 11% of the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the US, it's sort of a bit less
than that because we import and export so
[SPEAKER_02]: much nutrient in the form of food and
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in many African countries,
the amount of nutrients in the urine there
[SPEAKER_02]: would exceed the amount of nutrients they
apply as synthetic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could do much better with
agriculture if they were redirecting their
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know if any of you have
seen the pea saw we have on the Ag Quad
[SPEAKER_02]: for some festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with Johannes' squad, we're able to
show with that that in New York State,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we could take the urinary nutrients
from New York City and apply them,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would cover much of the nutrient
farmers in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Paris, the agricultural environment
around there, which is a lot, could
[SPEAKER_02]: completely suffice its nitrogen needs and
about half its phosphorus needs if it used
[SPEAKER_02]: Paris' urban urinary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so where you are, the details
depend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's generally, I think, a proposition
worth considering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was standing on a bridge in Niamey,
New York, a while back, watching this
[SPEAKER_02]: camel come into town with a bunch of cow
pee, a load of cow pee holmes on its back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a festival coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, how long can this go on?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bringing all the carbon and
nutrients from the already depleted
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural soils into the city where it
winds up as being pollution for the urban
[SPEAKER_02]: and aquatic environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And globally speaking, 2.3 billion people
lack even basic sanitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 80% of excreta go untreated into the
waterways while we're further depleting
[SPEAKER_02]: our agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fundamentals are untenable here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so I'm thinking, what can we do
about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, I'm with these farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually from a videotape of
my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this farmer group, 10,000 farmer group
led by Aminul Ali here, they were asking
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves that question, like,
where are we going to get our nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started applying urine to
their fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gotten to be a big thing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really inspired by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I realized, well, actually,
it's not just some back and beyond people
[SPEAKER_02]: in a remote, difficult situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The French are super into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got companies that are making
fertilizers from urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got an entire neighborhood of
Paris that's plumbing for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like the way they show that
yellow gold rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got style, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the way they show the fact that
in terms of the food that we take in,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nutrients we take in, most of the NPK
come out in our urine, relatively little
[SPEAKER_02]: in our feces.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, from the micronutrients are
coming out more in the poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have risk of having not enough of
some of those micronutrients if we use
[SPEAKER_02]: urine as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also really like the way these Swiss are
showing this bigger vision of,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, food comes into the city from the
countryside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be coming out as biowaste.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their signature move for how to
technically pull it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The carbon and nutrients should return to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you'll recognize that as a
plea for sort of circularity in the food
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we live in an indescribably wasteful
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you think about it, don't think
about it as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll wreck your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so this is provoking a lot of people
start thinking about circular economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we design out waste, keep
materials in circulation, and regenerate
[SPEAKER_02]: nature?
[SPEAKER_02]: This being a very powerful thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: These being very practicable tactics and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people generally distinguish between
how you go about it for biological
[SPEAKER_02]: materials and how you go about it for
technical materials are quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the literature on circular
economy, I did a citation search,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you find that over the last few years,
27 to 2013, you go from 800 and some to
[SPEAKER_02]: 8,000 and some citations per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of them, the vast majority,
are about the technical materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only 15% have relevance to the food
system as indicated by searching circular
[SPEAKER_02]: economy and food system nutrient or
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're bringing up the rear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: People often think of circular economy as
these neat loops, phone to phone,
[SPEAKER_02]: carpet to carpet.
[SPEAKER_02]: For organic materials, it's more like this
beautiful tangle of these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from a nice paper about
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's complicated operationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And materially, it's complicated downside
risk-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have fewer tactics at our disposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be doing technical
materials, you can reuse, repair,
[SPEAKER_02]: refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're looking at biologicals,
you're with a much smaller set of R words.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as Johannes has pointed out,
we can also simplify the concept for how
[SPEAKER_02]: do we bring the carbon and nutrients in
our food system back to the soil and then
[SPEAKER_02]: back to our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in some ways, in some moments,
that allows us, again, to simplify.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, a lot of this work is done by
organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it's conceptually more
complicated, it's technically a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times more easy because your biology is
doing the work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a minority of circular economy
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still very happening literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if people remember Achim
Doberman's talk here a few years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got synthetic fertilizer as the
foundation of the circular food system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or circular-ish food system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's pointing out that we could do
much better about bringing whole products
[SPEAKER_02]: from animal and plant agriculture back
into animal and plant agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he notably wouldn't acknowledge
excreta in this vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Johannes and I call him up afterward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Achim, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I worked at the International Rice
Research Institute millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we co-wrote SDG2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, Achim, this is not our first
dispute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he wasn't budging.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is interested, though, in animal
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Johannes is working on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is my kind of simplified view of
the conventional linear food system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, I guess, crops around 70%
dependent on synthetic nitrogen at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go through crops, livestock,
and people, your veg, or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have these massive byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crop residues, animal and human excreta,
and food waste, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of really hideous harms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deforestation because of the inefficiency
of the system, greenhouse gases driving
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change, nutrient pollution
destroying our aquatic ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're looking at the planetary
boundaries, it's nutrient pollution and
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants that are kind of two of the
blockbuster horrible things that we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we are working on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think circularity is one of the ways
we can improve here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at these three byproducts of
the food system, we just put in a paper
[SPEAKER_02]: from our NIFA team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in the USA alone, human and animal
excreta pose a $5-plus billion a year
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm calling those the organic
underutilized resources, just because it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds kind of nice, even though it's
slightly perverting the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we make use of those materials
better?
[SPEAKER_02]: So doing anything as demanding as
circularizing the food system has many
[SPEAKER_02]: frontiers, technical, legal, regulatory,
operational, sociocultural.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting where we are, where types of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can use, if we're clever enough
to use a series of transformation
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches together, we can turn those
waste products into resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, use these resources anyway
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biological processes like composting,
anaerobic digestion, like soldier fly
[SPEAKER_02]: larvae, livestock in general, pigs and
chickens and whatnot, can transform these
[SPEAKER_02]: organic waste into useful foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those processes just go better with
biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every biology works better with biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And biochar works better if you've fried
and chopped and pelleted your material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we bring these together to more
efficiently circularize the food system?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got these three material
transformations, and we're looking to turn
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole bunch of ours, including the three
I've mentioned, but also invasive species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agro-industrial products and byproducts
and more into feed, food, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, soil amendments in order to
improve food security, carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: sequestration, reduce emissions,
provide sanitation, improve public health
[SPEAKER_02]: and employment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to make all that happen,
we not only need this sort of technical
[SPEAKER_02]: angle, but we need a lot of social,
to really transform the food system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to change how we think and feel
about excreta and other wastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we process, we're so centralized and
these are low value gross, messy things
[SPEAKER_02]: and centralized models really can't make
any sense with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously there's a lot of legal
regulatory change that needs to happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: make this possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to conceive of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily there's some nice synergies that
can be found amongst these methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon and nutrients play nice together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biochar and biology, as I mentioned,
if you start co-localizing activities and
[SPEAKER_02]: coordinating sectors, it can start to
actually pick up speed and make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of work to do to make all
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's worth it, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is sort of an eyeful of what a
circular version would look like with
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe these biological and thermochemical
processes together making these waste
[SPEAKER_02]: products sort of work for soil and crops
for people and animals, including insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did I come to this view of things,
priorities?
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of summarizes why I'm working in
maize genetics and there's only so much
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics can do when you're sort of look
like that and acts like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not only poor yield, but it's a
poisonous yield that you get when it looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed those years of maize
genetics, starting with trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the inheritance of a suite of
diseases that affect our major crop in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States as well as in Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got really sucked up in these ear diseases
that provide these pervasive toxic effects
[SPEAKER_02]: and how the specific traits of the ear and
the plant determine resistance to those
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal pathogens and their mycotoxin
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a whole bunch of stuff with water
genetics and some grain sorting work and
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I came to the view that there are a
lot of trade-offs involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for genetics and breeding, for grain
sorting and biological control,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's massive clear trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the win-win that I could spot was
enhancing soil health and working with
[SPEAKER_02]: people to improve system health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple of glimpses of our results
that are relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Kenyan student worked with a summit to
look at a couple of places in Eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenya and just highlighting here the same
season, low nitrogen and high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the mycotoxin, the aflatoxin
indicators here, also true for fumonacin,
[SPEAKER_02]: are way worse with the low nitrogen than
the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking over here at a different site,
the low nitrogen looks a lot like the low
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen here, but with even more
astronomical levels of aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with an eye in the sky, we could
actually predict based on available soil
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters and drought indicators,
we could predict to some extent aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_02]: in a few surveys that we've published in
these papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will's paper came out right before he lost
his job, USAID, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this made me feel like toxic grain is
a symptom of these larger challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got soil depletion and drought that
come together to stress our plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that leads to, again, poor yields and
toxic yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what looked to me initially like of
proud to be so integrated about our
[SPEAKER_02]: mycotoxin work to look quite inadequate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really have to go before the season and
look at soil health and resilience after
[SPEAKER_02]: the season to look at surveillance from
satellite data, crop data, but also bio
[SPEAKER_02]: indicators of mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to feel like we're strapping
urine bags on babies and going to
[SPEAKER_02]: hospitals for urinary aflatoxin
biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wouldn't it be nice to have
source-separating sanitation that could
[SPEAKER_02]: also contribute to the surveillance
program?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up thinking, well, shoot,
if I've got to handle the urine anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: why would I do it in a baby bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not do it as part of an integrated
circular system where we're monitoring the
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, the food, and the body, and we're
using the body product again to fight the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we build that soil health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can we get that soil carbon and
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can probably guess where I'm
going with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to those people in Niger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really proud that my program was
funding this farmer organization and
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting them not only to come up with,
I mean, we didn't support them to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got an agronomist talking to the farmer
leadership who suggested urine as an
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative that was not popular
initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after a few years, hundreds of farmers
are using urine as a fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're able to publish their results
with the first author there is a young
[SPEAKER_02]: woman that is not a normal thing in that
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was real proud of how that worked
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this inspired a lot of other people to
at least consider that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The film that my son made was prompted by
Bethman Vecchia, a graduate from this
[SPEAKER_02]: department.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know her?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Beth brought that video to East Africa
to lobby the farmers in East Africa to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider these findings, and slow going,
but making progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is another thing I was
pleased about from my McKnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a scientific director for a couple
of decades, and that Niger work was
[SPEAKER_02]: something I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in response to that, I asked this
other group to, or I worked with them to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them a grant, and they're looking
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In another West African country,
this is Burkina Faso.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ouagadougou, sort of the
agricultural area around it, and a broader
[SPEAKER_02]: Burkina.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bring in a bunch of nutrients into
Ouagadougou from the hinterlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they say, urination constitutes,
that's major uncontrolled nitrogen flows,
[SPEAKER_02]: by far the fattest arrow coming out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urination, this is from the end of the
abstract, urination constitutes a dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen loss pathway, and urine
collecting initiatives could provide
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable fertilizer adapted to local
agricultural requirements and constraints,
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing the urban system sustainability
by enhancing regional food provision,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as reducing sanitation induced
water pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first author was a guy I learned a
lot from when I was on sabbatical in
[SPEAKER_02]: France.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate the way they sort of
worked this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it isn't just West Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dynamic, this is sort of a very
old idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're using government and grandma,
the idea of projecting the beauty of
[SPEAKER_02]: bodily circulation and projecting the
practicality of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the heck we can't do that and spare no
accumulation of phosphorus, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and carbon compounds in our waterways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to gain momentum here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to do in the United States for some
reason, but when the conflict started in
[SPEAKER_02]: Ukraine three years back, I got interest
from a New York Times reporter who's a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend of my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wrote that article about
P-cyclers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They immediately spawned a rash of other
propaganda, I mean, other articles in
[SPEAKER_02]: various, I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one of them was about the work in
Niger, which I was really pleased with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so this is sort of becomes part of
my mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we make change?
[SPEAKER_02]: Partly it's sort of getting our fabulous
work into the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what are we up to around this,
around here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about P, you can either
use it as is, but it's heavy and low
[SPEAKER_02]: value, or you can make it into a fancier
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Johannes and I, John, he represents
this side more and I'm more over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we both are fans of both, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my thinking about the just using P as
is was really focused on an interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: that peri-urban population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 40% of humanity lives in peri-urban
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of these people are living in slums,
informal settlements.
[SPEAKER_02]: These peri-urban areas are like too dense
maybe to farm, but here there's some space
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're told to go, you know, implement
this kind of garden, but then the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: people have access to is full of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we use crop residues together with
excreta to be able to do this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but safely?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started with straw bale gardening
because it's kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calling it grow as you go,
or you go gardening because of the P
[SPEAKER_02]: component.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my Musgrave farm manager for
support, not only tolerating, but
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting me to get going on this while I
was trying to be, you know, the maize
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics continues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you might have right now seen
the somewhat mediocre straw bale gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: there at Caldwell as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was sort of exploratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we sort of shift into more
experimental mode here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Musgrave farm manager introduced me to
the Dillman Hill farm managers with the
[SPEAKER_02]: hint that that was a much more appropriate
place to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dillman Hill has a legacy of heavy metals
from its time as a orchard, piece of the
[SPEAKER_02]: orchard where they're using arsenic and
lead as pesticides in the orchard
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, working on raised beds and
red gardens are similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a lot of sense there,
psychically, and the student environment's
[SPEAKER_02]: great there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessie's here somewhere, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a couple of messages from that
work so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sort of leaning on 2023 and 2024
findings from our Dillman Hill machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, plant, you know, the kale in
2023 grew similarly with urine as with
[SPEAKER_02]: Miracle-Gro on soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So urine is good fertilizer up to a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our substrates really suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really bad with urine, way better,
way worse than with Miracle-Gro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, Miracle-Gro and urine are
par on maize stover and on soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our organic substrates are looking
really not competitive here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jen's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a little experiment mixing up,
you know, comparing virgin wheat that was
[SPEAKER_02]: in the barn with weathered wheat that was
sitting around outside for a year or so
[SPEAKER_02]: with composted wheat that we'd used for
the struggle of gardening with fine stover
[SPEAKER_02]: and a mix of those two and with and
without biochar here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically you have to kind of age,
you know, the wheat quite a bit to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: what fine stover is on day one out of the
barn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's sort of a hint there,
not significant, but maybe blending is
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: No biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biochar effect detected.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulatory authority saw it was going
to be World War III when we applied urine
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant science barn after a
considerable struggle with the
[SPEAKER_02]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a tough start for the best guess
our substrate, which is now a mix of
[SPEAKER_02]: composted wheat, compost and different
levels of biochar, we actually came out on
[SPEAKER_02]: par slightly ahead of the commercial
potting mix across that trial and looked
[SPEAKER_02]: like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No World War III.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really you don't smell pee after you're
like the first immediate application if
[SPEAKER_02]: you put it on a soil or soil-like
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally pee works well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our hours work well if you blend them
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to kind of pit
bio-nutrient circularity against
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the high yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got these other arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a lot of, you know,
the dings on them that I mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_02]: downsides presentation, but we got a bunch
of downsides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them might be that there's a
lot of salt in our diets and therefore in
[SPEAKER_02]: our urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a bunch of other problems as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hitting the salt here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at the kale tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kale came out saltier on weeds,
more so on the hours than on the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The substrates came out saltier,
the hours and also on the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't really have a big effect on
the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing some washout experiments I'll
mention here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this last year we did three different
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lettuce, a tomato and a lettuce
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, showing the tomato because I
won't say anything further about that for
[SPEAKER_02]: the moment, but just to show that on this
incredibly bad looking mix of wheat straw
[SPEAKER_02]: maize, rudely chopped maize stover right
off the combine and some compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: plus or minus biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants really are pretty indifferent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're quite competitive with
soil, which is totally weird and
[SPEAKER_02]: unexpected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we're benchmarking well in terms
of lettuce, yield, soil's a little worse
[SPEAKER_02]: off here probably because we overdosed the
synthetic on soil because I think we did a
[SPEAKER_02]: little initial overdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that it's growing quite
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urine versus miracle grow here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking now at water flush level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put up the high tunnel at Dillman so we
could manage the water trying to explore
[SPEAKER_02]: this issue of what about the salt levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the first lettuce season on
the organic underutilized resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: More water is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: More water is better on ours, on soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I screwed that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urine, synthetic nutrients, ours soil,
ours soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the urine is doing sort of better
overall and more water is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it a salt thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like not as far as we can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the few cases where we get
a biochar effect because usually we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: stressing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems biochar steps to the rescue
apparently when there's either water,
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient or too much ammonia stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, this is the low flush,
medium and high flush, different amounts
[SPEAKER_02]: of water per 20 liter sack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the urine treatment I thought would be
getting better over the time, but with no
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar, it's getting worse by this third
season and it's much worse with a high
[SPEAKER_02]: washout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the biochar is just holding
nutrients for that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the high washout is just washing
nutrients out of the, this is all the
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's the only significant
effect here, but it is quite striking that
[SPEAKER_02]: our third season, the third season with
the same set of sacks are starting to look
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty shabby with urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something that we need to
amend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly those micronutrients that are
initially supplied by the organic
[SPEAKER_02]: materials and they're not adequate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we provided them in the urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so glad that Jesse's here because
he and colleagues and Christina,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're also exploring this idea that we can
frame this issue as a matter of nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: sovereignty for people for whom that
concept is meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our buddies in New York feel like that
kind of resonates with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black gardeners organization,
they like that concept apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is an experiment with some
indigenously, crops of interest to the
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous students that Jesse's
representing and that's a skunk beans and
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco and ceremonial tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are urine plus or minus urine
and synthetic plus or minus wood vinegar
[SPEAKER_02]: and food testing, other furred against
fish effluent from the aquaculture
[SPEAKER_02]: enterprise frass from the black soldier
fly enterprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tobacco showed a strong yield
effect where synthetic and urine were
[SPEAKER_02]: fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these others were not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beans did not show a strong yield effect,
but they showed a very strong protein
[SPEAKER_02]: content effect, percent nitrogen effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was quite interesting
and notable that these pale plants clearly
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't getting on nutrient in these
treatments, the fish effluent and frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they responded by just having more
carbohydrates and less protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, going forward, we're looking at
how different ingredients, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: non-ours, the biochar, the mineral
component that we could dope in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furtigons can influence the biology,
the chemistry and the physics of the
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at Christina's leading work
on nematodes and fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us is working with Steve Vanik on the
eco place to look at the bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: populations and communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better understanding the chemical
situations here and some of the physical
[SPEAKER_02]: transformations that occur, size particle
distribution shifts and how they occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited about some of the
experiments we have on greenhouse gases in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular now in this winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christina's done a bit of work on that on
a larger scale, thinking here about what
[SPEAKER_02]: are the implications for these matters
when you're looking at composting at
[SPEAKER_02]: domestic and municipal scales,
which is a big deal because legally you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to compost if you're a big operation
in New York State, Vermont, everybody has
[SPEAKER_02]: to compost everything organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to be all you go
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have implications for larger scale
composting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, Christina is comparing leaves
without biochar, furtigued with water or
[SPEAKER_02]: urine, leaves with 5% biochar,
water and urine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that without biochar,
urine is getting a lot more nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powerful greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not the case when the 5%
biochar is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very preliminary, A.
[SPEAKER_02]: B, it's also expected based on the
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: C, I think it could be a big deal because
I'm a master composter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear a word one about biochar,
the entire master composting training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, yeah, we should be,
Janice, we got to put this in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that composting can lead to
high greenhouse gas emissions,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you start using urine,
which I'm pushing for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But biochar and mineral additives can
reduce GHG production during composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This again is somewhat established,
not to Jean Bonatel's satisfaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we learned about green, green,
brown, green, green and brown composting
[SPEAKER_02]: sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be black and gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my cereal residues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I think there are practical
implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we could work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are sort of reaching into the
community with our UGO gardening at the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil factory.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are P powered raised beds with yard
waste and whatever we've got stuffed
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put urine around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We frame it in straw bales and put urine
on the straw bales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then between seasons, dump that now
onto the garden and rebuild it with new
[SPEAKER_02]: straw bales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice indigenous gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardening component to that going nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is sort of some of those
same types of gardens up here at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Gilman Hill Student Organic Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, because it's suitable because of
that contaminated soil legacy,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are liaising with our friends and
family down in New York to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: does this have implications for green
cities?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're interested in using biochar in the
Bronx.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a quasi Joseph's terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've got a nice collaboration
sort of inching forward in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so how about contaminants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna say much about it,
but there is some emerging literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: People often ask, what about
pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_02]: We take in a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out, just like our nutrients
come out in our pee, so do our pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's some initial indication
from other groups that this high nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer value and low uptake of pharma
is probably not fair to just leave it at
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but I will leave it at that for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did spend a year working on this
National Academies panel about exploring
[SPEAKER_02]: linkages between soil health and human
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And contamination was one of the big
themes that came out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gave me a chance to kind of get on
the boards with my mycotoxin point,
[SPEAKER_02]: the links between soil health and
mycotoxins, this point about excreta.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just this issue of contaminants is
huge in soil health more broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: With or without anything to do with what
I'm talking about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet this circularity will only
compound those concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna point out that one of the
rays of hope that our committee found was
[SPEAKER_02]: that pyrolysis in primitive realization
here in a Contiki, at any scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of heating material organics
at really high temperatures can break
[SPEAKER_02]: bonds in organic contaminants,
your pharma, your PFAS even, and also the
[SPEAKER_02]: product is helpful in immobilizing the
same bad things, including non-organic
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants, heavy metals and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that I think is
important in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to update you a bit also about
what I'm most excited about, which is what
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got going on in Kenya, both in rural
and in urban contexts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing you here to the Republic of
Kenya and its little corner of Lake
[SPEAKER_02]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Lake Victoria, the Kenyan corner
has this little pinch-off thing called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Nyantza Gulf where you're getting
increasing likelihood of harmful algal
[SPEAKER_02]: blooms as you get a little piece of the
lake pinched off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that they're becoming
increasingly likely wherever people meet
[SPEAKER_02]: the lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So land and lake, we're not friends here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simplest thing you could do is just
put pee on the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going on in our, in Mumias
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start in Mumias.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then take us down to the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the farmers were not super keen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought that was gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we discussed all the possible things
you can do if you're able to source
[SPEAKER_02]: separate urine, you can put on your crop
on your raised bed, your compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can make this nice fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were down with the compost angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know they need to improve their
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making compost and they're like,
okay, with the idea of doping it up with
[SPEAKER_02]: their bodily nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got super pumped about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Mumias now and you pee,
you're a kid and you pee here or there
[SPEAKER_02]: like you always used to do, you are in
trouble because you need to be gathering
[SPEAKER_02]: that up for your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're big into the composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They form a farmer research network.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got formal experiments,
informal experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer leader Harun here still wearing
his badge from our seedbed meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He dug out all the pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he included the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I know I was way out ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also not happy about that,
but it worked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say, anyway, they're going
gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And moving back to Kisumu on Batnyansa
Gulf.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got excited about the, you know,
hot quenched.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some evidence from the literature
that hot quenched biochars performs
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be hot quenching.
[SPEAKER_02]: In three years of experiments,
the pee quenched biochars was performing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the chemical fertilizer against the
water quenched in control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we want to improve the
rigor and design of these experiments,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, we're encouraged by the
fact that the stuff is performing well so
[SPEAKER_02]: far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to take it bigger now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenya is the home for the biggest
source-severing sanitation company in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, Sanergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They serve as 150,000 plus people in
Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make fertilizers and other,
black soldier flies and other products
[SPEAKER_02]: from the poop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dump the pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're already showing that you can
tie up the sanitation and fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: production there to some extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got a sub, whatever,
a branch that's moved out to Kisumu out in
[SPEAKER_02]: Western Kenya.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is their toilet factory on the
wastewater treatment plant territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have in the same town,
you know, really vibrant, community-based
[SPEAKER_02]: organization called Kisumu Young
Agri-Printers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Roy who runs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got black soldier flies
producing all these agri- inputs and
[SPEAKER_02]: consolidating product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, obviously I had a bright
idea that they could team up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last time I was in Kenya, we all came
to the table, our Daniel and Pagel at our
[SPEAKER_02]: shack there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Florence who runs Freshly Life
in Kisumu.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Roy who runs that KIA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Charles Mendega, my big
collaborator.
[SPEAKER_02]: This individual is paid by Johannes to
coordinate the regional circular
[SPEAKER_02]: biomechanical economy network,
Eric, Bella.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you may know Bella from here,
who also co-runs that network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, hey, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's that map of the Nyalenda
informal settlement slum there,
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching out to the water body there,
the wastewater treatment plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture here, and the more
middle-class neighborhood here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Florence provided the GPS locations of
all the toilets they service in this slum
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Keith at MenLibrary helped me map it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the different collection
paths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can choose, you know, and take as
many of these collection paths as we want
[SPEAKER_02]: for our experiments or our business here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting to, we worked with,
I worked with this operations research
[SPEAKER_02]: team here at Cornell to kind of figure out
how we could work out the logistics and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully keep working that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on a system dynamic model to
show in principle how the positive
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback loops of getting more people to
pay for the sanitation service,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the cost is lower if he is taking
the job of servicing the toilets off of
[SPEAKER_02]: the back of Fresh Life and making
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get a positive feedback loop
as we put more nutrients into the corn
[SPEAKER_02]: fields, get more corn out, get more maize
out, fertilize more, get more yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photo credit David is working in progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rarely do anything, but I'm making the
darn models I want to credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so there's a lot of challenges
I mentioned, of which sociocultural are
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously leading lights there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to say that, how do we,
how do we change how we think and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: about our excreta?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tiny slice of the
port-a-potties, if you've ever been to
[SPEAKER_02]: Slope Day, you know, port-a-potties as far
as the eye can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should make a video of how many,
I mean, you can even have cuter
[SPEAKER_02]: port-a-potties than that for heaven's
sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, so I really, we really
want to like do some, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: go big to collect our pee here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a little collection effort and at
Porch Fest one time these two young women
[SPEAKER_02]: were the only people who took the time to
look at my technical information around
[SPEAKER_02]: the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: They turned out to be Cornell engineers
and they got us into the Cornell Chronicle
[SPEAKER_02]: for their Plant Parenthood app.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super obsessed with potties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys are probably going to roll
us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out about the potty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, how to make the potty
experience more fun and beautiful and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, save the world while you're at
pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a couple of collection points
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell public health student is helping,
helped us make some nice propaganda about
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just collecting once a week
off a couple of spots, please contribute
[SPEAKER_02]: to plant science and Emerson.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also made some more outward leaning
sort of gardener oriented propaganda here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure we've had any impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Soil Factory is sort of all about this
sort of subject and Johannes put on this
[SPEAKER_02]: workshop where we made all these cute
kitty books and art products around
[SPEAKER_02]: circular bio nutrient economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to keep giving you credit Johannes,
but really making this East African
[SPEAKER_02]: circular bio nutrient economy network
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a biochar and excreta
component.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the carbon trader showing us how
it's done with this ridiculous but very
[SPEAKER_02]: enlightening skit they put on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Cornell delegation,
David and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rich Earth Institute gets credit,
I think, for bringing a global network
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had that 10th annual summit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christina was there in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us there were there virtually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really making a very dynamic,
many dimensional community come to life
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's it really going to take to drive
change?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talk about the opportunities,
local nutrient value, nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: sovereignty, environmental health,
you know, us and our fabulous activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, maybe it's the PFAS crisis
where we can't land apply our product
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no carbon going back to the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than half of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: biosolids are now land applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now recognize the hazards if you bring
your bodily nutrients pre-contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: with all sorts of gross things,
including PFAS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if a few wastewater treatment
plants get hurt by these major storm
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, you know, people are going to
think twice about putting in the many
[SPEAKER_02]: billions, the billions of dollars it takes
to put up one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: See whether there's a disaster or not,
sea levels rise, and then 10 million
[SPEAKER_02]: people are out of service on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: coast if the water goes up three feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long before they're washing away the
plants, it's going to corrode them and put
[SPEAKER_02]: them out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 million people at three meters,
a heck of a lot more with more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just even maintaining wastewater
treatment plants and running them costs 1%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 2% of the global energy budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I really think that we've got to
play our role here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to show how it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine and I are teaching a class about
this, but can we please get the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: producers serving the nutrient users,
the farms and whatnot, learning how to use
[SPEAKER_02]: these different transformation methods,
using our food waste and excreta more
[SPEAKER_02]: creatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's a journey, but hopefully
we'll individually transition through this
[SPEAKER_02]: disgust to comedy, to embrace collectively
from the sort of dealing with nutrients as
[SPEAKER_02]: a problem to dealing with them as a bloody
resource and seeing that as part of a
[SPEAKER_02]: wider transition to a circular comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't leave longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really excited about the ideas you
presented, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you said you didn't want to focus
too much on the issue of pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_03]: and the urine, but I do have a concern
about particularly hormones and birth
[SPEAKER_03]: control hormones that I know come out in
urine and are very prevalent, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: places like the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if you envision some
kind of regulatory testing either for
[SPEAKER_03]: plants or for urine going on to plants,
how would we make sure that we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: getting into another loop of contaminant
spreading like happened with biosolids or
[SPEAKER_03]: sludge?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the hormones are such an
identifiable and particular question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just ask and answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem I have is that there are so
many pharmaceuticals out there that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: take it as a class, it's much more
difficult to answer, but you can ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, for hormones, probably with a
SimpliLyser or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can ask that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't, but I think it's very
practical to ask that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it get into the food or not and to
what extent?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it would have to be some
regular testing, not just a one-time
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a regular application that we're
using as a food system supplement,
[SPEAKER_03]: then how would we eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can ask as a science question,
to what extent do pharmaceuticals come
[SPEAKER_02]: through the soil, plant, food axis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something you could ask,
and then you don't have to test every food
[SPEAKER_02]: item.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it does or does not come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does come through, then we have to
pull the nitrogen out, the phosphorus out,
[SPEAKER_02]: without the whole gamish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving Johannes that angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I work on that too, but in
principle, I'm sort of a dump-it-on
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I take your point that if you've got a
specific hypothesis, you can test it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to suddenly start
accumulating in plants when it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulate in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that if you have a
particular system and a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothesis or a particular question,
then we should definitely address it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably actually known,
and I just don't happen to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It strikes me, there must be a lot of
research on this in China.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go to villages in China and I visit
friends' houses, it's the recyclable
[SPEAKER_04]: toilet that's been doing for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my point is they must have done also
research on these things that are now
[SPEAKER_04]: coming into the stream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they get credit for the time of
memorial category, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have kept their foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've kept their ecosystem going for all
of time with that very explicitly as an
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: More lately, I see it, unfortunately,
that they're kind of going modern and,
[SPEAKER_02]: to some extent, walking away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still going on in the
hinterlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are a part of that dynamic
research ecosystem for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're tracking the literature,
you can bank on them being really doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's frankly over my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But credit to them for going into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I had actually hoped to go to
China last year to sort of do a circular
[SPEAKER_02]: economy tour, partly to be like trying to
lobby to not have them walk away from
[SPEAKER_02]: their historical ownership of the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But take credit and pride in that,
maybe, and recognize the fact that they
[SPEAKER_02]: are, in fact, around the innovations
aren't here for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions for Rebecca?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give her one more round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
