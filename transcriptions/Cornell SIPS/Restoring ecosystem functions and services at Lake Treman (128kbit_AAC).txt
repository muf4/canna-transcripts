[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome you to the Restoration Ecology
2017 cohorts presentation of their class
[SPEAKER_16]: project.
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the objects of the project is
to expose the students to experiential
[SPEAKER_16]: learning.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, a situation where, you know,
you try once, you fail, you try twice,
[SPEAKER_16]: you fail, and then by the third or fourth
time you finally get it figured out how
[SPEAKER_16]: you actually should do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what looks really good on a blackboard
or whiteboard in a classroom situation
[SPEAKER_16]: changes very rapidly when you are in hip
waders and you are in mud, maybe up to
[SPEAKER_16]: your knees.
[SPEAKER_16]: You say, well, maybe I can only do one of
these sample sites, or maybe I can only
[SPEAKER_16]: collect one kind of sample.
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're looking at right now is one of
many drone overflights that we did of,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's called Tremon Lake or Lake Tremon.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more like Tremon Lake and Marsh
Complex.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the dam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, whoa.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were able to do a number of very
interesting things over the past several
[SPEAKER_16]: months, including these drone overflights.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we spent a lot of time canoeing around
and sampling the vegetation and collecting
[SPEAKER_16]: soil samples and so forth.
[SPEAKER_16]: So before we actually get started,
I'm going to encourage everyone to grab a
[SPEAKER_16]: bite to eat if you haven't already done
so.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody still need lunch?
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the class, wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: They look a little bit different than they
do at 8.30 on a Tuesday morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really good to see everyone,
all of you and all of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: And check this out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here are two members of the class standing
in the middle of a little peninsula on the
[SPEAKER_16]: marsh.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to turn things over to class
members right now and Audrey.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Audrey was our TA this year and did a
really good job of keeping me honest and
[SPEAKER_16]: making sure that we didn't leave things
behind.
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't lose any students.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Audrey, do you want to do your
introduction?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all very much for coming today.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spent a full semester working together
a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's wonderful to see it come
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to begin with some history.
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting around 1930, the Civilian
Conservation Corps put in a dam at what
[SPEAKER_07]: was Buttermilk Creek, creating Lake
Treemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so slowly over the years, the area has
been filling with sediment, just like the
[SPEAKER_07]: southern end of the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been filling with sediment ever
since the glaciers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Lake Treemen is really a community
asset.
[SPEAKER_07]: It provides ecosystem services like
sediment mitigation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you speak louder?
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sediment is trapped via the dam,
and so it doesn't go down into the
[SPEAKER_07]: swimming area or Lake Cayuga.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really helpful to the community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over time, the area has changed from
Glickshield to Creek to Lake, and now we
[SPEAKER_07]: see it slowly transitioning into a wetland
marsh.
[SPEAKER_07]: The question now is what we want the
system to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: What it can do for us and what we would
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when talking with the New York State's
Park Department, we decided to address a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple important issues for managing the
area.
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost, we wanted to estimate
the depth of the water and the volume of
[SPEAKER_07]: sediment behind the dam.
[SPEAKER_07]: To do that, we outfitted a canoe with a
handmade bathymetry device.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put on waders and we used 1989 maps
to do these calculations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see some of these calculations
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also wanted to address the evasives on
the site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the state was looking into getting
funding for this, and we wanted to help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put on waders.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grabbed a GPS.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started mapping where the Phragmites
was and where the knotweed was.
[SPEAKER_07]: In doing this, we discovered that there
was a large diversity of evasives that we
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't think would be there because it
looked like a cattail marsh.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also wanted to address environmental
and human health.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we sampled for bacterial
contaminants that would be upstream and
[SPEAKER_07]: downstream of the dam to see if there are
any differences and what the results would
[SPEAKER_07]: be.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also looked at heavy metals and soils
and methane in the sediment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the day, we really
wanted to recognize the ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_07]: and the functions that the site is
currently providing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to provide realistic options
that will help these functions continue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so with help from communities,
some of which are here today, we've done a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're excited to present it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that in mind, thank you all for
coming, and I'll hand it over to Meg for
[SPEAKER_07]: the presentation outline.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our entire semester, so a lot of
work and time went into this, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all the general things we're
going to be going over today in greater
[SPEAKER_09]: detail than Audrey mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Audrey mentioned, the lake was built in
1930 by a dam, by the CCC.
[SPEAKER_09]: For many years, it existed as a lake,
and it was important to the beauty of the
[SPEAKER_09]: area and the beauty of the recreation
facility, also important to keeping
[SPEAKER_09]: sediment out of the swimming pool
downstream.
[SPEAKER_09]: But over time, it filled up with sediment,
16 acres worth about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as it is now, it looks nothing like
what it used to.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a historical map.
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be a stream, and it was turned
into a lake by the dam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within 80-some years, it is now a wetland.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we want to know is, is the
wetland really that bad, or does it
[SPEAKER_09]: provide similar ecosystem services as a
lake?
[SPEAKER_09]: And should it be changed, reverted back to
a lake, or kept as a wetland?
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so some site characteristics.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the positive aspects of the
marsh, not all negative aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: It prevents sediment from flowing into the
swimming area.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that sediment, also fecal
coliforms.
[SPEAKER_09]: It provides an ecosystem for a variety of
plant species and animal species.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it provides a different aesthetic than
the lake.
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw the video.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we want to know is if it's
worthwhile in keeping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hand it off to Tanvi, who is on the
mapping team.
[SPEAKER_17]: I prefer not to use the mic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can everyone hear me if I don't?
[SPEAKER_17]: So general overview is that lake treatment
doesn't exist in limbo.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a pretty large watershed
contributing flow into it.
[SPEAKER_17]: The lake here is represented by that tiny
set of black points in the top left
[SPEAKER_17]: corner.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the watershed itself is very large.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a map of a digital elevation
model.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some very amazing people have allowed us
to have a one meter resolution DEM,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is what we used along with curve
number calculations to delineate the
[SPEAKER_17]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the DEM displaying elevation.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this is a layer representing
curve numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: So high curve numbers represent mean that
there is low permeability in that soil and
[SPEAKER_17]: vice versa for low curve numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a function of both soil type
and land use type.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this was used in conjunction with the
DEM to delineate the watershed.
[SPEAKER_17]: This gives us a little bit more
information about what kind of runoff lake
[SPEAKER_17]: treatment is receiving.
[SPEAKER_17]: So in yellow is agricultural land use.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that kind of represents the hot spots
where we might expect problematic runoff
[SPEAKER_17]: to be contributing to the lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: Using the hydrological models from the DEM
and storm runoff, we could model the
[SPEAKER_17]: general flow of streams in the area.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you zoom in further, this coincided
pretty accurately with the path of water
[SPEAKER_17]: up until we get to lake treatment where
there has been a slight divergence as we
[SPEAKER_17]: would expect.
[SPEAKER_17]: So using all of that data and NRCC storm
information, we calculated runoff for a 24
[SPEAKER_17]: hour storm for various frequencies.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is an example of a frequency
duration curve for a one year storm,
[SPEAKER_17]: a storm of intensity that we can expect to
see once every year.
[SPEAKER_17]: We did this for various frequencies up to
a storm that you would expect to see once
[SPEAKER_17]: every 500 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are the corresponding runoff
rates that we would expect to see at the
[SPEAKER_17]: DEM point.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's commonly accepted practice to model
climate change in the year 2050 by
[SPEAKER_17]: multiplying existing precipitation rates
by a factor of 1.5.
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the flows that we could
expect to see 50 years from now,
[SPEAKER_17]: or less than 50 years, because it's 2017.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I'll hand it over to Kevin to
talk about comparison with historic maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in this 1938 picture,
you can see the lake perfectly as a lake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's no marsh included.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as time progresses, you begin to see
the encroachment of the marsh,
[SPEAKER_02]: which currently stands at 10.89 acres of
the original, about 13 to 16 acre
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint of lake treatment, original lake
treatment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then using those maps, which Susan
Hoskins directed us to, we could look more
[SPEAKER_17]: closely at how the extent of the lake has
changed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a more modern representation,
which is still slightly bigger than the
[SPEAKER_17]: current extent.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is from the 1950s.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see that the lake displayed is
significantly larger, with emerging
[SPEAKER_17]: wetland in the south, depicted by those
dots.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you can see them
currently, but they're emerging.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this is from 1898, before the dam
was constructed.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not completely sure about how
accurate this is because of the equipment
[SPEAKER_17]: that they had in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's the best estimate that we have.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can see here that the lake falls
in this area, and the elevation ranges
[SPEAKER_17]: from 940 feet to 920 feet.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we use that information to determine
the slope while modeling the historic
[SPEAKER_17]: elevation of the stream.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is just a side-by-side comparison.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so our DEM shows us the elevation of
the surface of water, but doesn't tell us
[SPEAKER_17]: what the elevation of the underlying
sediment is like.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Dustin and Jonas and I went out in a
canoe with a bathymetry device and got all
[SPEAKER_17]: these data points representing the depth
of water at different points in the lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could interpolate those to come up
with the general surface of sediment under
[SPEAKER_17]: water.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we could subtract the volume of water
from the current lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then we also had to model the historic
stream, because surprisingly, there were
[SPEAKER_17]: no DEMs in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can talk more about the methodology,
because it was slightly involved.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we basically just raised everything to
the highest elevation, sloped it,
[SPEAKER_17]: and then dug out the channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a DEM?
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, a DEM is a digital elevation model.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's basically just topo lines at a
very high resolution.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then these are our estimates for the
current volume of water in the lake.
[SPEAKER_17]: Acre feet, it might be an easier measure
to think about than meter cubed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you thought of a 63 acre area,
it would be raised to one foot in depth.
[SPEAKER_17]: And an acre is approximately one football
field in size.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the annual deposition is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could expect the sediment to fill
up the lake in about 30 years if current
[SPEAKER_17]: conditions remain the same.
[SPEAKER_17]: To reduce deposition rate, there are
certain hot spots of erosion upstream of
[SPEAKER_17]: the lake that we could address.
[SPEAKER_17]: We could also construct a channel adjacent
to the wetland to allow the water to have
[SPEAKER_17]: a higher velocity, meaning that it would
be depositing less sediment.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Kevin has identified areas of erosion
hot spots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the runoff coefficients and the
land use, we can see certain areas where
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural land and bare agricultural
land contributes mostly, or we believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that contributes mostly to the deposition
of sediment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's these critical areas upstream
of the dam that we believe that the state
[SPEAKER_02]: or somebody should really look into more
depth about controlling the rate of
[SPEAKER_02]: sedimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a step to maybe elongate the amount
of time we have until it needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: dredged or some other measure to control
for the deposition of sediment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then stream bank analysis was conducted
at various sites upstream of the lake to
[SPEAKER_17]: determine what the channel looks like
without human influence or without too
[SPEAKER_17]: much human influence.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did this manually with levels and
meter sticks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we found a general trapezoidal
cross-sectional shape to the channel
[SPEAKER_17]: upstream of the area.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is just two more from other
sites.
[SPEAKER_17]: So based on the cross-sectional area and
the slope of the stream, we determined
[SPEAKER_17]: that use using the Raskin classification
for streams, which is both hydrological
[SPEAKER_17]: and ecological, it falls between C and B.
[SPEAKER_17]: So an intermediate slope liable to changes
in meander shape.
[SPEAKER_17]: The services provided by the current
system with the wetland as it is are that
[SPEAKER_17]: it's potentially treating agricultural
runoff.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do have some water samples that we
tested, but extensive water sampling could
[SPEAKER_17]: give us a better idea of what this is.
[SPEAKER_17]: It serves as a flood control system
currently because it is essentially a
[SPEAKER_17]: retention basin.
[SPEAKER_17]: It allows us to control flow downstream
with the boards as the park currently
[SPEAKER_17]: does.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it provides a unique wetland habitat.
[SPEAKER_17]: The hydrological risks are that there's
rapid deposition happening, which leads to
[SPEAKER_17]: a reduction in basin capacity.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we get used to it serving as a flood
retention basin, that might change in time
[SPEAKER_17]: if we don't control for erosion.
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally, it will mean that the
wetland gets flooded less frequently,
[SPEAKER_17]: and that can be a habitat change.
[SPEAKER_17]: So our recommendations are to perhaps
construct a channel adjacent to the
[SPEAKER_17]: wetland from the hydrological perspective.
[SPEAKER_17]: A trapezoidal cross-section is what we
recommend based on upstream
[SPEAKER_17]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to avoid erosion, we have more
detailed measurements about what the side
[SPEAKER_17]: slope ratio should be.
[SPEAKER_17]: To avoid erosion, we recommend that the
bed be lined with cobbles and shingles,
[SPEAKER_17]: so basically layered rocks, as you would
naturally see in such a stream,
[SPEAKER_17]: because they have a very high roughness
coefficient, here expressed as Manning's
[SPEAKER_17]: N, meaning that they're more resistant to
erosion.
[SPEAKER_17]: But even then, for a channel to carry the
discharge from a two-year storm without
[SPEAKER_17]: any erosion, it would have to be really,
really big.
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason for that is because erosion
naturally occurs during such storms.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure no one has seen a stream during a
very heavy storm not have some amount of
[SPEAKER_17]: sediment suspended in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are two ways to perhaps combat
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: One is through a wetland stream complex,
where we direct flow from the wetland into
[SPEAKER_17]: the channel through a permeable
embankment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we would essentially have a wetland on
one side and a channel adjacent to it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're sharing flow underneath the
surface if we make this embankment out of
[SPEAKER_17]: a permeable material.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that also provides two different
habitats.
[SPEAKER_17]: It allows for a more riparian habitat on
one side and a wetland mosaic on the other
[SPEAKER_17]: side.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll now hand it over to the methane team.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as we've already talked about a bunch,
there is a lot of sediment that has
[SPEAKER_13]: accumulated behind the dam.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of the texture of that
sediment and the amount of water behind it
[SPEAKER_13]: has led to methanogens producing a lot of
methane.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very anoxic environment underneath
the dam.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that means that, well, greenhouse
gases would normally be produced.
[SPEAKER_13]: Methane is produced in this case instead
of CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: And methane is a much more powerful
greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the water in the reservoir that the
dam has created also acts as a barrier,
[SPEAKER_13]: not allowing the methane that is created
through the sediment and the microbes in
[SPEAKER_13]: the sediment to be released.
[SPEAKER_13]: It keeps the bubbles down from the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is important to our recommendations
for the site because it depends on whether
[SPEAKER_13]: the stakeholders involved care about this
as a potential source of greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's a lot of methane that could be
released, it would probably not be wise to
[SPEAKER_13]: allow the water to drain out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to test how much methane was
being produced in the wetland.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the sites that we dredged from.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used an Ekman dredge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we took samples throughout around the
dam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to point out that these
areas, we think, have more running water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these areas have more stagnant water,
where 1, 2, and 5 were taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from each sample, we took 20 grams and
put them into airtight mason jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we pumped out the oxygen and pumped
in nitrogen to create an anoxic
[SPEAKER_06]: environment for methane to be produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: We incubated it for a week and then used
gas chromatography to measure how much
[SPEAKER_06]: methane was in the mason jars after that
one week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we enriched the samples with 2 grams
of dry cattails each to add some more
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon from the methanogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: We again took out the oxygen, replaced it
with nitrogen, incubated it for one week,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then tested how much methane was
produced in that week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jonas is going to talk about the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to use this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll run through some of the results
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the raw samples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, as Jasmine was talking
about, the enriched samples, where we had
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 grams of cattails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make it a bit more clear,
we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the methane produced in each of
the samplings down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we expected, we see a higher methane
production in enriched samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we added a substrate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of what we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Jasmine was saying as well,
sample 3 and 4, where we expect more
[SPEAKER_00]: running water running through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't expect high methane production
there with these two samples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we expected all the water to come
through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a low sedimentation there, where we
have 1, 2, and 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect there to be more sediment
depositing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanted to do was to calculate
the methane produced by the lake and the
[SPEAKER_00]: wetland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found some numbers for the sediment
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made the assumption that methane is
only produced in the top 10 centimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because below that, we don't really have
any carbon source, by the help of Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: Yabod of the Department of Natural
Resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We calculated this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a methane production per year
to be 14 to 27 kilograms a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this in perspective, we looked at
this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cow can produce around 58 to 144
kilograms of methane a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that one cow produced 2 to
10 times as much methane a year than the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake slash wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, consulting with Joe Yabod,
we looked at the global wetland emission
[SPEAKER_00]: of methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers are actually pretty low
when you look at the average wetland
[SPEAKER_00]: methane production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methane production in the wetland
slash lake wouldn't be that big of a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a concern, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not as much as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hand it over to Benthik group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went out on September 30,
and we just went to collect Benthik
[SPEAKER_03]: invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did eight downstream sites and three
sites in the lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were only able to get invertebrates
from one of those sites in the lake,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: To say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's some of us kicking into the
nets.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went out again on October 13,
just because we wanted more sampling from
[SPEAKER_03]: upstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went to four more sites off of
Comfort Road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did some sailing with Jeremy,
who's in the crowd right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just more of us in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot about invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we collected 199 invertebrate species
were identified by family.
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 families of invertebrates were
identified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are four drawings of what they
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a tipulidae, heptagenidae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did four species of fish were
identified.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to make sense of what all
this means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did an HBMI.
[SPEAKER_03]: And HBMI is essentially an invertebrate's
ability to withstand pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lower your HBMI, the less resistant
you are to pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of want your numbers to be
about as close to zero as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that kind of is indicative that
your stream is pretty not as polluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did that calculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we divided it in terms of upstream
pool, downstream pool, upstream riffle,
[SPEAKER_03]: downstream riffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our entire site is about a four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's moderately polluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's too much to be worried
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that was interesting was the
upstream pool is only about a 2.22.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't get enough data to see if
that's significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more testing should be done to see what
happened, if that's actually something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's less polluted, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then we collected all these
invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could put it on a pie chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we wanted to figure out a way to,
what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we compare these two?
[SPEAKER_03]: So OK, D1 riffle has all these species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And D1 pool, we only had this one species
of invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can we compare these two?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided to do diversity indices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was the Simpson's index.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we looked at downstream pool,
downstream riffle, and then the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: downstream system and the upstream system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our conclusions were downstream pools
were more diverse than riffles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And downstream in general was more diverse
than upstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did another diversity index
called Shannon Wiener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll essentially be looking at H.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one kind of said the opposite
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It said downstream riffles are more
diverse than pools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And upstream is more diverse than
downstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, or I suspect, that it's
probably because of how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: calculated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you notice in the denominator for
Simpson's index, it kind of doesn't give
[SPEAKER_03]: us much weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you found one species, it would be 1
minus 1, which would make the denominator
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suspect that that's probably why our
two indices don't agree on that front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll turn it over to Dustin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I reviewed some research that might be
important to consider for late training.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the paper that I reviewed was
Meta-Community Theory Meets Restoration by
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher Swan and Brian L.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brown.
[SPEAKER_10]: Meta-Community Theory considers local and
regional effects and how varying degrees
[SPEAKER_10]: of isolation along a network such as a
river can change these effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Swan and Brown used Meta-Community
Theory in their study of restored and
[SPEAKER_10]: unrestored streams to determine how local
and regional effects can affect the
[SPEAKER_10]: success of restoration.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in order to determine the isolation of
a particular river, or points along a
[SPEAKER_10]: river network, they used the Strailer
Stream Order method of classification.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is just a little picture depicting
the basics of Strailer Stream Order
[SPEAKER_10]: classification.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see that a first-order stream,
two first-order streams come together to
[SPEAKER_10]: form a second-order stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: And two second-order streams come together
to form a third-order stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: A first-order stream cannot come together
with a second-order stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: A third-order stream must be two
second-order streams to become a
[SPEAKER_10]: third-order stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Swan and Brown found that in first and
second-order streams were classified as
[SPEAKER_10]: isolated headwaters, and third and
fourth-order streams were classified as
[SPEAKER_10]: mainstream waters.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Swan and Brown found that in these
well-connected mainstream reaches,
[SPEAKER_10]: regional effects were more likely to play
a role in biodiversity of benthic
[SPEAKER_10]: invertebrates, whereas in isolated
headwaters, local effects were more likely
[SPEAKER_10]: to play a role in the biodiversity of
benthic invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does this mean for Lake Tremont?
[SPEAKER_10]: Lake Tremont, or the stream that became
Lake Tremont, was determined to be a
[SPEAKER_10]: third-order stream.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what this indicates is that regional
effects could potentially play a larger
[SPEAKER_10]: role in determining the biodiversity of
our site than local effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the dam at Lake Tremont could
potentially be impeding species dispersal
[SPEAKER_10]: at our site.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we potentially remove the dam,
it could potentially increase the
[SPEAKER_10]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one final thing that Swan and Brown
made an effort to bring out in their study
[SPEAKER_10]: is that sites like Lake Tremont should and
could be, could and should be researched
[SPEAKER_10]: to further restoration ecology's
understanding of how local and regional
[SPEAKER_10]: effects affect restoration and how we can
better restore sites like Lake Tremont.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we'll move on to Ryan and back to
your contamination hopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So relating to the benthic diversity and
overall human health, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: investigate certain types of
contamination, such as eco-contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do that, we collected six samples
along the watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected six samples along the
watershed, upstream to downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we took them back to the lab,
and to test for food contamination,
[SPEAKER_01]: we used this quantitray system,
which is essentially trays for each
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill it with 100 ml of water sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meets it with a reagent and incubate it
for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or any other coliform bacteria we're
looking for is present, it will interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with the reagent, and then it should glow
under a black light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some pictures from our
collection from various sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all of the samples lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, there's a gradient of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it wants at the end to really glow,
these are depositing, as a sediment,
[SPEAKER_01]: deposits the contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a concern because,
as you can see, the swimming areas where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's human interaction with the water
is very contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be a possible concern for
human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a conclusion, this is sort of
hinting that there needs to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: research done to where this contamination
is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a human source or if it's from
livestock, we really need to locate and
[SPEAKER_01]: pinpoint these contamination points to
prevent it in the future to protect human
[SPEAKER_01]: health and just the overall health of the
water system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So during our project, we also did
vegetation analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have three main objectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to identify the diversity within
and around the marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to identify the main cover types
within the marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also wanted to identify where the
invasive species are because I know that's
[SPEAKER_05]: a big priority for the state parks
workers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way we did this is we had 21 sites
that we did a drone flyover, as you saw at
[SPEAKER_05]: the beginning of the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at each of these sites, we collected
representative samples of soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are just a couple of photos of
us in the field doing these field sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: After we collected all these samples,
we went up to the Bailey moratorium and
[SPEAKER_05]: worked with Anna Stalter, who very kindly
helped us identify all of our samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also did nested quadrats downstream of
the marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this showed us that there's about 33
species in a six meter squared radius,
[SPEAKER_05]: which defines the understory in the forest
below the marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also did variable tree radius plots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found a total of 11 tree species.
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds pretty low, but it makes sense
because they're woody species as opposed
[SPEAKER_05]: to herbaceous species, as we did in the
nested quadrats.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from this, we calculated the percent
dominance for each species and the trees
[SPEAKER_05]: per acre for each species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So part parks cares about the most is
promptly invasive species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we identified all the different regions
where invasive species were found in the
[SPEAKER_05]: marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Japanese knotweed,
we have reed canary grass, and we have
[SPEAKER_05]: phragmites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to point out that phragmites is
pretty centralized in a localized region.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reed canary grass and Japanese
knotweed are spreading throughout the
[SPEAKER_05]: marsh, which might be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the three invasive species
we're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fallopia japonica, which is the Japanese
knotweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phragmites australis, which is phragmites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Phalaris arundinacea,
which is reed canary grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also looked at the diversity in and
throughout the marsh, as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: downstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you first look at this marsh,
you're like, it's just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: cattails.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: But in reality, we found 66 different
genera of different plant species in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually equated out to about 90
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still had some unknown,
so it's probably closer to 100 species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Downstream in our nested quadrants,
we had 33 species, as I previously
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned, and 11 species in the variable
tree radius plots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also would like to point out that as
you're going from the inlet of the wetland
[SPEAKER_05]: down towards the dam, diversity is
decreasing as you're going down,
[SPEAKER_05]: which might impact the vegetative impact
on this field site.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also realized that some trees are
starting to assist in succession of this
[SPEAKER_05]: marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the tree species that we found are
Platanus occidentalis, which is American
[SPEAKER_05]: sycamore, and Acer nigundo, which is box
elder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of the trees we found of Acer
nigundo were just little seedlings,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there were a couple mature trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took a coring from one of these
mature trees, and it aged out about 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this just demonstrates that succession
is not an immediate process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to fix our problems as
quickly as we would hope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might suggest planting some tree
species to try and help stabilize the
[SPEAKER_05]: banks with the roots, or also shade out
some of the invasives that I previously
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is where it starts getting
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we first visited our field site,
we saw this big empty field.
[SPEAKER_05]: of where there used to be Japanese
knotweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found out beavers actually had
created a knotweed dam using all this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff they had cut down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that sounds pretty crazy,
but it gets crazier.
[SPEAKER_05]: This knotweed that these beavers are
cutting down are actually water rooting,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the beavers are acting as a vector.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is them actively spreading an
invasive species, which might have a
[SPEAKER_05]: larger impact not only on our site,
but also throughout the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the state might want to look into this
a bit more, because it's obviously a big
[SPEAKER_05]: problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, when we were going through all
our drone photos, we found this
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting thing happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found some carex, which is a sedge,
just in the middle of all these cattails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're thinking this might be a native
sedge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be good if you plan on
replanting in this marsh to use this,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's obviously out competing
typha, which is a large dominant in this
[SPEAKER_05]: field site.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also low growing, so it's not
going to be taking over too many other
[SPEAKER_05]: habitats for other species.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were doing our variable tree
radius plots, we found a ground seeder,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a club moss.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually a state protected plant
in New York State.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the state needs some interesting
aspect to really sell to whoever they're
[SPEAKER_05]: working for, this is an important site.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to focus on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one aspect you can go at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in conclusion, we just want to
recommend a couple things from the
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetation aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state might want to do more fall and
spring sampling of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were very limited for this,
because we only had this fall semester to
[SPEAKER_05]: do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's many spring ephemerals and
other plants that I'm sure we missed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also suggest doing more upstream nested
quadrats and variable radius plots just to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a better understanding of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely studying the impacts beavers
are having on these invasives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly getting more funding for the
knotweed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we believe it's coming from an
upstream source, but we're not really
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using Watkins Glen as a reference site.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go into more detail about that very
soon in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And possibly identifying some important
wildlife habitat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found some different species,
like wood ducks and blackbirds,
[SPEAKER_05]: when we were doing our field work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm going to turn it over to Karen
and Daniel for soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last but not least, we're going to talk
about the soil analysis that we did on
[SPEAKER_08]: this site.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were trying to answer two primary
questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: One being, are there any issues with the
soil that can limit the plantings and
[SPEAKER_08]: recommendations we have?
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if we were to remove sediment
from the lake, is the dredge material
[SPEAKER_08]: hazardous?
[SPEAKER_08]: And if so, what can we do with it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And to answer these questions,
we're looking at both surface soil
[SPEAKER_08]: collected around Lake Treven and upstream,
and the dredge material that was mentioned
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: With surface soil, we looked at aggregate
stability, texture, active carbon,
[SPEAKER_08]: and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with the dredge material, we're
looking at heavy metals and soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our additional challenge was to do all
these tests on a small class budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: But luckily, the Cornell Soil and Health
Lab was really generous and allowed us to
[SPEAKER_08]: do a lot of these tests ourselves for
free, and then be strategic about what
[SPEAKER_08]: tests we submitted for them to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We looked at 25 different heavy metals,
some of which are shown in this chart with
[SPEAKER_08]: our five dredge samples and the list of
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we found is that the majority of
the heavy metals are pretty far below the
[SPEAKER_08]: level of concern that New York State has.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were slightly elevated levels of
nickel and zinc.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the yellow highlighted parts
there with the dredge sample 1 and 2.
[SPEAKER_08]: But both were within what we call the
rural background soil level.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you might naturally find in
upstate New York soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were also pretty far below the
level of concern for public health and
[SPEAKER_08]: aquatic health.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are things to keep an eye for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do plan on dredging or removing
sediment, we would recommend taking more
[SPEAKER_08]: samples of sediment from the lake.
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be dredge core samples or water
samples, just to verify that these numbers
[SPEAKER_08]: do represent the heavy metal content in
lake treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also acknowledging that if you're
removing the sediment and moving it
[SPEAKER_08]: elsewhere with a place with high zinc or
nickel levels, then that could be a
[SPEAKER_08]: problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: But overall, we decided that the sediment
was generally suitable for any uses and
[SPEAKER_08]: that there's not any problems right now
for public health or ecological health.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then here we just have a map of the
relative concentrations of nickel sampled
[SPEAKER_08]: in lake treatment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we especially want to show this
because this was pretty prevalent
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout all of the heavy metals where
you find the highest concentration closer
[SPEAKER_08]: to the dam, further downstream,
kind of similar to what the methane team
[SPEAKER_08]: was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's probably where you would be
removing sediment.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's important to acknowledge that
this is also where you might have a
[SPEAKER_08]: heavier concentration of heavy metals
because of the finer soils, and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: just where sediment is accumulating.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were drying out our samples,
we started to notice these crazy salt
[SPEAKER_08]: formations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were like, we're going to look into
soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: But luckily, all the samples were pretty
non-saline or only very slightly saline,
[SPEAKER_08]: which means that the sediment should be
generally safe for any plants or trees you
[SPEAKER_08]: would want to add.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then moving on to the surface soils,
we wanted to look at aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is how well soil aggregates
resist falling apart when they're hit by
[SPEAKER_08]: heavy rains.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you measure it by sifting out
aggregates of a certain size, putting it
[SPEAKER_08]: on a sieve, and then putting it under this
crazy machine, the Cornell sprinkle
[SPEAKER_08]: infiltrometer, which kind of simulates
what a standard rain fall would be for
[SPEAKER_08]: five minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all the stuff you have left is
your stable aggregates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you use that to calculate your
aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here, we have a chart of our results
and a chart that was used to score those
[SPEAKER_08]: results.
[SPEAKER_08]: And overall, we found that our soils have
pretty medium to high aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_08]: These might be slightly overestimated
because we had a heavy sand content.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in all, this suggests that there's a
pretty strong resistance to soil loss
[SPEAKER_08]: during rain events.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is pretty good for the site,
good for planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Daniel is going to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rest of our soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's set it behind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Behind.
Behind.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as far as texture, many of the soils on
this site scored similarly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much of our sand content was up here
between 90% and 60%.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot of very well-drained soils,
heavy sand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of this can have to do with some of
our sampling methodology.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we went back and had a chance to do
this again, we would be taking much deeper
[SPEAKER_11]: samples to get at not just what's left on
top, but some of the smaller particulates
[SPEAKER_11]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_11]: The active carbon.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an interesting measure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you consider the rhizosphere,
all of the bacteria that are down in the
[SPEAKER_11]: root zone trying to help the plants and
trees establish, they need active carbon
[SPEAKER_11]: for functioning.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this test uses an interesting
oxidative reaction to determine how much
[SPEAKER_11]: carbon, not just straight carbon there,
but how much is actually going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: available for reacting.
[SPEAKER_11]: We found that intuitively, given the heavy
sand content, there wasn't a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: active carbon in these samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: The sites that showed the highest
concentrations, 7, 8, 11, 18, these areas
[SPEAKER_11]: that either had standing water or areas
that were prone to deposition during
[SPEAKER_11]: flooding events.
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, there's a gradient as one
moves through the wetland.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have it oriented here, there's the
inlet over here on the left and the dam
[SPEAKER_11]: reservoir down here on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, as flow slows down, you're going
to have finer particle deposition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will help facilitate increased
active carbon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, soil, health, lab at Cornell,
excellent toll for anybody in the home
[SPEAKER_11]: garden, the 1060 soil and nutrient
analysis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally, this is going to be used for
agriculture problem solving.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have an individual mineral or
element that your soil is lacking in?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we use this to try and figure is there
anything on site that is going to derail
[SPEAKER_11]: future planting events?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are there pH concerns that might help
us?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we shift towards an ericaceous
replanting scheme or something a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit more alkaline loving?
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the nutrient analysis,
really not a whole lot to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing is too high.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing is too low.
[SPEAKER_11]: The soil will really facilitate new plant
establishment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at pH,
[SPEAKER_11]: so generally pH is going to have around
seven will be neutral.
[SPEAKER_11]: The soils that we have on site are just
above seven.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to be in that slightly
alkaline range.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not going to be planting
ericaceous things, mountain laurels,
[SPEAKER_11]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But generally, there shouldn't be a big
issue with species selection from a pH
[SPEAKER_11]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, we have the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, intuitively, high sand content.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, during soils, there's going to be a
low organic matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of soils range from 1% to 6%.
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually, one won't see these below 1%
except for in desert soils.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's sort of what's being created
there is an interesting little microbiome
[SPEAKER_11]: where the sand or all the organic matter
washes off of the sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we can see it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: These areas that have, well, 7,
8, and 11, this is a beaver camp area.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also flood deposition in that
spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So fairly high OM there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then bringing it all together,
what we tested of the dredge samples
[SPEAKER_11]: didn't throw back a lot of red flecks.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, using an ECMID dredge,
which is a quad that goes down in samples,
[SPEAKER_11]: the top couple centimeters of soil,
that lets us know recently what has
[SPEAKER_11]: happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what happened in the 60s or in the
50s?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or any kind of development in the area?
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the ways to get at that would be
to do cores and test various layers of
[SPEAKER_11]: those cores.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond that, there are almost no concerns
when it comes to plant establishment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Many things should do well on this site.
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be a gradient, of course,
of closer to the waterway, sandier soils.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to want to have things to
establish more easily.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it really shouldn't be a problem for
the site.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a great resource.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be available digitally.
[SPEAKER_11]: We used the entire way through doing our
standard operating procedures through our
[SPEAKER_11]: interpretation of data.
[SPEAKER_11]: So whether at work or at home,
if you need to do soil sampling,
[SPEAKER_11]: I suggest this resource.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an arborist at the Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is likely a self-indulgence,
because if I don't talk about trees for
[SPEAKER_11]: one presentation, I've probably done
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as replanting, there could be a lot
of things accomplished by that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it could be stream bank
stabilization, like we're seeing these
[SPEAKER_11]: willows down in the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It could also be invasive competition
strategies.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the invasives on site obligate
full sun organisms.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can establish some kind of
successful solar barrier above them,
[SPEAKER_11]: then that might be a mechanical-free
method for treating it, but over a very
[SPEAKER_11]: long term.
[SPEAKER_11]: To that end, some of the species on site
that are already doing that, you can see
[SPEAKER_11]: here, this isn't like treatment,
but it's what it could look like with a
[SPEAKER_11]: bunch of red stem dogwood.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of willows establishing on the
banks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Willows and poplars, especially,
are right in those sites.
[SPEAKER_11]: The largest trees on site right now are
the American syphilis.
[SPEAKER_11]: For some species diversity, I'm a big fan
of deciduous conifers, taxodium,
[SPEAKER_11]: the bald cypress is very common in these
kinds of habitats.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will out-compete many other woody
species given the sites constraints.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to get fun, I really liked the
medicine clay.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of the most common wetland tree
species on the North American continent up
[SPEAKER_11]: until about two and a half million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it native?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it non-native?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they do love this kind of site.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we can see, this is a stream,
and these trees have roots right in the
[SPEAKER_11]: stream, so it could be an interesting
woody addition to any kind of replanting
[SPEAKER_11]: strategy if you consider that a lot of the
downstream and current site draws are an
[SPEAKER_11]: element of tourism or an element of that
ecological experience or novelty when it
[SPEAKER_11]: comes to rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another interesting native tree,
the Kentucky coffee tree, they have lost
[SPEAKER_11]: their evolutionary seed spreaders whenever
the large arthropods, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_11]: large herbivores left the continent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're only going to find this tree
where its seeds distribute along streams,
[SPEAKER_11]: but again, very competitive in saturated
soils, it would establish well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, it's a colony forming tree.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you keep the beavers on site and they
mow a tree like this down, it will just
[SPEAKER_11]: come down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, final concern, the beavers,
it's easy to say, yeah, just remove them,
[SPEAKER_11]: but they do do a lot of the things that
one might be trying to accomplish in a
[SPEAKER_11]: wetland maintenance or wetland restoration
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They build dams, they slow flow,
they retain sediment.
[SPEAKER_11]: They also eat all the trees that you try
to plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we've seen earlier, they do have
potential vectoring of the knotweed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in summary, we looked at as many things
as we could on site.
[SPEAKER_11]: We tried to get physiological
characteristics, getting environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: issues and looking at the biotic systems.
[SPEAKER_11]: One really important ecosystem service
clearly is that there is sediment being
[SPEAKER_11]: retained.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is sediment that isn't going into
utter melt falls.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is sediment that isn't making it into
the inlet or into the lake.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a really powerful regional
benefit for a lot of shareholders.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as invasives, there's always this
dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Invasive's bad, native's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when it comes to a large site
restoration, we've seen these invasives do
[SPEAKER_11]: some potentially positive ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_11]: The filaris is retaining soil along banks
while there is that woody transition.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we immediately remove the filaris or
do we focus on some of the other things
[SPEAKER_11]: like the fragmites?
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, should the beavers go?
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be really interesting to track
some of those cut water-rooted sections of
[SPEAKER_11]: knotweed and see where they're ending up
and are they establishing on the bank as
[SPEAKER_11]: they get through the spillway.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a little bit before big decisions
have to be made, provided that the dam
[SPEAKER_11]: continues standing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, about 30 years before this,
we'll entirely silt up and we'll lose some
[SPEAKER_11]: of those sediment retention ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the other side, removal of the dam
could be really important when it comes to
[SPEAKER_11]: arthropods or other bad thicket
vertebrates who use that waterway to
[SPEAKER_11]: travel up and down.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as gathering more information,
there's a lot of resources locally to us.
[SPEAKER_11]: One that we advocate for and that we refer
to a couple times is the Watkins land
[SPEAKER_11]: site.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a couple of dams.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them now is just a successional
forest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other still has that wetland or
lake feature.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be interesting to determine
here's what we want to see in the future
[SPEAKER_11]: for lake treatment and then go to these
sites and see how those sites either
[SPEAKER_11]: accommodate or mitigate reaching those
goals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, I'll turn it over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to thank all the people
that have facilitated us completing our
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed the help of experts to help us
interpret and even do some of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done in this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all and thank you guys for
being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we threw a lot of information at
you and you probably need some time to
[SPEAKER_03]: digest, but you'll have questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are a few resources you can reach
out to before we publish our report.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, these are some cool references if
you look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll turn it over to Audrey.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have any questions,
now is the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can direct it towards individual
people, specific groups.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been doing quite a bit of work on
sediment transport and especially along
[SPEAKER_14]: Six Mile Creek.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have some problems with just looking
at off stream sources of sediment coming
[SPEAKER_14]: into the lake and not looking at the
possibility of in stream sources in Six
[SPEAKER_14]: Mile and I think in some of the other
creeks around here, but I haven't got the
[SPEAKER_14]: data.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had a period of stream degradation
for about the last 50 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: That means the stream has been cutting its
way down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because the land use has
changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, originally when everything was
forested around here, the relative input
[SPEAKER_14]: of sediment from the uplands and off
stream sources was low.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had narrow channeled white and
meandering streams.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when all was deforested and turned
into agriculture, you had tremendous input
[SPEAKER_14]: of off stream sediment, which caused the
streams to upgrade, fill in and become
[SPEAKER_14]: multi-channel and all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I didn't make that up.
[SPEAKER_14]: People are quite aware of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the areas become reforested now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: That means there's less sediment in
general coming in from off stream.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's that mean for the stream?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the stream had tried to get an
equilibrium with this tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_14]: sediment coming in, which meant it had
more energy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it has this energy, but it doesn't
have any sediment because there's a
[SPEAKER_14]: balance between energy and sediment.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what's the stream doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's removing that sediment that has been
stored in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Six Mile, well, I live in German
Crossroad and I've been monitoring the
[SPEAKER_14]: stream channel ever since 19, just after
Agnes, 1972 when we moved in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is, you know how I believe this,
but that stream channel has degraded about
[SPEAKER_14]: 14 feet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Over that period of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: They stabilized it now so that
measurements make it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's really important to get
some measurements in upstream,
[SPEAKER_14]: in buttermilk upstream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not in the gorge area where comfort road
will go, comfort and what's that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that area.
[SPEAKER_14]: But up above that, the stream is out of
the bedrock and so there it's capable of
[SPEAKER_14]: being degraded.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it could very well be like Six Mile
that a very large fraction of the sediment
[SPEAKER_14]: that's coming into Lake Truman isn't from
those.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to defend agriculture
procedures, but it isn't coming from those
[SPEAKER_14]: agricultural lands.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming from in stream degradation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I respond to that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the point of identifying the erosion
hotspots was basically based on the curve
[SPEAKER_17]: numbers in those areas.
[SPEAKER_17]: So addressing the permeability of soil in
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the actual calculation for how much
sediment is being deposited is just from
[SPEAKER_17]: elevation data.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just how high the sediment is now
relative to what it was like before the
[SPEAKER_17]: dam was constructed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's two different things.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to measure how much sediment
is being collected in the, behind the dam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's independent of where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all these soil measurements and I get
an argument with Todd Walters sometimes
[SPEAKER_14]: about going about this, but it really
doesn't do a good job on determining how
[SPEAKER_14]: much sediments coming from the stream
banks and stream degradation.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to make some measurements.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anyway, that takes time, but maybe
there are some data out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: For instance, I don't know how many
bridges go across, but the county
[SPEAKER_14]: engineers, at least in some bridges,
always measure the depth to the channel or
[SPEAKER_14]: the water surface.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's some, not the best data,
but there's some data there that could be
[SPEAKER_14]: used to determine whether or not there's
significant degradation going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Upstream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Upstream.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question for the invasive species
team.
[SPEAKER_15]: You looked carefully at beaver and the
potential impact that they may be having
[SPEAKER_15]: with Japanese knotweed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you also look for evidence of deer
browsing and how that might be impacting
[SPEAKER_15]: the species distribution?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't looking too closely at deer
interference, but we did, when we were in
[SPEAKER_05]: the field, we did see some deer prints on
what we like to call knotweed island.
[SPEAKER_05]: That image I showed you where all the
knotweed was cut down.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the beavers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is maybe some potential for deer
also browsing and interfering with some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the species composition within the marsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely something we should
look more into in the future.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we've seen deer and deer droppings
frequently as we hike that trail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another great thing that needs more
research.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just anecdotally, we have knotweed
problems.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't give a damn how much beavers are
exacerbating that problem, but it isn't
[SPEAKER_14]: going to stop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every little piece of knotweed that comes
downstream has the capability of
[SPEAKER_14]: rerouting.
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's knotweed upstream, sooner or
later there's going to be knotweed
[SPEAKER_14]: downstream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think that thinking about getting
rid of beaver because they might be
[SPEAKER_14]: transporting knotweed is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you get rid of beaver for a
different reason, but I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_14]: a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked a little bit into that and I
mentioned maybe looking for sources
[SPEAKER_05]: upstream for the knotweed to try and also
get rid of that problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just in addition to that, we're
thinking trying to minimize the more
[SPEAKER_05]: spread of it with the beavers also present
on the site.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been trying to get rid of knotweed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly wish deer would eat more of
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll eat it in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_14]: They won't eat it in the summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not an easy problem to
fix, but just giving the state different
[SPEAKER_05]: options.
[SPEAKER_16]: Find something that eats it.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's another question back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in the future of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this just a class project or is there
something that's going to carry on after
[SPEAKER_16]: this is over with?
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a class project.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like every time I've offered this class
for the past 16 years, we take on a pro
[SPEAKER_16]: bono consulting project for a local
government or nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_16]: This fits into that context very well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where it will go from here kind of remains
to be seen.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll suggest as an example.
[SPEAKER_16]: Five years ago, we looked at Spencer Lake.
[SPEAKER_16]: Spencer Lake has a low head dam,
a shorter dam, not as tall as this dam.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Corps of Engineers and State DEC
wanted the dam removed.
[SPEAKER_16]: It dated from the 1820s.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were assuming that Spencer Lake was
50 feet deep and that could pretty much
[SPEAKER_16]: wipe out the downtown portion of Spencer
had this dam failed.
[SPEAKER_16]: We did a lot of bathymetry down there and
we found that, yes, there are some ice
[SPEAKER_16]: melt pockets there that are 50 feet deep,
but upstream of the dam, there is a
[SPEAKER_16]: subsurface ridge and only about 30
centimeters of water over that ridge.
[SPEAKER_16]: Should the dam break, for example,
the likelihood of 50 feet of water times
[SPEAKER_16]: 29 acres blowing out the town of Spencer
were relatively small.
[SPEAKER_16]: The people who came to this presentation
very like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: They said, huh, who knew?
[SPEAKER_16]: They have still yet to figure out exactly
what the proper course of action should
[SPEAKER_16]: be.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're sitting next to a former student in
this class who worked on the Spencer Lake
[SPEAKER_16]: project.
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as where it will go, this will
inform state and local and perhaps even
[SPEAKER_16]: federal authorities on deciding where it
should go, where they would like it to go.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not exactly a one-off thing,
but it is a class project.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tomorrow is the last day of the semester,
so we're not kissing the project goodbye.
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be a report, a technical
report, that will hang out and continue to
[SPEAKER_16]: stimulate discussion and hopefully inform
decisions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Jim.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would like to say, build off of
that, that we would very much,
[SPEAKER_12]: as a representative of state parks,
I think we got a ton out of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had worked with Tom and with the class
to try to help inform a resource
[SPEAKER_12]: management plan for that area,
which is important for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we've got representatives from our
environmental field team here,
[SPEAKER_12]: our planning, park operations,
and invasive species as well as
[SPEAKER_12]: educational departments.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's stuff in here already that I think
we can act on that's small-scale stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: that's going to have some impact.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we feel like we've got a little bit of
a roadmap, a much greater understanding.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as far as the dam goes,
it also has some historical significance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: As an artifact of the Civilian
Conservation Corps.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have several mandates that we're
required to live up to, and having this
[SPEAKER_12]: information is going to really help us to
do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking forward to digging into
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_16]: So are there other questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a quick question for the class.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amongst all of you, did anybody strongly
feel that it should be returned to a lake?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or were some of you like, no, it's going
to stay a marsh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there any debate about where it should
go or what it should be?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the different groups were
prioritizing different aspects of the
[SPEAKER_17]: system.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it performs a variety of services.
[SPEAKER_17]: But hydrologically, for instance,
it would be nice if we could redirect flow
[SPEAKER_17]: with a little more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_17]: But then the invasives team probably found
trade-offs between what a lake does versus
[SPEAKER_17]: what a marsh does.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think overall, we think that
retaining some aspect of the marsh is
[SPEAKER_17]: definitely in every way.
[SPEAKER_16]: This, by the way, is another former
student in this class who, thank you very
[SPEAKER_16]: much for coming.
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So in terms of larger impact, these guys
do go out and actually do things.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to think that in time and
over the course of their professional
[SPEAKER_16]: careers, it does influence the way they
approach problems and things like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, thank you very much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you want to ask additional
questions, I'm sure the students would be
[SPEAKER_16]: eager and available to answer those.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
