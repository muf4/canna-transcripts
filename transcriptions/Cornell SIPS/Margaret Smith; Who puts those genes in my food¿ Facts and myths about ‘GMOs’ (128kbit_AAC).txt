[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much, Neil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll apologize right now for the fact that
I'm going to slip out right afterwards
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not only the busiest week of
my summer field season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a field corn breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So corn is pollinating my breeding nursery
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are pollinating like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also the week when the Empire
Farm Day is the big farm expo that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: on up in Seneca Falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my breeding nursery is in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farm expo is in Seneca Falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a whole week driving circles
around the lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, it's a really scenic area,
so I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get ready for the lighting tour here
on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I titled this talk, Who Put Those Genes in
My Food?
[SPEAKER_03]: facts and myths about GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a bit of a nod to a talk I gave
many years ago on this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually too appropriate enough
to a garden club.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was a ladies garden club.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very curious, very interested
and a great audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my whole talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was feeling good about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the ladies raised her hand and
just said very wistfully, I just wish I
[SPEAKER_03]: could still get a tomato without genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I ended this talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not have that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of you recognize that headline,
which you can find in a new piece that
[SPEAKER_03]: says, majority of U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers want food labeled if it contains
DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk to you about some of
those notions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what I would like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk a little bit about why I
think this topic is controversial,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think that helps us all inform
the way we talk about it with other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go through what is genetic
engineering and try to put it in context
[SPEAKER_03]: of previous genetic change in our crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about what genetic engineering
crops are out there and being grown right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll address a few of what could
be many questions and concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won't be enough time to talk about
everything, but I'll hope to hit some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that are relevant to this
particular audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why the controversy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when the first genetic engineering
crops were grown commercially,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was in the mid 1990s, so we're
talking about 20 years ago now,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the people involved, the
industry, the seed industry, as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: the breeders, said, oh, this is just a
logical extension of what plant produce of
[SPEAKER_03]: all this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trouble is most people have never
heard of a plant breeding, right?
I did not when I came to Cornell,
so that tells you something.
So there's very little kind of
understanding of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my colleagues, social scientist,
down at Rutgers, did a survey of the
[SPEAKER_03]: general public and asked this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever eaten a fruit or vegetable
that is caught in traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: crossbreeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would like to hazard a guess on what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we're going to do this as a survey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make you raise your hand for
what percentage of people you believe
[SPEAKER_03]: answered this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, general public, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: So who thinks it was 50% of us,
except now that we're eating a fruit or
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetable?
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% to 60%?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I did say 50% of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, two people look great today.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% to 60%?
[SPEAKER_03]: 60% to 70%?
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 days?
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 to 90?
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 90% of you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you guys are pessimistic.
OK.
This is how the answers came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about two thirds of the people said no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another 11% were not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little over a quarter said yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this audience would recognize that the
answers should look like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole line there is simply to make
it clear that that's not just a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pie chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to acknowledge that it's possible
that there are some people who are eating
[SPEAKER_03]: all their fruits and vegetables by
gathering from the wild, but rather
[SPEAKER_03]: unlikely, unless you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost everything you have eaten,
of course, is a product of traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: crossbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to tell people, this is just what plant
breeders have done all along, did not
[SPEAKER_03]: really help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It let them say, who?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did they think we'd find?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would add to that that for the most
part, the genetic engineering cops that
[SPEAKER_03]: are out there don't necessarily offer
clear easily recognizable benefits to
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers, perhaps to producers,
perhaps to the environment.
But to consumers, it's another piece of
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing that would advantage them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like any technology, we have concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some portion of the population will always
have concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is genetic engineering?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a new tool for breeding improved
crops, which is a process that dates back
[SPEAKER_03]: to domestication.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is when humans first began.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some years ago, tinkering with
the genetics of the crops we grow by
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing which seeds to save.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, rare men loved the early
breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, we still do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to go to the nursery and do
exactly the same thing these guys did in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some augmented by that thing, which is the
genie gun, a way to do genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one of the best ways I can think of
to illustrate what that difference means
[SPEAKER_03]: was something that a colleague at the
University of Wisconsin put together,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are these images of James Dean House
of Wisconsin art from the mid 1600s and
[SPEAKER_03]: current day fruits or vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we looked at these old still life
paintings, the Dutch masters in the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is what a watermelon looked like in
mid 1600s on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the right, of course, is a
watermelon map.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you ask, well, he says, so is this
genetically engineered?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone says, oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, in fact, simply a product of
selection and breeding, traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one would you rather eat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to put this in context, yes,
it is a new tool for breeding fruit crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: but overlaid on the context of profound
change that humans have brought about in
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics of the crops we use for food,
feed, fuel, fire, and beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that new tool is a way to change the
properties of an organism by moving genes
[SPEAKER_03]: between organisms or actually changing a
gene that already exists, but in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that does not require sexual cross
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually a traditional corn
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go out and cross my corn with my corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go out to my nursery this afternoon
and pour bacteria on the corn soles,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I will get nothing from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic engineering allows me to bypass
that cross compatibility barrier to pull a
[SPEAKER_03]: gene from a bacterium and conceivably put
it in a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do the quick review of genetic
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA, the oxyribonucleic acid, is the code
book where all of the information,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to be you, or I need to be me,
or a corn needs to be a corn installed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It controls the structure of the organism
as well as when those products are
[SPEAKER_03]: produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a code essentially written in four
letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four base pairs that form the
core of this DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: We abbreviate them ATG and C.
[SPEAKER_03]: And amazingly enough, that four letter
code does provide in every cell of your
[SPEAKER_03]: body all the instructions for what you
need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every cell of your body contains a
complete copy of that code.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that little set of 23 molecules of
DNA are all the instructions for how to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a human.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow, reproduce, thrive, give toxic
chloroculture conferences, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: and shockingly enough to me, now you can
tell I'm clued to medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: This code is universal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A four letter code that can code for how
to be a yeast, or a vitamin, or a human,
[SPEAKER_03]: or a sequoia tree, or a whale,
or a virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single organism uses essentially the
same code.
[SPEAKER_03]: That universality is why genetic
engineering works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone could take a gene from that
bacteria and plunk it into a soybean
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the soybean plant, it's just more
ATGs and Cs, more instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as the machinery that reads the genetic
code of the soybean plant comes to that
[SPEAKER_03]: gene, it doesn't say, oops, here's
something from a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it sees is more instructions written
in the same code it recognizes anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be as if Neil were writing a
piece of literature and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this flower is rather dull.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he thought that doesn't sound dramatic
enough, so he cut out a piece that said,
[SPEAKER_03]: exceedingly dull when pasted in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next person that meets that is not
going to say, oh, look, Neil tinkered with
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look like it was written
that way all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, to quick review traditional
cross-breeding, we cross two parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: The offspring, like their kids,
have a mix of traits from the two parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic engineering, the big challenge in
some ways is to find an actual gene that
[SPEAKER_03]: would be useful to have in a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then by a rather complex process,
you stick that gene into your plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: along with some sequences that make sure
it gets expressed where you want it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a genetically engineered plant has one
or a few genes added to a particular
[SPEAKER_03]: parent, as opposed to being a mix of the
two parents that were crossed to make a
[SPEAKER_03]: traditionally cross-breed plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So genetic modification for humans go all
the way back to domestication.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is its wild ancestor, Teosinte.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very similar looking, are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers all over the world selected
different types out of that organism,
[SPEAKER_03]: babies, to fit their particular dishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this set.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are things we think of as completely
different vegetables, broccoli,
[SPEAKER_03]: cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, cabbage,
Brussels sprouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all trace back to exactly the same
ancestral mustard plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different people in different places
selected for different edible plant parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more you got of that, the more
different they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they selected the larger and larger,
lateral heads, or leaves, or stems,
[SPEAKER_03]: or lateral buds, like the Brussels
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, traditional cross-breeding
and genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say humans have profoundly altered
the genetics of our crops for thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: years, this is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from farmers choosing to save
seed, to farmers selecting and saving seed
[SPEAKER_03]: out of cultivated crops, to breeding
that's gone on for 150 years, to genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the genetic engineering crops
that are out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Three big categories and a few more newer
and less commonly grown ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, the BT crops, which have a gene
from what you probably all recognize as a
[SPEAKER_03]: bacterially developed insecticide,
Bacillus thuringiensis, sold as therside
[SPEAKER_03]: and a number of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gene that produces a protein that
inside an insect alkaline gut is converted
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of into a toxin, was removed from the
bacteria and put into some of these crops
[SPEAKER_03]: to make them insect resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can eat the crop, you're fine,
because you have an acid gut, so do all
[SPEAKER_03]: mammals and birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain insects only eat it, they consume
that protein, the gene produces and it
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes a toxin in that alkaline gut
environment, and that is what controls the
[SPEAKER_03]: insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second big category, the herbicide
resistant crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these are not that great or
resistant to life-safe, although there are
[SPEAKER_03]: other herbicide resistances coming along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is a gene from a naturally
occurring soil bacteria that allows the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to detoxify an herbicide that would
otherwise be toxic to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third big category, the virus
resistant crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Papaya and squash are the two that I know
of, this is genetic engineered virus
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant papaya, and this is the papaya
that is not resistant, so you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: quite effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is created by taking the gene
that makes the protein coat of the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: A virus is a protein coat with a little
piece of genetic material inside it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that genetic material is one gene
that produces the protein so the virus can
[SPEAKER_03]: make itself a coat, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the gene through the coat,
not the genes that cause the plant to get
[SPEAKER_03]: diseased, you build it into the plant,
and it acts essentially like what we do
[SPEAKER_03]: when we get vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It essentially vaccinates the plant
against infection by that virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plant produces both proteins for
virus, but in virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few more recently approved,
the best that I wanted to talk about,
[SPEAKER_03]: those three, the Bt and the insect and the
herbicide resistance and the virus
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant has been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: More recently, we have new herbicide
colonists, I'll talk about why in a
[SPEAKER_03]: moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have reduced lignin alpaca,
so this crop was developed to increase its
[SPEAKER_03]: digestibility as feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the potato that's been engineered
for less of this black spot bruise over
[SPEAKER_03]: here, less acrylamide production and
lake-like resistance, several versions of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the non-rounding apple,
this one, the arctic apple, which you can
[SPEAKER_03]: cut and it doesn't turn red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now notice that these, the reduced lignin
alpaca, the potato and the apple,
[SPEAKER_03]: these are really some of the first traits
that strike you as something directed at
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer quality, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The black spot bruise, kind of a consumer
issue, the acrylamide production in the
[SPEAKER_03]: potato, absolutely a consumer issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The non-rounding apple, more appealing to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reduced lignin alpaca,
the consumers, in that case, are packed.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all traditional genetic
engineers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even hit CRISPR yet and I'm not
sure I'll have time to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll try to be fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk to this audience
particularly about vegetables,
[SPEAKER_03]: fruits and ornamentals, because a lot of
this is in the field crops, are we not?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there have been a series of approvals,
so when you get approval to commercialize
[SPEAKER_03]: a genetically engineered version of a
crop, you need to get approval from three
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USDA, US Department of Agriculture,
in order to be sure that there's not a new
[SPEAKER_03]: pest problem created by that crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Environmental Protection Agency,
which has to do things like label
[SPEAKER_03]: lactose-A for use on crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would normally kill, but they're the
genetically engineered resistant ones,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the EPA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Food and Drug Administration,
which is responsible for food and feed
[SPEAKER_03]: safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you've got those three approvals,
you get what's called deregulation or
[SPEAKER_03]: approval to commercialize that crop
without special regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are, starting in 1992,
all the approvals, it's just the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: approvals in a given year for things which
would be considered vegetable,
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit or ornamental.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a big state early on with
tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor saver tomato was actually the
first genetically engineered crop and lots
[SPEAKER_03]: of different versions of it were approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were a few squashes here,
those virus-resistant squashes,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few potatoes here, the papaya,
the virus-resistant papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had kind of a desert here,
until pox-resistant plum, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Another papaya patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one right here is the blue rose,
which has been approved, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another recent, this is 2014 to
2017, a recent collection that includes
[SPEAKER_03]: that new version of the potato,
with reduced acrylamide, black spot brews
[SPEAKER_03]: and the lake-like resistance, as well as
the new arctic aloe, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: To put that in context, I've put some
stars on this picture and what the stars
[SPEAKER_03]: represent is the numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the numbers for vegetable,
fruit and ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stars are the numbers for field crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see they tracked fairly
similarly here at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then where the things that are more
directly tied to consumers, vegetables,
[SPEAKER_03]: fruits, and ornamentals dropped right off,
we still had a lot of field crops
[SPEAKER_03]: activity, really a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're sort of catching up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the public response caused the
people that are producing fruit and
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables and less so ornamentals,
I think there's just enough work there,
[SPEAKER_03]: to back off from this technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because after all, we don't think of
ourselves as eating corn or canola or
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa or cotton, but we sure know we eat
potatoes and carrots and peppers and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the consumer response from the
fruit and vegetable industry back off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have about 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that 10 minutes, I'm gonna try and
run through some questions and concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of estimates and the
estimates vary dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you talk to people from the really
large seed industry, they will give you
[SPEAKER_03]: estimates that include millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talk to Okanagan specialty fruit,
they develop the Arctic apple,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a very tiny company in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a US approval and then tell you
the number that's in the tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So exploring depends on how you approach
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a fair amount of paperwork
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not, there's no world in which
it's cheap and easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will say this about CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CRISPR is a technology for bringing
about genetic change in a much more
[SPEAKER_03]: targeted way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the two things it lets you do
differently from traditional genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering, which is cutting the gene out
of this and sticking it in that basically
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere at random.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hoping to find one where you didn't
randomly disrupt genes the plant needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: CRISPR allows you to target exactly where
in the genetic material that crop you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then either do one of two things,
create random change at that spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you identify perhaps, we'll use an
example I just heard about this morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you, flower color.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we know a lot about the genes
that produce colors in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could target that portion of a gene
that causes a plant to have a particular
[SPEAKER_03]: or a flower have a particular color and
create random changes in that gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them would probably give you
flowers that look like mud, but every once
[SPEAKER_03]: in a while you might get one that has a
really cool new color.
[SPEAKER_03]: That process, creating random change,
is exactly what's happening in all of us
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time called mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have many, many mutations because
every time your cells divide, your body
[SPEAKER_03]: has to copy your entire genetic
co-relative so each cell gets a copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you, but when I make
copies of long things, there are always
[SPEAKER_03]: mistakes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing happens with the genetic
machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes occasional mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the source ultimately of all the
variation we have within species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why all of us in this room don't look
identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have many small genetic differences
from each other and those trace back to
[SPEAKER_03]: copying mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of those are not useful, but through
CRISPR you can create a faster rate of
[SPEAKER_03]: copying mistakes in a particular gene,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing you can do with CRISPR is
a mirror image of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cause a break in a particular part
of the DNA, but then give the plant a
[SPEAKER_03]: template that includes a new gene so that
when it repairs that break it incorporates
[SPEAKER_03]: the new gene, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So CRISPR can be used to do genetic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can also be used to create random
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: The random change part, there is nothing
you can measure on those plants that will
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you this was a result of doing CRISPR
versus waiting around for a mutation to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the agencies that regulate this
technology are trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing they can do to actually
look at a plant and verify whether it was
[SPEAKER_03]: a product of CRISPR gene mutation or just
next to gene mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far the very first products of CRISPR
are just emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not sure if that's going to be
related to GMO or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USDA is struggling, reworking their
regulations right now and that is a key
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European Union just this past,
within the past week decided that yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: CRISPR is going to be regulated as
genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So different places have different
regulations and they are all struggling
[SPEAKER_03]: with how to handle that technology right
now.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing commercialized is genetically
engineered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, people are very quick to say oh
it's all those GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of my point was showing you the
list was there are not that many products
[SPEAKER_03]: and in the world of fruits and vegetables,
sweet corn, green and yellow, summer
[SPEAKER_03]: squash, papaya, what am I forgetting
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomato, there are no current genetic
engineered tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were approved and then they were
pulled from market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor saver was a great tomato,
but they did the genetic engineering on
[SPEAKER_03]: the tomato that didn't taste very good and
didn't really work for growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sort of forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the one gene ready right and then
they started planting other genes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato that also need to work for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They forgot that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's one of the things that people
are debating now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be more acceptable to people if
you just use, for example, a CRISPR to
[SPEAKER_03]: create variation within the species rather
than reaching beyond those boundaries?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my own sense is there are people
for whom that will be reassuring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I'm accidentally consuming
something from a bacteria when I thought I
[SPEAKER_03]: was just eating food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind that in nature that does happen
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bacteria and viruses, as we know,
can insert their genetic material into UV
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't think it worked that well
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there are people who would be
reassured by that and then there are
[SPEAKER_03]: people who will just think, oh,
now they're taking this technology I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't like and they're putting it in
products where I can't even tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even more clandestine than it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're quite sure how that will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to say I'm happy to keep
answering questions at this point if that
[SPEAKER_03]: works for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if the bee team crops are
affecting the bee population?
[SPEAKER_03]: The bee population?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bees are not one of the insects that is
affected by the Bacillus naringensis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So consequently, that protein doesn't
really affect bees either.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the reasons people really
like it, both as an organic insecticide,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a conventional insecticide,
and as a genetically engineered trait,
[SPEAKER_03]: is its action spectrum is pretty narrowly
confined to the letter documents,
[SPEAKER_03]: the capillaries, and the beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And different PTs work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work differentially well on
particular species of caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_03]: beetles as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see Bill and now I'm talking to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to respect him a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I was wondering about is
there's a great lack of understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this and there's a lot of emotion
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what does Cornell do to address
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think at Cornell, we have people
who are absolutely pro-GMO and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of people who are probably
absolutely against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we can all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does Cornell have programs that
interpret this and extend it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can you comment on those issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a variety of people around
Cornell who do speaking, publishing,
[SPEAKER_03]: educating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our role is educational.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sort of see our role as to help
people understand the technology and what
[SPEAKER_03]: both its risks and its benefits and its
risks are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are a lot of people who will
talk about only one or only the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our job is not to pick sides, but to help
people understand it so they can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: better informed choice of their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other thing that is part of
our responsibility here is to be as
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughtful as we can about where the
hazards might lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I say that as scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes back to me because again,
I was speaking to an audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was up in Canada about
genetically engineered crops and food
[SPEAKER_03]: safety, which is always a big concern to
people since I'm not going to get to those
[SPEAKER_03]: slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say right now that
scientifically, there's no evidence of any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the commercialized genetically
engineered crops having risks related to
[SPEAKER_03]: food repeat safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one that Rose put her hand up,
raised her hand at the end and then said,
[SPEAKER_03]: so how do we know this isn't the next
transept?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really good question because
we've had a history of many examples of
[SPEAKER_03]: things that were developed because people
fully believed they were going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: better for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the ozone layer?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't hear a lot of CFCs were
destroying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just knew they were really good at
refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes things take time to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just say as scientists,
it's also our obligation to have a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: degree of humility and a huge degree of
forethoughtfulness to see as best we can
[SPEAKER_03]: where the problems might lie and try to
keep on top of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, you should also know,
nobody funds research that will examine
[SPEAKER_03]: unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are never going to get that kind of
funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how to do that in a practical sense is
not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the FDA in their examination of
data looks quite carefully at potential
[SPEAKER_03]: allergenicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know a fair amount about that
because we know with major allergens,
[SPEAKER_03]: we sort of know what kind of structures
and families of chemicals have a tendency
[SPEAKER_03]: to be allergenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing they do is they always
look at data for in vitrip, so in a petri
[SPEAKER_03]: dish, ready to break down with human
digestive enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the argument there is if it breaks
down any more slowly than any other normal
[SPEAKER_03]: protein that you would find, that's a red
flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simply because the longer something is in
your digestive system, the more chance you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to have any kind of a reaction to it,
whether it's allergenic or just irritable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things that break down any more slowly
get red flagged, and they will not be
[SPEAKER_03]: approved until that is examined and
understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The abrogenicity question, I think,
is handled probably the best we can with
[SPEAKER_03]: that because the only way to really know
that there is no human on the planet who
[SPEAKER_03]: would have an allergic reaction is to test
every human because we are all different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not practical, but looking at
some range of human digestive enzymes and
[SPEAKER_03]: how quickly things break down is probably
the best approach we can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I see him all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me ask, when you say you get to a
sterile, in my world we don't get to
[SPEAKER_03]: steriles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's an ornamental thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do get to hybrids that don't
propagate true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say the seed is inappropriate to
mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are also steriles,
particularly in an ornamental's world,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they flower more.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're desperately trying to exceed,
so they just keep flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said you can read to steriles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's genetically controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sterile traits are genetically
controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could absolutely, both by reading
or by genetic engineering, change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't yet have a good way of thinking
hybrids bring true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangely enough, the seed industry
doesn't do a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of us don't have a big research
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's you, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably not perhaps your area of
expertise, but in ornamentals that no one
[SPEAKER_01]: eats, but the potential here to develop
new colors, new shapes, new all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to say disease for insect
existence, but yes, there is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the whole thing, the reason people
buy plants is because their appearance or
color.
And that's what gives them value.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do a lot of different things,
potentially, with genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, consumers buy them if they know
they're genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you guys could probably answer
that better than I can.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how to answer that
question until someone gets something
[SPEAKER_03]: approved that they actually want to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding of the blue rose is that
it isn't really that great a color,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so it really hasn't taken off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would also say that there's a lot of
scope for breeding lots of different
[SPEAKER_03]: colors through traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would finally say, I'm surprised the
marketer didn't keep you under the table,
[SPEAKER_03]: because insects and plants and plant
pathogens love to eat dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not good objects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I commend that John's question a little
bit, that we get a lot of questions in the
[SPEAKER_02]: retail level about organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get it so much with flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it a lot, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But very few people actually seem to care,
based on the questions that we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, that they're geraniums or
they're
[SPEAKER_02]: marital questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might work the same with genetic
engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, by the way, think that
organic, that they confuse the terms all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is confusing, because if it's,
so here's the intersection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is certified as organic,
it must be drawn from a non-genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering variety, along with many other
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that it's not genetic
engineering, it's just not all organic and
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other way doesn't quite work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of terms out there,
and they're confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, it doesn't surprise me
that people are more concerned about what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're putting in their maths than what
they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're looking at in their front
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want for beauty, but it's not going
to affect their health unless they're
[SPEAKER_03]: planting red weavers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's perhaps not a surprising
reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's made me wonder for a long time
about genetic engineering and ornamentals,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think that would be an area
where there would be less concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original critical concept was in
ornamental.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pine tree, and they engineered it
with, it never was marketed, it never even
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily got to a plant, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they engineered it with a gene from
the firefly, the luciferase gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the luciferase gene in the firefly
has the right chemical to work on,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will produce lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they built that gene into the pine
tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you watered it with the right
chemical, luciferin, the tree would light
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually the original critical
concept of genetic engineering.
The market's not there.
Just like with pesticides, how ag is
always the chemical's crunch, and we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: get ag four billion, we're going to spend
a billion dollars to develop a new
[SPEAKER_05]: plutonium because we're not going to get a
return on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the money's not there, so that's why
it's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not be right, I will say,
in closing, the USDA at least is
[SPEAKER_03]: re-evaluating and getting comments on
their regulatory approval process right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least that process they're hoping to
streamline, that doesn't reduce what the
[SPEAKER_03]: cost of the actual genetic engineering is,
which is, it's not $10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, CRISPR's getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's getting cheaper, but there's the
registration cost, so there's the
[SPEAKER_05]: development cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so those aren't going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the new technology, the CRISPR that
they're so interested in, will probably
[SPEAKER_03]: make the cost of the genetic change part
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's only the other breeding,
the other 30,000 genes in the plant.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
