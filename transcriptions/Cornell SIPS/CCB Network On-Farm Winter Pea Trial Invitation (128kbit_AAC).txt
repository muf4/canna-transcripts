[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Solveig Hansen and I'm
coordinator for the cover crop breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here at one of Cornell University's
research farms at our winter pea nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about six years, the cover crop
breeding network has been breeding winter
[SPEAKER_01]: peas for cover crop use, which means
reliable winter survival, strong spring
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor and high biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter pea breeding starts here in
breeding nurseries where we select the
[SPEAKER_01]: best individual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter pea breeding continues here.
[SPEAKER_01]: and our advanced line trial fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past six years, we've trialed
winter peas in about 50 different
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best of our breeding lines are moving
toward commercial availability,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've also identified some excellent
commercially available cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, if you live in hardiness zones
three through six, so a place with a cold
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, we're inviting you to join our
winter pea trialing efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you participate, you receive enough
seed to sow about a 15-foot row of four
[SPEAKER_01]: different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ask you to photograph and rate the
plots three times during the season using
[SPEAKER_01]: an app called Seedlinked, which is
designed for collaborative variety
[SPEAKER_01]: trialing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ask you to rate for traits like
emergence, vigor, winter hardiness and
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops are essential for soil health,
but they can also be delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be working with the Stone Barn
Center for Food and Agriculture and Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill of Stone Barns to learn about
evaluating flavor in winter peas with tips
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two main traits that we're
going to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the overall enjoyment of these
peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetness, earthiness, one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is very unpleasant, never try it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, five is I would seek this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite salad tree ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you join us this fall in trialing
winter pea cover crop varieties on your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm or in your garden.
