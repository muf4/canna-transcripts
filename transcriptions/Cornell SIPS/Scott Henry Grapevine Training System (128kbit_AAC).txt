[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Scott Henry Training System
and we've probably talked about this in
[SPEAKER_02]: class.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we call a dynamic training
system, which means we have to do an
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustment during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got four canes, one, two,
three, four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we position the lower
tier downwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we looked at the double geo,
we've got four canes, but everything grows
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Scott Henry system, the top grows
up and you can actually see this is what a
[SPEAKER_02]: machine harvested or mechanically
harvested block looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see what's left here in terms
of where the fruit was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a fruiting zone up at the top
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a bit of a space and then we
have a lower fruiting zone here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these shoots are actually positioned
downwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we come along just after a berry
set and flip this wire downwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're growing up, then we flip it
down and pull these shoots down.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, the growth along the bottom
isn't always very good, but it gives us
[SPEAKER_02]: this space here in the training system
that allows for more light and more
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something growers don't always
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extra work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the studies that have been done
usually show that this can improve yield
[SPEAKER_02]: while either maintaining or improving
fruit composition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really good system that many
growers need to consider using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to prune this Scott Henry
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get us down to four canes,
two that go out here and two that grow out
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just looking at this to figure
out what I was going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, I don't want to use bull
wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bull wood is something that's big in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has long spaces or long internodes
between the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I looked at this shoot right here
and I thought, oh, that's bull wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, okay, where am I going to
cut this out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to look and then I realized,
hold on, it's not from this vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes up as if it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's pull this out because it's crazy
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how long it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even from this vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not from the neighboring vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually comes from two vines over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an absolutely crazy amount of
bull wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this has got to be 50 feet or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you do not want to see in
your vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting rid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to cut away some of the extra
stuff so that we can figure out exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're going to use here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start with the lower tier first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, we want to keep everything
close to the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we don't get a space where we're
not going to have fruit production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a cane here that's kind of
gray at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's probably not going to be
very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really not a good option for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones here are too far out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll cut those right out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leaves this one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to see what else we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the bottom tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a possibility, but it's a
little bit big with long internodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to use that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to simplify here, we're going to cut
this out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at what we have here,
I'm actually seeing a possibility for a
[SPEAKER_02]: cane that could go along this wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I stretch this one out, I've got all
of these buds along here that are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if I use this one, I'm going to
have this space here that doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'll use this cane to go in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then along this side, this one doesn't
look too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like it to be a little more brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little gray through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be my best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: For laying out in that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to use these two canes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut this out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be my first cane along
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll wrap it for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd come back with these cane ties that
we use and actually tie these into place a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit later in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for here, I think I'm going to use this
cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little gray towards the end,
but we're running into this vine anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then what I can do is get rid of this
whole thing through here, because I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to use anything that comes from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to cut this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'll cut it right down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, it looks like it's a root
sucker anyway, because here is our graft
[SPEAKER_02]: union.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the bulge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually not coming from the
graft union.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone should never have tied this one up
anyway, because it could be rootstock
[SPEAKER_02]: material rather than fruiting wood or
scion wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a cane that goes this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut some of this extra stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a plane that ties out in this
direction here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get rid of our old one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from the neighboring vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cut that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that comes from the neighboring vine as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's our two cones for our lower
tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upper tier, it looks like we've got a
little bit more choice here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either of these two shoots right here are
probably a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one might lay out there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll cut the rest of this older cane
off to get it out of the way so I can see
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cleared out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along here, I know I'm not going to
use anything past this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get that out of the way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's tied in there pretty good with a
cane tie that I'm going to pull off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of vigor in this block,
which is why we have some overlap from
[SPEAKER_02]: neighboring vines here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we needed more space to lay out
more buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this allows me to look at what's really
good here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nice, nice brown wood,
but it's just too big in diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely some bull wood there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty useless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll cut that right out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just damaged that cane a little bit as I
pulled the other piece out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably still going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good option still.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is probably an even better option.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit smaller in diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have to worry about that
little piece of bark I just pulled off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to keep that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the neighboring vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: As is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just hit myself in the face with a
cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one we're going to tie out this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got this one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got what we call a persistent lateral
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get rid of that
persistent lateral.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can leave an extra bud there if we want
to make sure we get something in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's pretty long anyway,
so I'll probably cut right about there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is how I would cane prune this
Scott Henry system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll come back with some cane ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tie those down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my four cones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave that as a renewal spur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vine's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to go once we tie it down.
