[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Emily.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a fifth year now and I came here
straight out of my undergrad, which I did
[SPEAKER_05]: at the University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to UC Berkeley, did a little bit of
research there, but actually spent two
[SPEAKER_01]: years at a medical school as a lab tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Katie, I went to the University of
Florida and I did a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_03]: volunteering slash field tech gigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically wound up taking three years
off by doing real work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I did before coming here
was supervising field teams, which was a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Kara.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a first year PhD student in entomology
department.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Yale as an undergrad and did
various summer research projects through
[SPEAKER_04]: fellowships that I got through the
college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I went on to a master's of public
health there afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I took a year off of academia and
worked on ranches in Wyoming and
[SPEAKER_04]: Argentina.
[SPEAKER_04]: During that time I also applied to Cornell
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone, I'm Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my undergrad at the University of
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did research at the University of Puerto
Rico and summer researching Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Angie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm originally from Colombia and I have a
long path in academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an undergrad in that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are required to have a research project
at the end of the program, so I present a
[SPEAKER_02]: thesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I work in a research institute in
Columbia too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I did my master's in the University
of Puerto Rico, Maja West.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I worked as a lab manager at Duke
University in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to do today is go through
these different sections of the CV.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we want to emphasize that
there's no real hard and fast rules to
[SPEAKER_01]: writing a CV, but these are some ways that
you can organize it that I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people agree are some of the better ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off with just your education
section, which is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should include just where you did your
undergraduate, what your major was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you want to you can put your GPA,
if you want to show off your GPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely don't need to put it up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an easy way for someone to see if you
happen to have a very good GPA right away,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'll have your transcripts and
stuff too, so you don't need to put it up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a nice place to put if you have
any kind of honors or something like that
when you graduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some institutions really emphasize the
GREs when you're applying to grad school.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did really well in GRE and you want
to highlight that right away, you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: that one under your education section.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of programs really emphasize the
GRE, but that's kind of an institution by
[SPEAKER_01]: institution thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next section, which some people
have and some people don't, but it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of nice to orient what you're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this kind of research interest
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that section you would put a really
short summary of what you're interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it can even be just keywords of
topics that you're really interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what kind of career goals or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, it's a very short section and
also definitely optional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
research experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have some overlap with your
statement of purpose, because you already
[SPEAKER_02]: know a lot about that statement of
purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your CV, you want at least the main
things that you have learned during your
[SPEAKER_02]: research experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing, if you don't have any
research experience right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this section, it's important to keep in
mind the skills that you're gaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to make this a very long
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you don't want to overlap or be
abundant with your SOP, because you are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be more abundant there about this
part.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Publications and presentations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on how many you have,
they can be separate sections.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, mine still just wants sections
both put together.
[SPEAKER_05]: For publications, you can include any
peer-reviewed or published publications.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can also include thesis if they are
archived in an online through your
[SPEAKER_05]: university or local institution.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they are readily accessible,
somebody can search it and find it online
[SPEAKER_05]: and read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put it in the publication section.
[SPEAKER_05]: For presentations, that would be any
symposiums or conferences you've gone to,
[SPEAKER_05]: either it's just at your institution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Posters and oral presentations both count.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, when you actually put
them on your CV, make sure you're
[SPEAKER_05]: following citation guidelines and you keep
it consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick one and then stick with it the whole
way through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you cite a poster or
presentation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, if you're going to be very
organic, you're going to have all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: She asked how you cite for a poster or
presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that I've done it is that I put
the title of the poster or presentation,
[SPEAKER_05]: what conference it was, and then where the
conference was, and also the date of the
conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know, we're going to be
repeating the questions back to you for
[SPEAKER_03]: the sake of the recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because we think you're
hard-of-hearing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: How far should faculty go if you give
every single one you've ever given,
[SPEAKER_06]: or do you only give the one that's
relevant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: She asked how far back you should go in
terms of putting publications on your CV.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to depend on the
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a lot of publications,
you might not want to put the ones from
[SPEAKER_05]: 2007 that aren't necessarily relevant for
what you want to do moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have two or three, you could
put them all in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it depends on what the CV is
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the grad schools ask for a
two-page CV, so it's more like a resume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you'd have to narrow it down to
fit it all in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you might just want to select the
most relevant ones to the type of research
[SPEAKER_04]: you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's a true CV, then it's really
everything you've ever done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you should have everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar to that, how would you go about
citing, say you did the same poster,
[SPEAKER_06]: do you put every single conference,
or do you summarize it all in one section?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can answer that because I presented the
same undergrad research poster like four
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I've gotten more and more concise
over the years, and I think concise is
[SPEAKER_03]: generally better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might list the title if it's
basically the same across conferences,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you change a couple of words,
but it's still essentially the same
[SPEAKER_03]: poster, just pick a title, and then list
the locations and the years of those
[SPEAKER_03]: different conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a thing to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I usually keep a copy of my
full resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're applying to any position,
you make it concise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very specific to the position that
you're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a copy in your computer with
everything that you have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find that there's a lot of variation
between schools, what they're asking in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of resumes or CVs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the work that is started
at the very beginning when you emailed the
[SPEAKER_02]: professor to start the contact,
there you need to basically show as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as you've done, and whatever is relevant
for this professor is what you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have their resume with
everything that you have done,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just copy and paste or delete
some reduced version for the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to highlight what you want to show to
that professor you are contacting at that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little variation,
but if you have a long research
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, it's better to show that
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to put every poster or
every talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to go maybe the most
prestigious conference that you have done,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can start sometimes people like to
see the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she started doing research 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to emphasize that you have
been consistent in a long history of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: your research, and you can highlight just
maybe the most prestigious or the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you think had most of the data or
something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so next I'm going to be talking
about two more sections of teaching
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and volunteer and
extracurricular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of for context, these are
important to grad schools.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, a common way of funding
students is through TAships.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can show that you have some sort
of experience or skill in teaching,
[SPEAKER_04]: then that might be looked well upon in the
application process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've been an undergraduate TA,
that's definitely something you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to want to put into your CV for your
application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you've done any sort of tutoring,
whether it's at college level or even if
[SPEAKER_04]: you've tutored younger children,
that shows that you have experience
[SPEAKER_04]: teaching someone and can explain concepts
in a way that's understandable to others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for your volunteer and
extracurricular experience, one important
[SPEAKER_04]: thing is to highlight any leadership roles
or managerial roles you've had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you've been in the club for all
four years and you've just been president
[SPEAKER_04]: this past year or something, you're going
to want to put that up front in your
[SPEAKER_04]: description of that topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe highlighting your president role
in the title or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just emphasize those so whoever's
looking at it can know that you have this
[SPEAKER_04]: experience leading others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to want to be selective
and succinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking with some of you guys,
it sounds like you've done a million and
[SPEAKER_04]: one things and that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you aren't going to have all that for
a two-page CV.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to want to choose what's
most relevant or what you feel most
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate about, what you've spent the
most time on, if you're feeling like
[SPEAKER_04]: you're pressed for space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better to elaborate on the things that you
care about or have done a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: with than to list something you did maybe
one day, one year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so you can use this to support
other sections of your resume,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you don't want to be redundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if you volunteered in a
lab, you're going to want to put that
[SPEAKER_04]: under research experience, not under your
volunteer experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, the I's are going to care
more about your research experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably where the I's are going
to go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have that experience,
even if it's volunteer and not paid,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to want to put that in your
research experience to highlight it more
[SPEAKER_04]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then don't repeat it in the volunteer
section.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so I mean, I guess it is
important if you have done any volunteer
[SPEAKER_04]: or extracurricular experience to add that
in, because just like your applications
[SPEAKER_04]: for undergrad, grad schools care that
you're going to add something to the
[SPEAKER_04]: community and make it a more vibrant
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, for example, all the students
here working on this, it's because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: people who care and they are active and
engaged in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can show you're going to be that
type of person when you come to school,
[SPEAKER_04]: then that's going to add something to the
grad community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the grad schools are going to want you
more for that type of personality trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So say you're helping refugee families
learn English, that would be something
[SPEAKER_06]: that I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, say you're helping
someone learn English.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would definitely add that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, first of all, you're teaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second of all, that shows that you're
engaged in the community and care about
[SPEAKER_04]: others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's something important to
add.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, if you have some sort
of qualification from the past and then
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't necessarily follow up on that,
is that actually a negative thing to put
[SPEAKER_04]: in because it shows that you weren't
committed to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that will depend on the situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say I would still include it
because you have that qualification and
[SPEAKER_04]: that training.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it can come in handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think especially if you at some point in
your application can explain why you
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't pursue that and that it's not
because you hate teaching people or
[SPEAKER_04]: something, then I would make it clear why
you veered away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it will depend on the context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is all complementary with
the rest of the package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't think that this is like unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professors, you are applying to a lab or
to a department and there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: professor who says, oh, this system looks
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person is going to read your CV
and your SOP in detail because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: commitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes in both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to read everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to be redundant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can say, yeah, I have this
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in your SOP, you can say,
yeah, I have this, but my call was go and
[SPEAKER_02]: look first or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's complementary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CV highlights basically your skills,
what you have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your SOP, you basically embellish
it nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, to go to the question about
something that maybe seems slightly
[SPEAKER_04]: irrelevant to what you're applying for,
I think also you can find surprising or
[SPEAKER_04]: unexpected connections with the person
you're applying to by adding things that
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't necessarily about science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, I added in my work with
courses on ranches in my application to
[SPEAKER_04]: grad school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the PI that I work with now has worked
with courses for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually something we talked about
during our interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I didn't just ignore that part of
my interest in my life because it didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have anything to do with mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think you weigh what's
important and what you have space for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a tricky section just because
terminology can vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably a lot of you have received
some kind of a scholarship or fellowship
[SPEAKER_03]: or financial aid in college or beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be careful that,
first of all, the things that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: putting on your CV in a grant fellowship
and award section, you differentiate if,
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance, a type of award it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fellowships are generally some sort of
program where your status is as a fellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually the words will be in the
program name.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it may or may not include financial
aid or a stipend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's a fellowship that's
associated with research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually when people see fellowship,
they think research fellowship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholarships can be other sorts of
financial aid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you may have received a scholarship
that's non-research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you just didn't have a title of
fellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't part of a program, but you
applied for it and got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, maybe the others can speak to
this too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would stick with either fellowships
or research grants as descriptions,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's kind of what PIs are used
to reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholarships is something that's like,
it's a term that's often used at the
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduate level, but not as much as
they grab at the graduate student level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you specifically got money for
research, you can call it a research
[SPEAKER_03]: grant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're part of a fellowship program,
you should call it a scholarship program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And generally, if you got any need-based
scholarships, that's not something that
[SPEAKER_03]: goes on your CV just because it's
need-based and it's not something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: applied for given your experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to clarify especially the
best thing that you can put in this
[SPEAKER_03]: section is that you applied for money for
your own independent research,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is probably what you're going to put
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that if you haven't
done already, it's a great thing to do
[SPEAKER_03]: your senior year or past your senior year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll definitely be talking to you
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so the general idea with this
section is to say, I applied for funding
[SPEAKER_03]: for my research, and I got some,
even if it's just a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount at this stage really doesn't
matter as much as the amount that you
[SPEAKER_03]: applied for and received it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and if you worked on an
application with someone in your lab,
[SPEAKER_03]: either the PI of the lab or a postdoc in
the lab or a PhD student, you can state
[SPEAKER_06]: that on your CV that you applied with X,
Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering about what you mean by
award.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like say you got a high-level award
through a mid-conference that you're not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily convinced, or say this
opportunity itself, was that something
[SPEAKER_06]: that you would put in the award section?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think award is more general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can definitely capture those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've gotten multiple travel awards,
it might put that in a different section.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's definitely something that can
go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would just want to state clearly that
you received the travel award to attend
[SPEAKER_03]: this conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a really good thing to include
in your CV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is about if you get two
awards and you can only choose one,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a great problem to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to say which one you chose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just say received award X.
[SPEAKER_03]: X and Y for conference blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you need to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only use this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it shows that you're very
competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a general point to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you applied for something and you
received it, or even if you received an
[SPEAKER_03]: honorable mention for something,
this is something that comes up a lot that
[SPEAKER_03]: minorities and women tend to say less
often when they've received an honorable
[SPEAKER_03]: mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows that you worked for it and that
you were almost there and you're a high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality candidate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something like that, that's sort
of like borderline.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it shows that you did the work and
that you either got it accepted or got an
[SPEAKER_03]: honorable mention, hence it included,
especially for research.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about if you're acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that's something if you're
developing materials for any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: course, even if you're not in a special
author on anything, that's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: should probably go in your teaching
section.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be like author,
manual XYZ, but it can be just a
[SPEAKER_03]: description of what you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So developed materials for manuals,
just like brief words that can capture the
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a citation for the manual,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, it can be just sort of a
description of your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice when you can sort of plug in a
word that's like author or like co-author
[SPEAKER_03]: or editor or something, because it helps
people key in on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not that simple, then just
trying to state what you did in a concise
[SPEAKER_03]: way is a great alternative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to quickly go back to the
second half of a previous question.
[SPEAKER_05]: That this weekend, you can put it on the
CV and you can apply for it and you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: all got accepted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you should definitely put it on your CV
under grants fellowship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the skill sections of your CV,
you should be very specific and concise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should experience that you have had in
previous jobs, undergraduate research or
[SPEAKER_00]: field or lab courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be great if you can be specific
about the type of position that you apply
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're applying for a
molecular lab that require molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, you should add that you know
how to do a PCR and you know how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: Westerblad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also looking at if you know any
type of programming language like C,
[SPEAKER_00]: C++ or Java.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are proficient in another language
like Mandarin, Spanish or French,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great skill to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are very proficient in working with
a computer software like R or Peril,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great skill to add to the skill
section of your CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so great to add in this skill section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal attributes like responsible,
teamwork, like I guess all everyone he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have like me and Microsoft or Macintosh
software proficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you would like to
take out of your CV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll probably discuss this a lot as
we're going through your CVs with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are just a few things about
formatting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, we're going to post all
these PowerPoints online.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't feel the need to, you know,
type furiously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, you know, just really
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first bullet is just about contact
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to have like your name pretty
clear on the first page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing super fancy, but clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your basic contact email and phone
number and mailing address.
[SPEAKER_03]: European CVs tend to like add a lot of
personal information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, even like if you're
married or like a photo, for American CVs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically how to contact me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want your full name on the rest of
the pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you want to make sure all of your
dates are aligned to the right or to the
[SPEAKER_03]: left, not just kind of somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they're easy to see and so people
can track your experience over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to just generally keep your
formatting really clean and simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to try to cram things
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always better to be concise and
selective than to make it denser.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your PIs will be reading a ton of
CVs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want to be able to find things
really easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to keep your font somewhere
between 11 and 13 points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fun fact, I printed all your CVs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that like there were some that
were like really big or like really small.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one good trick is like hand it to
someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them to like hold it right here and
then see if they squint or see if they
[SPEAKER_03]: move the paper away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want it at a comfortable reading
distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to use caps and bold to
emphasize headers or subsections.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been guilty of overuse of italics in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it tends to make things less readable,
not more readable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this all relates to just make sure you
print it before you send it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that'll really help you catch
things that are outside of the printable
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people want things within one inch
margins on all sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll just help you catch typos and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have access to a printer,
definitely do at least one final print
[SPEAKER_03]: before you're emailing it out to a PI that
you're really interested in or submitting
[SPEAKER_03]: it to a grad school application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one quick fix for a lot of Microsoft
Word issues is to save it as a PDF,
[SPEAKER_03]: then print it and then any formatting
problems might come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick summary of what we've been
talking to you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want you to align your experiences and
skills, the lab that you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we've sort of mentioned, there's a
couple different stages at which you might
[SPEAKER_03]: submit your CV, either in an email to a PI
where you're describing what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in and asking if they're
accepting applicants of graduate school or
[SPEAKER_03]: if their department is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can vary a lot by institution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's the stage at which you submit
it online through the department in a more
[SPEAKER_03]: formal process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to make sure that you're
tailoring your CV the length of it and
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're saying in it to who you're
sending it to and when.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to identify your strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bury them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really emphasize them on your CV and
make sure they stick out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And focus on clarity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, the best thing that you
can do is do more research, look for more
[SPEAKER_03]: research opportunities, apply for grants
for doing research and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about this, about the two pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more concise is the better and more
clear for people, but I will not kill
[SPEAKER_02]: myself is like 2.5 pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I applied to schools, my CV had like
four pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I've been like in a long
journey before PhD, so I will not kill
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I will probably remove some of
the stuff I put there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But application at this moment when I look
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't kill yourself is like,
oh, I have like a little longer or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like one page.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's less than two pages, also don't
worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially like it depends on what
point you're at and where you are in your
[SPEAKER_03]: academic career.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are just a few resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll email this out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but these are generally like places
where you can find out more about science
[SPEAKER_03]: careers and about how to sell yourself as
a scientist and just little things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
