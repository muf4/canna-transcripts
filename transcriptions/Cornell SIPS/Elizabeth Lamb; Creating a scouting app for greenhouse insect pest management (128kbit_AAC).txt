[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always like to have some other title
rather than just the sort of more,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, general explaining what it is
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating an app for greenhouse insect pest
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I should have called it actually
Bugs in the System.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has been very interesting working
on that because we find many bugs on my
[SPEAKER_02]: part and then bugs on the part of the
computer side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm also glad to see that Missy's
here because she's one of my secret
[SPEAKER_02]: weapons in terms of making sure that
things work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started looking at IPM as one
of the big things about integrated pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management is that we're always looking
for new tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we find that makes life easier
for growers, makes life easier for us,
[SPEAKER_02]: helps people in general manage their
insect and disease and weed and rodent and
[SPEAKER_02]: other pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started talking about,
talking to greenhouse growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first came, biocontrol was just
getting started and especially with the
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State greenhouse growers,
the ornamental growers, a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: small and they had not really gotten into
it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just on the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, aha, we said we can use,
let's look at biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem for a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to juggle the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to juggle the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to juggle the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's add another biological
organism in there to make it easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: you to control these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complicated in terms of what
information do you need and what factors
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have to fit into your production
scheme to make biological control work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I just had coffee, which was probably
a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm talking faster than human beings
can hear, please wave your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try and talk slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the growers said, when we said that,
they said, aha, we need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much information to try and
assimilate all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need something to help put all this
information in one place so we can look it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, we said, university people,
we need paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's create it with a handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's got the pests in there,
the beneficials, identification,
[SPEAKER_02]: biology, monitoring, application,
environment, effective pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got to be a pretty big document.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just a couple of sheets,
and you could carry it around with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we know, greenhouse growers,
they're not likely to carry their manuals
[SPEAKER_02]: into the greenhouse with them at all
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got too many other things to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sort of led us to the idea of,
OK, more and more people are carrying
[SPEAKER_02]: their smartphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got them in their pocket at all
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's there with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not take that information that was
in the biocontrol manual and put it into
[SPEAKER_02]: an app?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I will tell you, I'm not going to
tell you exactly how to create an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a programmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did have me doing a little bit of
HTML language at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I get to see the screens of the
guys that are putting this all together,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is complete Galbally book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not doing that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that step one is,
find someone who knows how to make an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And step two is, learn how to speak each
other's language at least a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't find somebody that
understands what you're talking about and
[SPEAKER_02]: you understand what they're talking about,
I'm not sure you can go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we worked with Gorges downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we found them because Jenny
Cow-Niffin had talked to them about doing
[SPEAKER_02]: an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were asking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: She talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, OK, here's how much it's
going to cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, OK, put in a grant for it,
and got the grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think that we both learned how
to make an app together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through several different people
that worked with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a lot longer than we thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we finally now are at a point where
the systems that they're using work for
[SPEAKER_02]: what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really was a discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was a joint conversation on what
can an app do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're used to apps where you go in and
you push buttons, and you get information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually the ones who suggested,
well, why not make it interactive so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can enter information that can be then
compiled and recorded through the app,
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than having it just be a site just
for information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it sounds very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you have questions while I'm
talking, I deal with chaos pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to borrow the big orange
gloves if you want to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have those just for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we start talking about biological
control, one of the most common questions
[SPEAKER_02]: that growers had, what pest are we dealing
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we couldn't back it past pest
identification.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to include pest identification in
the app, because that was where many of
[SPEAKER_02]: them were starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you know which pest it is,
then what biocontrols can you use to
[SPEAKER_02]: control it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the basis for the information
side of the app that we wanted to put
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on our part is, what do we wish
growers would do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We wish they'd keep records.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of them have records of some
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're required to keep records of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're used to doing that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we really would have liked is if we
could have this app then put all the
[SPEAKER_02]: information on their pesticides together
so that it would be able to be printed out
[SPEAKER_02]: and go to DEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State IPM does have procedures
that's called track software that does
[SPEAKER_02]: that for other crops, like apples and
turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have it for greenhouses or
Christmas trees or any ornamentals that I
[SPEAKER_02]: work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, unfortunately, doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least as a way to keep some of the
information and maybe even print it out so
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could store it somewhere and be
able to go back and look and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: what pest did we see?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did we see them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to then plan better for the
next time around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say, working with growers on
biological control, I would say it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: about three years before they have the
system in place and functioning pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well so that it's not a constant,
oh my gosh, what do we do now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what's happening with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about that long to get the
population down low enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also takes about that long to have the
biocontrol fit into your production scheme
[SPEAKER_02]: so that it is just routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so keeping records actually helps get
to that point faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does this app do then?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the list of what it
does, it covers most of those things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we had in the biocontrol workbook or
handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fest ID and biology, beneficial ID and
biology, application methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you put those beneficials on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm going to ask you guys questions
because that keeps everybody awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need pesticide interactions in a
biocontrol app?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, Neil knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been around me a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the pesticides can also be harmful
to the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's information out there on which
pesticides are better and worse for the
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficials that you're going to put down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've just spent a lot of money
putting beneficials out, which it does
[SPEAKER_02]: cost a fair amount, and then you spray
something that kills them and wall off,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably not worth your while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So knowing something about which ones you
can mix also with growers, and it took a
[SPEAKER_02]: while to, I think, convince people of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biological control does not preclude the
use of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it as an integrated system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you're using biological control
through the whole first section of the
[SPEAKER_02]: production, and then before you're going
to sell those plants, you get an
[SPEAKER_02]: application of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or perhaps you're doing most of your pest
control with biologicals, and then you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a hot spot of something else that
comes in, and you can apply a pesticide to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is not an either or system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be either or, but it is often a
both system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to have that system work
well, you need to have information on the
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and how they interact with the
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a point, Neil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then interactive scouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the concept of actually being
able to put information into the app and
[SPEAKER_02]: have it stored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the record keeping for both the
scouting and then beneficial and pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a way to graph this information
so you can see what's happening over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it available on Android and Apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is still only $9.99.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you search for Greenhouse Scout,
you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did we charge for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple actually charges us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get part of that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we wanted it to be not very
expensive so that people could get it just
[SPEAKER_02]: to try it out even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to have money.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go back into the system to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the big issues when we
started out, is that you can create one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it has to be maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question then is, how is it
maintained?
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's going to maintain it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maintenance always costs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one reason for charging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the food is here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the people who developed it,
maintaining it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that was unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to work with Cornell to allow
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to go through the intellectual
property office because of the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when money comes into the system,
it gets divided out into departments,
[SPEAKER_02]: PIs, and the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that if the Cornell's going to
maintain it, I'm OK with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Cornell's not going to maintain it,
then we have to figure out a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Gorge has actually worked with Cornell
to have all the money come back to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's our maintenance fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also then why we have to market
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to get people to know
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to do that in a digital
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to be doing that every 15
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing it that often.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to keep talking about it and
get it out to other populations so that
[SPEAKER_02]: people will buy it and we can keep it
maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does take a lot of maintenance on
everybody's part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way this is set up, it's a little
bit unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a web-based component and then a
smart device-based component to this app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the web-based component in part is
administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the part that I get to use to
add information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also where the information is stored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the user side of it,
we have somewhere where they have to
[SPEAKER_02]: create locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you what locations means as
we go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the smart device side of it,
that's where there's information retrieval
[SPEAKER_02]: by a user.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can also collect information
through the scouting on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of actually using the real
app, because scrolling I think might make
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone dizzy and sick to their stomachs,
I've actually got screenshots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought my iPad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone wants to play with it at the
end, you can come up and play with it on
[SPEAKER_02]: my iPad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this, I want information side of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there's also regulations by
Apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we learned that you cannot require an
account be made without giving them some
[SPEAKER_02]: information that is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not free, because they had to pay for
the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to give them information that
does not require collecting any
[SPEAKER_02]: demographic information or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we ask for is zip code.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the smart device, there's a whole lot
of it that you can do without creating an
[SPEAKER_02]: account and that sort of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pest beneficials, application
technology, and pesticide interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get it, depending on whether
you're on an iPhone or an iPad,
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger or smaller, just a set of buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope they're fairly clear as to
what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting when we've got
application, application technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're calling this an app,
which is an application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, sometimes the computer
terminology and the scientific terminology
[SPEAKER_02]: or the user's technology overlaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get to all of these things
several ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to have it be that way so
that wherever you are, you can find a way
[SPEAKER_02]: to get to the information you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show some of that as we go along,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the easy ways is you start with
the buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing you on the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that's called a hamburger?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you click on that, you'll also
get a written menu that'll show up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the buttons aren't working for you,
you can also get the menu there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that also is where you can log in and
out and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to use Scout or application,
you have to be logged in for the other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from page to page, we have it set
up so you can go page to page also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was set up for greenhouse
ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty adaptable to greenhouse
vegetable crops also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see hops at the end and also to
some extent to greenhouse production of
[SPEAKER_02]: hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where the pests came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for each one of these groups,
you can click on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you click on aphids,
you'll get green peach aphid and potato
[SPEAKER_02]: aphid and foxglove aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a list, and then you can go into
those pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, one of the things that's nice
is that if you get a request to add a
[SPEAKER_02]: pest, you can actually add them pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that to me is an innovation in
that I don't have to go back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: company every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For them to add information, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the Western Flower Thrips page,
the beginning of the page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these buttons are all live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you come in, I think I've got
Western Flower Thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you come into that page, and I'm like,
oh, which beneficial will work?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can click any of these and go to the
Beneficials page directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're always trying to think about how
people think about information and where
[SPEAKER_02]: they go from where.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the pest page, this is an example
of a pest page, there's the beneficials,
[SPEAKER_02]: damage caused, biology, monitoring
methods, photographs, lifecycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: and environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it starts like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long, oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit the mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can scroll down from those
beneficials to biology and identification.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got pictures in there so that people
can look at them, but also as much
[SPEAKER_02]: information as we can find in terms of
what kind of damage would you expect to
[SPEAKER_02]: see from that pest, what information from
the biological side would be useful in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of if you're trying to manage it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you monitor it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is there some information on the
environment that affects the development
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pest also?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for each one of those, we can
scroll down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is now on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that other information was on the
Smart to Fight site.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I would add a new pest and the
information that would go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would put in the scientific name,
the common name.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pest type.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a list of different pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: That list of pests I showed you,
aphids, spider mites, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually add more.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, we get some other new
kind of pest that's a whole different pest
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually just add a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is the list of beneficials
that we have in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can add new ones of those if I need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're putting up a new pest,
you just say, OK, here's the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: used to control that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for each of those segments on the
smart device, there's just a box to put
[SPEAKER_02]: content in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Betsy, are you as administrator the only
individual who can modify the site?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Eschenauer is an administrator,
and then some of the gorgeous people are
[SPEAKER_02]: also administrators.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's not very many of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had an account with it,
you would see all of this information up
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd see your own name, but you wouldn't
see admin, because that's only if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: an administrator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably helps to have not too many
people in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gorgeous guys probably are not going
in there much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the idea, then, of a beneficials
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's the same sort of thing
where you say, OK, I've got Cocumerus to
[SPEAKER_02]: control Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else will it control?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can flip back and forth
between beneficials and pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the same idea that there's a
biology and identification information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have it standardized as to what
kind of information goes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are pictures, lifecycle and
environment, and then application methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here an example of things
that we learn as we go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where all the periods went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to go back in and make sure all
the periods are actually in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They disappeared when I wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are none in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're randomly there or not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's one, too, where it says you can
see the application technology page for
[SPEAKER_02]: more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another place where we have a bit of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the specifics just for this
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the application technology page,
we have more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would look like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you click this application technology
button, you would get places to find
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could scroll down through the
different beneficials to see if there's
[SPEAKER_02]: more than one way of applying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes you don't know that when
you first find out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to just sprinkle it
over the foliage, that's one method of
[SPEAKER_02]: applying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But applying it in a sachet works better
for certain situations in ornamentals,
[SPEAKER_02]: longer term management, easier to put on
if you've got plants that are in hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: baskets, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to know if there's multiple
methods of applying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see for ephelinus, there's only
one, but for andersoni, which is a mite,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more than one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ways to check for viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really important from our
point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy something and it's dead,
it's not going to work, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you know if it's alive or dead?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes you can see them,
but sometimes you're putting pupae out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know if they're alive or dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a way you can take those pupae
that you purchased, put them in a jar with
[SPEAKER_02]: a yellow sticky trap, and watch the wasps?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can count the number of wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that will be true for
wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a mite, we want you to mix it in
the carrier, sprinkle it out, or cut open
[SPEAKER_02]: a sachet, and see if you can see the mites
running around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to know something about them
sometimes to know which mites you're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing, because there are food mites in
there for the predator mites as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So information on how you might know
whether what you purchased is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a button for pesticide
interactions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you click on that, you get this
kind of a table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this information all comes from side
effects lists that are put out by the
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that sell beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pesticides are based on the
Cornell guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're sort of New York oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are the ones for the greenhouse
and ornamental.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not all the vegetable crops
ones also.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could add that if we had a lot of
people saying we want to use this for
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could add that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so the information is usually based on
the stage of the beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see there's lots of blanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's four is very, very toxic to
the beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes down to one, which is least toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've got something that's
very toxic, but it only persists two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, that means you can come back in
with beneficials in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's greater than eight weeks,
you're out of business for ornamental
[SPEAKER_02]: bedding plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too long a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you put that pesticide on,
you're not going to be putting any more of
[SPEAKER_02]: those beneficials on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that information is really useful in
terms of managing the interactions between
[SPEAKER_02]: the pesticides and the beneficials that
you might be using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the scouting side of things,
that's where you have to use both the web
[SPEAKER_02]: and the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can add information either way,
which is sometimes useful if you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of scouts and they're all scouting
on clipboards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they might take their sheets to a
central place to have the information put
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually have multiple scouts
scouting on the same account.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have each paid to have the
app on their smart device, but they can
[SPEAKER_02]: work on the same account so that all that
information would go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a greenhouse grower in
range one and a different grower in range
[SPEAKER_02]: two, they can scout on the same app so all
the information goes into the head grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's easier to see charts on the
website, but you can also see them on the
[SPEAKER_02]: smart device.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got a small screen,
it's harder to see details.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to create a location to
where you're going to scout, you'd come in
[SPEAKER_02]: on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the page that you would see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we set it up so that there are two
levels of location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And location could be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a physical location,
but it could also be a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be petunias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in some greenhouses, the petunias
move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the pests are going to move around
with the petunias, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay in the location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the crop is actually more important
than the physical location.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can put in as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could say this is range one,
greenhouse five, bench three, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: have four cards in addition to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is you can put in anything
there that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be anything set.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll create the greenhouse one,
two, three, four, if you just let it do
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it wants, and card numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cards don't actually have to be cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think about cards because we're
counting things on yellow sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're talking about aphids,
you're not likely to see them on yellow
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky cards unless you're really not
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you have alate ones that are
flying around and getting stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be that you're looking at a
plant to count aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also do it in terms of when you're
looking at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have an actual number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can have something that's like,
OK, if I put down zero, it means there
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't any.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put down one, there are a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put down 10, there's kind of a medium
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put down 100, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll still graph out to show you
what's going on with the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't have to have an exact count.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not specific, but it has to have
exact counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're setting up your locations,
you're also going to choose which pests
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, down below here,
if you scroll down, you can also choose
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I have beneficials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I scouting for beneficials?
[SPEAKER_02]: See if they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think you've released wasps,
you might catch your wasps on your yellow
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you know that they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is we find sometimes
people are like, well, let's be efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to put our banker plants
with these wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're producing the wasps right next to
the yellow sticky card.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to catch a lot of wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should actually separate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're catching too many wasps on your
sticky cards, you might need to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about where you're putting your sticky
cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of useful information,
I guess, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you create a location,
the system actually creates a QR code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can print it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is we wanted to be able to so
you can print it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can maybe shrink it down, print it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also made sure that it actually says
where it is, because a bunch of pieces of
[SPEAKER_02]: paper with QR codes that don't tell you
where they are is not very useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned that in the middle of doing all
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you can come into an area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just shoot the QR code with your
smart device.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it knows where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will load all that information that
you put there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it work, Missy?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Missy is my secret weapon, because
she's actually using this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she finds bugs, she tells me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what works and what
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, again, we're trying to make
it easy when you're going scouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're on your smart device,
this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll automatically, you can either
select the location by hand, or you can
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot the QR code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it gives you the current date.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to change the date,
you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you might want to go back and add
information to something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's got the locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever you chose that you were
going to scout is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is also important, because
sometimes you said, OK, usually it's
[SPEAKER_02]: peppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have aphids, and we have whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're there, and suddenly you've
got thrips on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be able to add that so you
can still count them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the same thing is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're creating an application
report, it would look much like the
[SPEAKER_02]: picture that I just showed you for the
scouting report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing in that it'll pull the date up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell it where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because with applications of
beneficial pesticides, you might apply
[SPEAKER_02]: them over a larger area so that you don't
have to go in for each one and do the
[SPEAKER_02]: scouting report or the application report.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell it, OK, we're in greenhouse
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to put it over the whole
area that's covered by all of those cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can add them all in once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also knows what you're targeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you can add a different one if
you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can put on either a beneficial or
a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do multiple applications on the
same day, but you have to do them on
[SPEAKER_02]: different application reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you put in a beneficial and
then put in a pesticide, it'll say you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to put in rates and
units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a lot of places for notes in
case there's something that you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember when you went in there and you're
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that's nice is when
you're on the web, anyway, it shows you
[SPEAKER_02]: all the previous applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see what you've done already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't show those on the smart device.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, again, is the web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got a location created,
you can do lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back and find the QR code
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add a new scouting report or a new
application report.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can change data if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reports is the part that is,
I think, useful in terms of saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we did all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a typical graph of fake data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each color is a different insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the numbers doing over time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these vertical bars are
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, oh, well, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had fungus nets increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put nematodes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hooray, they dropped down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we wanted people to be
able to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at that quickly and say that
something is happening or not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all this would all scroll down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every application or every scouting report
and application report is listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can scroll down through them and
see what the actual information is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are also filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't show on this picture,
but there are filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can say, OK, I don't want to look at
all these pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to look at one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't want to look at all these
dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to look at this range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I just want to look at something in
particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you can print these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can print the graphs and all this data
from this page as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've covered some of these pros and
cons as I've gone along.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to add information or change
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a direct Contact Us button that
goes both to me and to Gorgias.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I get a question, I know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I can answer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sometimes I can go to Gorgias and
saying, OK, they're having these problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple people can scout into the same
account.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cons are I used to say it was like
having a baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I say it's like having a hormonal
teenager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because invariably, you change one thing,
and something else happens over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to keep looking at it to make
sure what happened when you did whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it does take maintenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm as good as I should be on maintaining
maintenance on my side, where I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that all the information stays
up to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on their side, when things go
wrong, they have to go back in and figure
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does require marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've sold about 300 of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty good, I think,
as a start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next thing is, OK,
what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to load the updates on
Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have two more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two that I'm involved with and a third
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once Gorgias came up with this system,
it's like, well, we might as well use the
[SPEAKER_02]: same framework for additional systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got Conifer Scout in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a picture of the Conifer Scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it's got some of the same
icons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's got some additional things
in there in terms of diseases are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Conifer Scout and weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hop scout for both field and
Greenhouse that we're working on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone else took the format from
IBM and did sweet corn scouting app using
[SPEAKER_02]: the same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you've got that system,
it makes it easier to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: The most polite question, how much did
this cost?
[SPEAKER_02]: It cost $15,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured somebody would ask that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we went in originally with
Gorgias, it cost $15,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will lay you odds that they spent more
than that in terms of people's time on
[SPEAKER_02]: getting it set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now when we go in and do another one,
we still pay $15,000 for the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the idea is, OK, at some
point, we'll come out even.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, and as I say, I think we all
learned how to do this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not if you went now and said,
we want to start from scratch and create
[SPEAKER_02]: an app, whether they'd say, oh,
yeah, it's going to cost you much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the system they have now seems to be
easier to work with and faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either it's the system or the person doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, but I think it's the system
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though we're using the same
framework for the next one, there's still
[SPEAKER_02]: some additional work that has to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's certainly not free to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to actually translate Greenhouse
Scout into Spanish and French.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a request for collective in French.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to ask them, if we want to
translate it, is that going to cost the
[SPEAKER_02]: same amount or would that be cheaper to
do?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have very good information on the
amount of pesticide use and reduction of
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is the information that we would
love to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of difficult to collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have information that shows that
there's an increasing number of growers
[SPEAKER_02]: using biological control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the assumption is, if that's true,
then there should be a reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd like to have more efficient
pesticide use, which would also then
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is the information we always want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not as good at figuring out how
to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, we need actually growers who
will give us all their data on their
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide applications as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really should be, I think we need
to look at it over a three year span to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to say, we've actually reduced this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest problem is having a
maintenance fund to keep the whole thing
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we tried to keep,
we were trying to keep it down at five.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we found out that Apple took
this much already, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figured that $10 is low enough that
it hopefully is not keeping anybody out
[SPEAKER_02]: from using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be nice to have it free.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we didn't ever figure out a
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, the way it's set up now,
there are sort of two levels that it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the price, but it's whether or
not you created an account.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could do that pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you collecting any of the data on the
back end?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you get an idea of, say,
that pesticide usage or other things that
[SPEAKER_03]: may be anonymized a little bit or regional
check for outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the ability to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had too many people using it
for scouting, or not as many people using
[SPEAKER_02]: it for scouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of those things where I need
about a week to go in there and sit there
[SPEAKER_02]: and look through it and see if we can see
who's using it for scouting even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, what kind of information
are they seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we collect information from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That side to be able to use and to be able
to say, yeah, this is, here's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we could actually prove a
reduction in pesticides unless we had
[SPEAKER_02]: scouting data from somebody for over a
multiple years on an individual account.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the potential is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janine, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting zip code information,
and I'm curious if the app includes any
[SPEAKER_00]: outlets for people in the same region
maybe to connect, whether that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: through a discussion forum or,
I don't know, some other format.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there any connectivity between app
users right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should see that that might be
something that we could do because that
[SPEAKER_02]: would also give us information about what
things people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to go and see if I can figure
out a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, we would have to put it up on the
front end because I think if we have email
[SPEAKER_02]: addresses, we might have email addresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it might be something we could do
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, we'd have to put it up on
the front end that sort of says,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you'd like to be part of the discussion
group, here's how you join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there any way that you can share
this information with multiple people,
[SPEAKER_04]: like say, there's like a range of houses
and those people don't care, but you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to share those information with,
say, multiple users?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're working on the same account,
they're all putting their information into
[SPEAKER_02]: the same account, they can all see that
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's two ways you could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else could buy the app and then
just use the same kind of information to
[SPEAKER_02]: log in and they could see the information
even if they weren't adding information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing you could do is
actually print off those graphs and labels
[SPEAKER_02]: and then share it in a hard copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions here?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you all advertising it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is another excellent question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we did, in 2015, we made the 15
top greenhouse apps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was information that we didn't have
to go out and promote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try and send it out periodically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you do something new,
you get a chance to advertise it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's another reason for actually
translating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've done a lot of the
presentations that we do out to growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got invited to Calgary, Alberta to talk
to the Alberta growers and present the
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Ishenau was the other guy,
my team did it down, did present it for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and soil program that they had
in January last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things you have to
keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we kind of get done with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, it's old news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we go out and talk about it again?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a whole other, it's another
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so anytime we can find somebody
that wants to send out the information,
[SPEAKER_02]: we make that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have your users identified pests that you
hadn't necessarily thought of before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one that I added in there that I was
requested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a THRPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, they said, we need this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can either send me information or
if I can find the information,
[SPEAKER_02]: to fill in all those blanks, I'll put it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, as I say, the fact that I
can do that without having to go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the company, which would cost money,
is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes life pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just want to get new information on
beneficials as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you keep track of how many gallons
so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you see a trend that growers or
even people working at IBM are starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: use these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can always see whenever I've just
talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you track that, you would
see, oh, yes, we did a presentation for
[SPEAKER_02]: the AERDC, the organization that was here
for their meeting last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yep, there's a bump there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually go in and see all the
names, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's one of the things that
goes back to the question about
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we advertise it, we get a bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, it's not out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of things that are digital,
we're not hitting anybody's top list of
[SPEAKER_02]: the apps of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not competition with gay mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, if you Google greenhouse,
we might be in the top greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I said, there's about 300 people on
the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that comes in funny little chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes people will tell each
other, which is useful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for something like this, the people who
apply should also have an annual fee to
[SPEAKER_07]: pay for the meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just a one-time thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because essentially, maintenance fees are
coming from the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are apps that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are probably some apps that do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think there's going to be any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody know of an app that has a
maintenance fee that you have to go in and
[SPEAKER_02]: pay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of any.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether or not it's possible,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to get maintenance from
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a one-time purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like a subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are apps that you have to renew
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I have a family calendar app that
you can pay $30.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's $30 every year to have that app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the question is, would people pay
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of depends on how much use
they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they think it's useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other problem then, too,
is like, oh, you don't pay it one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all your data, unless you have
downloaded it all, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't actually discuss the concept
of having a recurring payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see what the next two,
maybe that's something that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we put it up at a higher price.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to decide, too, what's cheap
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I think $10 is like, OK,
that's kind of a breakpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe $25 isn't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a breakpoint for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not considered too expensive to at least
try now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any other questions for Betsy?
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, let's thank Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
