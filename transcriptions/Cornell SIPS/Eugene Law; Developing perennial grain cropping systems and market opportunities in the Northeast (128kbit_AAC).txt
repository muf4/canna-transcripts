[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that great introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I will be presenting on my thesis
research, developing perennial grain
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems and market opportunities
in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start with a few
acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would first and foremost like to
acknowledge the land on which this
[SPEAKER_00]: research was conducted and Cornell
University operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For thousands of years has been the
traditional land of the Cayuga Nation,
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today this place is still home to the
Cayuga and other indigenous peoples from
[SPEAKER_00]: across Turtle Island, and I'm grateful for
the opportunity to work on this land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to acknowledge some of the
people that have been quite important in
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have been able to do this all
on my own, so recognizing Chris Pelzer,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra Wayman, Scott Morris, the techs for
the sustainable cropping systems and weed
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology and management labs and all their
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy Bartel, who's a post-doc in the
sustainable cropping systems lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been collaborating with me on many of
these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of our undergraduate assistants
and interns, only a couple of them from
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, but there have been many,
many that have contributed to this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll also acknowledge them by name at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to let you know what we're going
to be talking about today, we'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: with discussing perennial grains and why
we're interested in them, why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: studying them, why they're important for
sustainable cropping systems development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll then talk about thinking in a
systems approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you consider not just the growth
of grain or forage, not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with weeds and diseases in
the ecosystem, not just economics,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just sustainability, but all of those
things together, how they interact to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a system that can have either
beneficial or detrimental properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll then discuss my research objectives
for my thesis, talk about a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary results we've seen over the
last few seasons, and then discuss briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: some future work or continuation of work
on these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why grow perennials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody here is probably
familiar with the imposing food security
[SPEAKER_00]: issues of a growing population,
changing climate, changes in diets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and degradation of much of our natural
capital around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all sort of coming to a head at the
same time and causing a lot of concern
[SPEAKER_00]: about how we're going to intensify crop
production to feed nine or 10 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: people without further degrading our
natural capital and preventing that from
[SPEAKER_00]: being sustainable into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a diagram from Jonathan
Foley and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published in Science that looks at
the difference between a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem, intensive monoculture of
cropland, and then cropland with restored
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bubble charts show sort of the
magnitude of some of the services that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available from each of these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in a natural ecosystem,
there are a lot of ecosystem services that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available, mediating disease,
air and water quality, carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration, habitat for wildlife,
biodiversity, but it really doesn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: you that much in terms of crop production,
the food that we need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, an intensive monoculture,
particularly of annuals, gives you a large
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of crop production, but not so much
in the other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, some have now started to
think that instead of it just being a low
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of services available here,
there's actually disservices in many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas that are created by intensive
monoculture, such as soil loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: water quality impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea with restoring ecosystem services
to agriculture, which doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be perennial, but perennial plants
have been proposed to be part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, is that you can still get crop
production, maybe not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact magnitude of monoculture,
but restore many of these other services
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore create a system that is more
functioning and more sustainable over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then just to think about what it means
to be perennial, I have the definition
[SPEAKER_00]: from Webster's Dictionary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant persisting for several years,
usually with new herbaceous growth from a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see perennials throughout natural
ecosystems, not as often in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the context of agriculture,
a perennial crop is one that you plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then harvest in one year, producing some
amount of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the following year,
it'll regrow without having to replant,
[SPEAKER_00]: retill, do all of those field operations
and other managements that are needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an annual cropping system persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the benefits of perennial,
as I said, there's fewer field operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: less tillage, no seeding after that first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's soil protection and enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have crops in the ground year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's erosion control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a contribution of carbon back
into the soil by the deep rooting system,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced tillage doesn't disturb the soil
structure or biotic community as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water quality enhancement by preventing
the leaching of nutrients that often
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs in annual cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking advantage of the early and late
season growth that these crops can come up
[SPEAKER_00]: as early as it warms in the spring and be
there late into the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesizing and putting down energy
to be used in the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's potential to grow them on
areas where you might not be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: an annual crop, like on a slope land where
tillage would lead to extensive erosion or
[SPEAKER_00]: in riparian areas where those nutrient
movements off site are more of an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: for water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are major drawbacks though,
in particular lower yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, some of the perennial
grain crops we are working with are at
[SPEAKER_00]: about 25 to 60% of what a comparable
annual produces in grain for a single
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is that there's some
catching up we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of breeding these perennials,
we've been breeding annuals for thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years and very intensively for the last
century or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've only been working on perennials
for about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some inherent life history
trade-offs that have been theorized
[SPEAKER_00]: between a perennial plant that is
allocating more energy to persistence than
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the main benefits of an
annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some thought that artificial
selection can overcome that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also restrictions to your
options for management in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't rotate crops, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does limit the ways that you can
counteract disease build up in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also can't cultivate for weed
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some problematic weeds might be only
able to be dealt with through herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those herbicides are not compatible
with the crop, then you could be limited
[SPEAKER_00]: in your response to those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is quite a lot of interest in
perennial grains at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, Patagonia Provisions in
2016 released Long Root Ale, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: beer that was brewed using Kernza,
one of the perennial grains that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with here, and emphasizing in the
marketing of that product the regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of the crop production,
building soil, protecting natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was quite successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led to further interest from General
Mills, one of the larger food industry
[SPEAKER_00]: firms, and their Cascadian Farms Organic
Division, which wants to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: Kernza into some of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And General Mills is even interested in
incorporating perennial grains into their
[SPEAKER_00]: entire product line, things like Cheerios,
as part of their corporate commitment to
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have donated money towards
research, and they're very involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and development of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that amount of industry support,
there has been quite a increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of research and other activity in
the perennial grains area.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our work here at Cornell,
we're using two varieties of perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, Kernza,
is Thinopyrum Intermedium, or intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a domesticated wild relative of
annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two main ways of developing a
perennial grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either domesticate a wild
perennial plant, or you can hybridize a
[SPEAKER_00]: current annual crop plant with perennial
relatives and try to introgress those
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kernza was domesticated actually
starting around this area in the 1980s,
[SPEAKER_00]: Peggy Wagner at the Rodale Institute,
in collaboration with folks at the Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Flat Plant Materials Center, selected
intermediate wheatgrass as the most
[SPEAKER_00]: promising of several hundred wild
perennial grasses that were screened,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then did several cycles of breeding
and improvement there in work towards a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 2000s, that germplasm was
transferred to the Land Institute in
[SPEAKER_00]: Salina, Kansas, where a breeding project
has been in place for the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, working to develop what was
eventually termed Kernza, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most productive of their varieties and has
now been used in commercial food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Ace One Rye, which is a
Cichole Cereal, so your annual rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: but has been bred with a Cichole strictum,
mountain rye, and then bat cross to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some perennial genes into that rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was originally started, the program
was started in Germany, and then moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Agri-Food Canada Lethbridge Research
Center, where the Ace One variety in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular was created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have these crops,
there's a lot of interest from the food
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, there's a lot of interest in the
sustainable agricultural community about
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you have to figure out how to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to figure out whether these
ecosystem services that people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: touting are actually being realized,
and what's the magnitude of those benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to figure out how they can fit
into our current cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that's gonna be
widespread adoption, or is it really gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be in those small niche areas where you
wouldn't be able to plant an annual crop
[SPEAKER_00]: because of erosion control, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do they fit into the food
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we produce these grains, and we need to
figure out how we can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, kernza does not have the same
gluten as wheat, so baking properties are
[SPEAKER_00]: much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same Ace rye is a little bit more
similar to what you would do with an
[SPEAKER_00]: annual rye, because it is just a hybrid,
but even figuring out whether perennial as
[SPEAKER_00]: a value added proposition, similar to
organic produce, is something that can
[SPEAKER_00]: make these things more economically
viable, needs to be determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I did mention we're gonna talk about
this from a systems perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a diagram of a typical
cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some natural resources that are
inputting energy and material to the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some purchased inputs,
soil amendments, seed, fuel, labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have all the interactions
that are happening within the boundaries
[SPEAKER_00]: of the system itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interactions with soil, and then
operations like tillage and planting that
[SPEAKER_00]: create a crop that is then harvested and
produces products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also interactions with other
species in the system, non-crop plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, pathogens, invertebrate pests,
other animals that can contribute to yield
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the economic component of
assets of machinery and capital that are
[SPEAKER_00]: integral to the function of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we think about this in terms of
where perennial is gonna change this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna change the soil because of
reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna change some of these inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less planting, there's less fuel
and labor going into those operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crop itself needs to be understood in
how it's producing grain and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: forage and the magnitude of that and how
to better optimize the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found recently that harvesting and
processing of these crops is not a trivial
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can behave quite differently than
what you would expect with annuals for
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons like smaller seed size,
adhering holes on the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite as free threshing as the
annuals that have been developed for that
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in particular, the interactions
with these pests and pathogens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system where you can't use some of your
typical management tools that you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: annual system needs to be studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and finally, once we get to this stage
with crop products, where are we gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them for how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big question as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about those things,
we have developed five research objectives
[SPEAKER_00]: for one of our projects at Musgrave
Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna quantify agronomic productivity
of the two perennial grain varieties we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, understand the pest dynamics,
assess impacts on soil health and erosion
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, estimate break-even price
points for the perennial grains in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to annuals, and then evaluate
the system-wide environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability of these systems using two
different metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go through a few slides where we
highlight the different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we're looking at for each of
these objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of agronomic productivity,
it really is at the level of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and getting those crop products that
are what we're hoping to produce with the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this does involve things, not in this
study particularly, but there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things that go into agronomic
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the row spacing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the seeding rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fertilization rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the harvesting method?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the post-harvest processing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that is something that needs to
be considered before perennial grains can
[SPEAKER_00]: become a bigger part of our sustainable
cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second objective, understanding pest
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What species of weeds are gonna be most
problematic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What pathogens are gonna be infecting the
perennial grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same or is it different than
what we see on annual grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the magnitude and the impact of
these pests on grains?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the impact on grain productivity
and grain quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna look at soil health as one of the
main ecosystem services that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: realized from perennial grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna quantify effects on physical,
chemical, and biological characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanna better understand the
erosion factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much can these crops prevent erosion
and even potentially add to soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration?
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic piece of it is to figure out
what's the starting point for grain prices
[SPEAKER_00]: for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be commodity crops that
are just used similarly to other grains in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market or are they gonna be in a niche
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using enterprise budgeting techniques to
quantify all of the inputs and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of a system, we can start to
understand what the price point for a
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grain would be and then where it
might fit into a food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we're gonna evaluate system-wide
environmental sustainability by
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifying all of the inputs and outputs
of the system and then comparing them with
[SPEAKER_00]: annual crops to see what the benefits
might be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is being done using data
from a field experiment that was
[SPEAKER_00]: established at Musgrave Research Farm in
the fall of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're comparing two perennial grains,
the Kernza intermediate wheatgrass and
[SPEAKER_00]: ACE-1 perennial rye to Warthog winter
wheat and two varieties of winter malting
[SPEAKER_00]: barley in a randomized complete block
design and the split plot treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: frost seeded medium red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a sidebar about red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in intercropping and
interseeding in the sustainable cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: systems lab, increasing the biodiversity
of agriculture and natural system and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for complementarity between
different species of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so legume intercrops with grass is a
very commonly used mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's complementarity there with the
legumes fixing nitrogen to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses to grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legumes can also provide weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can moderate the soil climate,
increasing soil moisture and reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can contribute to a more diverse
soil microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose medium red clover as the
legume we were going to intercrop in our
[SPEAKER_00]: systems due to previous work that we've
done with alfalfa, white clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet clover that showed that the Kernza
in particular being a very competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: grass would outcompete some of the other
legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medium red clover is a little bit more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seeded it at a relatively high rate in
order to try to overcome that competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show some slides about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might be hard to see here,
but in one of our split plots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the side with clover in it
being just a little bit more green than
[SPEAKER_00]: the side without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing happened with Kernza
here, clover and then no clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fall 2016, it was established just
some details about a false seed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: used to reduce weed pressure applied a
target of 75 kilograms of nitrogen split
[SPEAKER_00]: between fall and spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just some seeding rate details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding rates were provided by the
perennial grain breeding programs that we
[SPEAKER_00]: received seed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the annuals were based on information
from our farmer advisory board of local
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grain farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at what it looked like in fall
2016, Kernza did not look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something we've learned that it
is a little bit slower to establish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes off in the following spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a little bit worrisome at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our wheat and barley looked fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rye was a little bit patchy,
but that also did fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward to the first harvest,
we did have a couple of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the Kernza did fill in,
but maybe not the stand density we would
[SPEAKER_00]: have liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley had some winter kill issues in that
first year, which is actually why we
[SPEAKER_00]: switched our variety of barley into the
second year, to a more winter hardy
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some significant lodging
problems with the Ace 1 rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a six, six and a half foot tall
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may have seeded at a high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other factors influencing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some plots, the lodging was as high
as 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our second harvest, you'll notice in
particular that in the rye with clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a persistence issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost almost all the rye in that second
overwintering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there was no clover, there was some
rye, but it was still not enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the major things to be
aware of in terms of certain perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their persistence is important if they're
going to be part of a productive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did figure out how to grow barley a
little bit better in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kernza did regrow quite
vigorously, although we did notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: its reproductive vigor was a little bit
lower in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's been found in
other projects with these grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: that their yields do decline over time
with the age of the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we'll go into some preliminary
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our first objective, we're looking
at agronomic productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected biomass samples in 2017 and
2018 in half meter squared quadrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We separated crop biomass from weed
biomass and then separated the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass into stems and seed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did look at components of yields from a
subsample of those seed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to mention about Kernza is that
it doesn't need to be de-hulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also harvested a strip from each of
these plots using a almako plot combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at stand density in 2017 and
2018, barley was low due to winter kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kernza is consistent across the two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye we're seeing particularly with clover
in the second year was very low density
[SPEAKER_00]: and otherwise reasonable stem counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing some effect perhaps of
clover reducing stem density in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, but we'll look at how that's
affecting yield in a couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of crop biomass, we did find that
the perennials do produce quite a large
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the phenology is different,
they are green later into the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be an avenue for a dual purpose
forage and grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did see that Kernza maintained
this biomass production across both years,
[SPEAKER_00]: while rye which was extremely productive
in the first year, again not persistent
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for a crop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then grain yields, what many people
are interested in, significantly lower
[SPEAKER_00]: yields for the perennials compared to the
annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Kernza we're seeing a decline of
about 50% in that second year and rye we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't able to harvest anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did notice, however, the benefit of
clover in the grain, in particular for the
[SPEAKER_00]: annuals in the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seems to be a nitrogen effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize these agronomic results,
we really need to address the perenniality
[SPEAKER_00]: of ACE-1 or it won't be an effective part
of a perennial cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interseeding red clover seemed to be a
benefit to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of the perennials to produce forage
might be part of making these more
[SPEAKER_00]: economically viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be doing grain and forage
quality assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yield improvements through
breeding and cropping system optimization
[SPEAKER_00]: are necessary in order for these to
compete with annuals in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity if we want to actually
achieve those food security goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of understanding pest dynamics,
we looked at weed community composition
[SPEAKER_00]: based on those same biomass samples taken
in 2017 and 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds were assorted by species,
dried and weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in collaboration with Mike
Fulcher in the Bergstrom lab, we scouted
[SPEAKER_00]: for disease and took disease samples in
2017 and 2018, cultured those in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also looked at effects on grain
quality from fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of weed biomass, we did see low
weed biomass in the wheat and rye in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year and tended to be an increase in
weed biomass from year one to year two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In rye, the weed biomass increased
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In kerns, no significant difference in
weeds from year one to year two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was quite a bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did see a suppressive effect of
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, one thing you're seeing with
these is that if you added the clover
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass back in, the total non-grain
biomass of the crops would be higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the competitive effect of the clover in
the rye is actually what we believe
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the extremely low stand
density there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have done a community ordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll spend a little time explaining
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to visualize the difference
between different communities of plants by
[SPEAKER_00]: extrapolating the statistical difference
between abundance of different plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: different samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to interpret this is that we have
our grain crops, barley being the square,
[SPEAKER_00]: kerns of the circle, ace one rye,
the triangle, and wheat as the diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are plotted for each plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have the weed species
codes showing the similarity or the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood that that weed species is
relative to that plot in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closer a weed species code is to a
certain plot, the more likely it was to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the more abundant it was within
that plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also separated this between the
first year, which is these lighter colored
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes for the plots, and the second year,
which is the black shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing a separation between
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were more species and more annual
species in the first year compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at these ellipses that
indicate the confidence interval of each
[SPEAKER_00]: crop year interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this interaction, we have the first
year of wheat, the first year of barley,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first year of rye, and the first year
of kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are overlapping quite a bit
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second year, we did see that the
annuals were starting to separate more
[SPEAKER_00]: from the perennials and what species were
present in those plots and their abundance
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to highlight which is which so you
can compare, the green is kernza,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red is rye, the yellow and brown is
wheat, and the blue is barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: For disease working with Mike,
we observed a number of pathogens in ACE1
[SPEAKER_00]: and kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, many in kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a laundry list for a single
year's worth of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even found one pathogen tar spot,
which is most common in corn, not really
[SPEAKER_00]: been seen in small grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be even a higher diversity
of pathogens to be worried about with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find that there were relatively
high vomitoxin levels in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a concern and an issue that
needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA recommendation for vomitoxin is
one part per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both cases, we were above that on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, perennial grasses and
certain rhizomes this dicots are likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate our perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were seeing that in the second year
of our weed assessment in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover can provide weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed control during the establishment
year is what we believe to be critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen with some perennials that if
they get off the ground and become
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive, close the canopy,
that weeds really aren't a problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps even with rye, one thing we're
considering is post-harvest weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed that after harvesting the rye
in the first year, that other species came
[SPEAKER_00]: right into that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any control in the fall,
it may not have been able to store enough
[SPEAKER_00]: resources to overwinter successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be looking at that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked at many pathogens and we've
seen some fungal contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there impacts on grain yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to be looked into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vomitoxin contamination is concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And developing integrated pest management
strategies for use in perennial grain
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where certain crop rotation
cultivation are not available should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: priority in order to make these effective
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of soil health, we sampled in
three years just after planting and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just after harvest in 2017 and 2018,
took aggregate soil cores from each pod
[SPEAKER_00]: and retained about a kilogram for
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculated bulk density, used LECO for
nitrogen and carbon analysis, and did
[SPEAKER_00]: permanganate oxidizable carbon soil
respiration and wet aggregate stability in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cornell Soil Health Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any data on that to present
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the literature, CURNSA has been
shown to improve indicators of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not necessarily store more soil carbon
than wheat over a period of four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, we're going to conclude our soil
sampling by doing a depth stratified
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling to maybe take a closer look at
the soil carbon dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be doing some field measurements of
rotability with rainfall simulators and
[SPEAKER_00]: universal soil loss equation modeling to
determine the difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials and annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have these two pictures, which were
taken at Musgrave in April of 2017,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing after a two inch rainfall event in
the span of about three hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: some gully erosion that occurred in an
adjacent wheat field and little to no
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of significant erosion in the
CURNSA field right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sense of scale, the surveying pins
about a foot long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was six to eight inches of soil
loss in this field in that one rain event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the intensity of these types of
extreme weather events, the frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of them increasing, this is a
major concern and a major benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the economic analysis, we're planning
on doing full enterprise budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purpose of this presentation,
we're only able to get to partial budgets
[SPEAKER_00]: so the benefits of the variables that
we're considering include field
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, land rental prices,
seed fertilizer, and then the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of grain and biomass for forage or straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be conducting a sensitivity
analysis to look closer at the yield over
[SPEAKER_00]: time using that present value to estimate
the breakeven point of these perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: crops in terms of how long they're in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look at whether price premiums for
perennial products, how that influences
[SPEAKER_00]: the economics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if the increases to yield of
perennials that's coming down the pipeline
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of breeding or even optimization
of our cropping systems can play a role
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for our preliminary results with
the partial budgets, what we did was we
[SPEAKER_00]: compared CURNSA and ACE1 to wheat in terms
of the costs and then the receipts from
[SPEAKER_00]: each system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked for a total revenue and
then used a goal seeking algorithm to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically change the prices that we were
putting in for CURNSA and ACE1 until they
[SPEAKER_00]: matched the revenue available from wheat
to get that breakeven price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see some of the costs are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, the tillage and planting
and seed costs in the years after that
[SPEAKER_00]: first establishment year for the
perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a piece of changing the
profit margins on these perennial grains
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high prices for the perennials at
this point due to those low yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: $3 a kilogram is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say for CURNSA though, when
Patagonia was sourcing the CURNSA for
[SPEAKER_00]: their initial long root L product,
they were paying over a dollar a pound for
[SPEAKER_00]: CURNSA for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't too far off of what somebody
actually paid for these products in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting it into their processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of running a few sensitivity
analyses, this was done to see what yield
[SPEAKER_00]: CURNSA and Rye would need to produce if
they were valued at the same price as
[SPEAKER_00]: organic winter wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that the yields are a
little bit lower than what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from a typical organic wheat field,
which is about 4,000 kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices do decrease if you assume
that the perennial yields stay steady over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future work will include expanding these
to full enterprise budgets to look more at
[SPEAKER_00]: the margins and then more modeling and
research into the food value chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: where these crops will be produced,
processed, and then sent to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our last objective, looking at system-wide
environmental sustainability, we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: using two different analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is EMERGY or embodied energy,
which looks at all of the inputs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: system, including natural resources such
as solar radiation, rainfall, wind energy
[SPEAKER_00]: for pollination, and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supporting the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transforms all those values into
a common unit for comparison across
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and calculates certain
sustainability indices based on the ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: of renewable resources to non-renewable
resources that are used therein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be using the farm energy
analysis tool, which is a static model
[SPEAKER_00]: that was developed to estimate greenhouse
gas emissions and fuel usage within
[SPEAKER_00]: farming systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's based on parameters such as
type of tillage, the crop area and yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: residue management and removal,
and certain inputs such as fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, seeding rate, pesticides,
and fuel consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to wrap up, I will mention a couple
of our other projects that are going on
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't necessarily going to be into
my thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at intercropping peas with
these grains and also looking at other
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic factors such as nurse crops and
row spacing in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at how to renovate an older
kerns of stand to try to stimulate new
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way that we've thought about that
is to use strip tillage for root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance and encourage increased
tillering thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has shown some promising
preliminary results using fall strip
[SPEAKER_00]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then allowing it to regrow through the
fall and into the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally looking at more closely
at the yield components of kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a multi-site project here in
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Kansas to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the development of the crop in
different climates and different regions
[SPEAKER_00]: and relate that back to more important
agronomic considerations such as harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: timing and processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to acknowledge many,
many people that have contributed to this
[SPEAKER_00]: work, in particular my committee members,
Tony DiTomaso, Matt Ryan, and Miguel Gomez
[SPEAKER_00]: in applied economics and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the lab members of the sustainable
cropping systems and weed ecology and
[SPEAKER_00]: management labs, many undergraduate
research assistants, our farmer advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: board, and many external collaborators in
particular with the kerns of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think that's the wrong photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: With respect to the difficulty of
establishing the kernza, is that because
[SPEAKER_08]: the seed viability is low or is it because
of some partial dormancy or vigor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since it's a very small seed
relative to our annuals, it just takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer to get going in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow as rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the energy resources to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at Musgrave, part of our
problem is not like we're learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these crops and things like seed
placement can be very important for a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller seeded species trying to target it
at half inch seeding depth and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a little bit, not having the
precision to place it right with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some factor of soil moisture
content and how that could affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more sensitive to
some of these variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding a way to, and it might involve
seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might involve not fertilizing in the
fall, which some people in kerns of
[SPEAKER_00]: research have shown to really just feed
the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kerns is not able to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't developed its root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't grown extensively enough to
fertilize, to uptake fertilizer in that
[SPEAKER_00]: first fall after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working through a lot of those questions
will probably contribute to enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment and then weed control in
that period as well, whether through
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation by planting in rows and then
cultivating in that first period before
[SPEAKER_00]: it's able to spread into the rows or using
chemical methods for weed control until it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets off the ground in the following
spring are some options that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned the high bomb toxic levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know some farmers managed to walk
upon toxic levels by running through a
[SPEAKER_07]: seed cleaner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wondered if those levels were before
or after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those have not been cleaned and that's
something that we've been considering is
[SPEAKER_00]: whether there are economic ways to remove
the contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is to simply blend with other
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't mention it with kerns because
of some of its baking properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is being used in flour blends for
baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might not be as much of a barrier,
but it's definitely something that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be understood and managed better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, there wouldn't be that
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of a group that has been
working on kernza pretty closely together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that involves both breeders,
agronomists, even food science folks at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Land Institute, University of
Minnesota, University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin-Madison, University of Manitoba
here, Ohio State, Iowa, Esar Leon in
[SPEAKER_00]: France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an extensive research network
around kerns right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main breeding efforts are
happening at the Land Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota and Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are, we're using what they call
cycle four, kernza, in these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Land Institute is now on cycle
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're seeing 20%, averaging 20%
yield increases across those cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been quite a lot of
advancement in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even accelerating due to the use
of genomic selection rather than more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine with a perennial where you
might need to grow it for five years in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to actually phenotype it correctly,
that that's a barrier to rapid breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with genomics, they're accelerating
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is that, yes,
we're in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting new varieties and seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just planted six new varieties out at
Caldwell Field this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be evaluating those varieties
for the northeastern climate in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, that will be a big part in
the progress of perennials and making them
[SPEAKER_00]: a viable cropping system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you mentioned that kernza was
originally started at Rodeale and then
[SPEAKER_04]: moved to the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are, of course, real different
climates and soils than what we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new varieties, has there been
selection pressure during the variety
[SPEAKER_04]: development at any of those sites like in
Minnesota or Manitoba that might be more
[SPEAKER_04]: similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what we're hoping to discover
with these new lines that we received this
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got four lines from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would expect there would be some
difference based on the selection in
[SPEAKER_00]: different climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be comparing those with some of
the Land Institute varieties at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time and seeing what comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were actually selected,
not just evaluated, but there was some
[SPEAKER_04]: selection that went on in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got lines that they're going to
have their own varieties pretty soon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're comparing the perennial crops
with, it sounds like, an organic annual
[SPEAKER_01]: crop system in each case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just say a little bit more about
that, what you're comparing it to and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you chose that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So why organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose to compare it to organic small
grains because currently, there aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical weed controls or pesticides that
are labeled in Kernza or perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought that'd be a good starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Patagonia is 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: General Mills, Cascadian Farms,
is an organic line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their broader product line is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually are very interested in
conventional production just to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be for them to get enough grain
for their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that influenced our decision there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also the sustainable cropping
systems lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of our work is into organic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having some level of prior knowledge in
that was a contributing factor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely looking into conventional
going forward is something that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to have this be as widespread as it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of rotation, we realized that
there is some artificiality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing wheat after wheat after
wheat in the same plots in our comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be an effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no rotation within this
experiment in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that there might have been
some disease buildup in the wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: barley into the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is sort of a confounding effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without having massive experiments,
it's hard to have enough variables to
[SPEAKER_00]: control for everything that you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was sort of a simplicity decision
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_07]: You answered it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was basically the role that you would
see recurrent in conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what have you heard from growers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they open to wanting to integrate that
into their systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that are
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say in terms of growers that are
looking to adopt some of these crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be a little bit too early at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still work that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, there is the demand
from the food industry to have grain to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with in their research and
development programs, or even for I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Patagonia is putting out a new kerns of
beer pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even want to expand to the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is sort of an interesting time to
live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from a research perspective,
I don't think that we've quite figured it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to recommend a farmer try
this and then have it fail in their
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's an economic incentive
because of a high demand for the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's that consideration as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any evidence that the kernza or
the ace one rye are serving as habitat for
[SPEAKER_09]: beneficial insects and were
non-pathogenic, but other types?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually don't know of anyone that's
looked at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go back to one of my slides to point
out just a pretty cool thing that we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: in one of the fields is that there's birds
nesting in our kernza in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a wild parsnip plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't want to get too close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is sort of showing that that
potential for enhanced wildlife habitat by
[SPEAKER_00]: having it in the ground year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say Ducks Unlimited has been in
talks with the Land Institute about
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial grains as a way to increase the
habitat potential of crop land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another possible benefit of
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't been looked at very closely
as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when you talk about systems,
I think about not only the impact of the
[SPEAKER_09]: particular crop you're growing,
but its impact on others.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know it's outside the scope of your
experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But within a landscape, for example,
if you had so much proportion of these
[SPEAKER_09]: perennial grains, how much could they
affect positively the other annuals that
[SPEAKER_09]: might be growing in the same area with
respect to parsnip?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of my questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know anything about the declining
yield over years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that seem to be cyclic, or does that
just assume that they zero out a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the theory is that the life history of
the plant is to reproduce more seed when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's younger, and then as it ages,
trail off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of our reason for looking at strip
tillage is it could also be intra-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition or signaling between plants
saying, OK, this space is full now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to produce as much seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on developing deeper
root systems and competitive strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it could be a little of
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just be the life cycle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that competitive effect that's
affecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can better understand that and
even manage it, that would contribute to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more persistent, sustainable system as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been thinking a lot about
herbicide resistance, which is a big
[SPEAKER_03]: problem in annual crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you expect there to be a shift if there
was widespread adoption of perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: grains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that would affect herbicide
resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my personal opinion, but I've been
thinking about it a little bit of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate chemical weed control into
perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think that there could be
some real benefits there as well because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the idea that if they get past
establishment and established well,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'll outcompete other weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the five-year projected lifespan of
a currenza field, you could spray once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice in that first fall and spring to
clean up the weeds that are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then for the next four years,
not have to spray anything, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you're reducing the amount of
product that's being applied to the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and thus reducing selective pressure for
herbicide-tolerant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be looking at the seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, it could have an effect on
the seed bank if other seeds from other
[SPEAKER_00]: weed species are fatal germinating
underneath there, fatally germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not necessarily related to your
question, but in terms of organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it has been, I think that there's
potential for certain farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to organic using perennial
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you could use your final dose of
herbicide in that establishment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the next four years, no herbicide
application, keep your records,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the end of it, there's organic
certification on the line as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's potential in those
areas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that work on herbicide
efficacy and the impact on the crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding viable herbicides would move along
a lot of perennial grain systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't really been done so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're at 1 to 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we call off questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's thank Eugene.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
