[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately, you're going to hear
legal stuff at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to keep this a little
breezy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you've heard was from your
public officials, all sorts of excitement
[SPEAKER_02]: about the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard actually really fascinating
information from the researchers and the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists about what they're doing,
really interesting stuff about the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can get to talk about regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think of them as regulations,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really it's just creating an
environment, hopefully a safe environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: given that the farm bill essentially
creates carve-outs to work in this area
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaves it to the state to develop a
program either through its own research
[SPEAKER_02]: program or through educational
institutions to establish programs which
[SPEAKER_02]: permit the research and study of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're attempting to do is listen
to the folks who are interested in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to the industry's needs,
and try to form a program that addresses
[SPEAKER_02]: the needs of industry to study and
research and create a base when things
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully change in Washington so that
this industry can really launch and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of what we're up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an iterative process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been at the agency for about
four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're on our third set of
regulations in industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a lot of regulatory work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're currently in the process of
doing now is taking what we've built on
[SPEAKER_02]: and expanding it so that our essentially
private parts and partners have rules of
[SPEAKER_02]: the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've adopted program regulations in
connection with the six sites which were
[SPEAKER_02]: available under our current law.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you've heard, we've now, well,
with current legislative session,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've essentially eliminated that 10-site
limitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a large opportunity for people
who are interested in the area to make
[SPEAKER_02]: application to the department to engage in
the study and research of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the range of, I guess the range of
research is almost as broad as the number,
[SPEAKER_02]: the huge number of applications for this
particular product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're in the ag department,
we often think about agronomic research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it goes from agronomic research to
studying cultivars, growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also involves market research and
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an entire array of possibilities,
some of which we are quite familiar with,
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of which we haven't traditionally
been involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a learning process on our part.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the fun things about listening to
all these panelists is a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're sort of going, yeah, I learned
that, but there's so much more to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the legal side, it's a really
exciting area because it both exposes your
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge base and also your profound
ignorance about what can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of like a lot of fun because
one, a lot of the things we see and that
[SPEAKER_02]: the department has done has been done over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a building effort and we're
dealing with structures that already have
[SPEAKER_02]: been created.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can form it and mold it and try to
make it work as efficiently as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is both challenging and exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's interesting and useful for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't emphasize how important it is
to get input from the folks who are there
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fields doing the research,
doing the growing and getting information
[SPEAKER_02]: because I mean, regulations are just
really rules of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to create certainty and clarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows what's going on and you can
perform in a relatively easy environment
[SPEAKER_02]: because what's required is clear and it
addresses sort of your needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So saying all of that, I'll give you a
breezy introduction to what our program
[SPEAKER_02]: currently looks like and essentially will
look like because it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notwithstanding, the challenge is we're
working in a murky federal environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got transitioning where you've
got carve outs under the federal farm
[SPEAKER_02]: bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got additional supplements in
connection with the omnibus budget bill,
[SPEAKER_02]: which expands sort of the range and scope
of these activities, but they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly fleshed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got uncertainty at the federal
regulatory level.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you speak to the agencies,
they're sort of tentative in their
[SPEAKER_02]: approach because it's new to them and the
states are the ones who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: developing these programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some ways we have lots of
opportunity, but in a certain sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're also on our own in trying to develop
programs that serve the needs of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and serves the needs of the
public and that's sort of what we're up
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially currently we've got a
research program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're accepting private partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also work with educational
institutions, but generally our approach
[SPEAKER_02]: to both of these entities is pretty much
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got an application process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The application is fairly straightforward
and the information that is required is
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly directed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously, as required by law,
require disclosure of the sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking for research proposals
because ultimately our pilot projects are
[SPEAKER_02]: pilot projects for research and study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Dan tells us you've got to be
thoughtful and you've got to plan,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's true in terms of your approach to
this agency as well because what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for is a thoughtful plan as to
what areas you would like to work in and
[SPEAKER_02]: develop which contributes to the knowledge
and the development of this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a particular industry,
but it's research and study-based and it
[SPEAKER_02]: also needs to be appropriately scaled to
the project that you're proposing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean we've had suggestions in our
regulations about agronomic research and
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing research, but essentially what
you really need to do to have a successful
[SPEAKER_02]: application is to think about what you
want to research, what areas can be
[SPEAKER_02]: developed and then make the proposal to
the agency and we're pretty flexible,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you need to develop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be thoughtful and if it is,
then chances are you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: reviewed favorably.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also need to think about security
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now security issues from our experience
has been sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first embarked upon looking at
regulations, there was a huge security
[SPEAKER_02]: concern and we were thinking that we
really needed very structured approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of security that was necessary
for folks cultivating industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_02]: as we learned more about other states'
experience and other growers' experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had a much softer approach and
currently while you need a security plan,
[SPEAKER_02]: the security plan needs to be a sensible
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to consider what kind of access
there is to the plants being grown or
[SPEAKER_02]: access to the facility and we don't have
any specific requirements, but what you
[SPEAKER_02]: really need to do is assess the risks that
you may have in connection with security
[SPEAKER_02]: issues and then adopt appropriate
responses to those risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a more flexible approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a top down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to fence your growing areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have a particular kind of
signage, but it's more of an iterative
[SPEAKER_02]: process where you think about what your
problems could be and how do you address
[SPEAKER_02]: them and that's sort of the approach we've
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also mention that the scale is
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about demonstration
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't necessarily needs to be
really, really tiny, but it needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately scaled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're researching is appropriate
to the amount you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are obviously issues in connection
with what we do and evaluating,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean basically we will be looking at
background checks and we will be looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at past experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sort of interesting in our
discussions with other state agencies,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was an area that people identified,
yeah, there's a concern here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had applicants who had all sorts of
issues, be it regulatory or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to be mindful and make sure
that the folks you partner with in
[SPEAKER_02]: research are responsible individuals and
that's sort of what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are requirements for disclosure
and you take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically, requiring our partners to
enter into partnership agreements or
[SPEAKER_02]: research partner agreements and basically
that's your roadmap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a regulatory
structure which gives you sort of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: general marks you need to hit in
connection with what's expected of you as
[SPEAKER_02]: a research partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dealt with in our research partner
agreement and basically what that does is
[SPEAKER_02]: it ties you to scope of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you undertake to conduct a
project and we expect you to adhere to
[SPEAKER_02]: that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flexible enough to modify as you're
going on so that if you want to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: related areas you can, but if it's a
separate research project then you'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a separate application, but there's
flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides for disclosures and vetting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes clear that once you get a permit
that it's not a transferable permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It permits subcontracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have reporting requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean basically if you're involved in
a project there'll be annual reporting
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements providing data, but at the
same time our research partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement protects your intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: That which you develop is yours and we
make it clear that it's yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's covered in our agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deal with testing regimens and
procedures to make sure that it is indeed
[SPEAKER_02]: when you get it it's industrial hemp and
when you grow it it's industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the useful things for us in
connection with sitting through this
[SPEAKER_02]: summit we heard issues with respect to hot
seed and that's something that we probably
[SPEAKER_02]: need to take a closer look at because this
is a new issue that I don't know if Chris
[SPEAKER_02]: had seen it, but it was a new issue for me
and it's something that we deal with in
[SPEAKER_02]: our partnership agreements, but it's
something I think we maybe want to kick
[SPEAKER_02]: the tires a little better on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deal with the security.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of the structure of our
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the structure of our program
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit more formalized now and
that's sort of where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I would encourage you
all to do because we will be formulating
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and there's a lot of public
comment and we look forward to that
[SPEAKER_02]: comment both during once we publish
regulations we get comment, but even now
[SPEAKER_02]: before they get published.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are issues we need to focus on
you are the best folks to advise of what
[SPEAKER_02]: those issues are because you're working in
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey I'm just a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can create clear regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can create clear rules, but basically
it's your knowledge base that helps me get
[SPEAKER_02]: to a position where everyone knows what's
going on and we can do a program that
[SPEAKER_02]: works for you because ultimately that's
what our job is to create a clear set of
[SPEAKER_02]: rules that you can understand and you can
follow and creates a space for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: operate that won't run into problems with
federal authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the one thing that I would
reiterate, I don't have a great deal to
[SPEAKER_01]: add to what Scott has talked about this
afternoon on the regulations, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward one of the things I'd like
to reiterate which Scott brought up is the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of in the application process
and in the regulation the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: formulating the research questions and
articulating that in a clear way to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know up until now this has been a
program where we had a limitation of 10
[SPEAKER_01]: permits and there has been the ability to
have a great deal of interaction with
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants and also the ability to have us
when we get an application and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: questions to call people and clarify and I
think as this goes forward based upon the
[SPEAKER_01]: interest that I've seen here today and the
number of phone calls I've had as we go
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and this becomes a higher volume
program for us if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very, very important that
when the research or when the applications
[SPEAKER_01]: come in to us that the research questions
are well thought out and I guess one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that I would throw out there to
people as well as you know Scott and
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and other staff at Ag and Markets
being available to help is also you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks who have sort of gone before
whether they're the Morrisville folks or
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cornell people or the Cooperative
Extension people out there who can help
[SPEAKER_01]: you to formulate a good research question
and get a strong proposal into us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it takes the same amount of
effort to look at something that's strong
[SPEAKER_01]: and well written versus something that
perhaps is not as strong so I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be really important as the volume
of the program increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right we're going to entertain one
question because we're running up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of our lease time here in this
space but one question that producers have
[SPEAKER_00]: been asking is you know I think it's a
valid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does growing hemp negate the ability to
participate in any other federal programs
[SPEAKER_00]: given the federal rules about growing
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: An interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't practice in the area so I will
give you a non-legal response which
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't bind the agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the lawyer coming out right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the federal farm bill a carve-out
was created.
[SPEAKER_02]: It authorizes these programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: My approach or my thought would be in that
you have a specific federal carve-out it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be inappropriate for a federal
agency to tell you that this is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: disqualify you from other available
federal programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my personal analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal agencies may beg to differ but
that's just where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris any last thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right a round of applause for these
two please.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a great day here I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had great panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think hopefully you've learned at least
as much as I've come to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we heard a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One we heard the need to go forward in a
collaborative manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The need for state agencies to have kind
of a uniform protocol and I'm thinking in
[SPEAKER_00]: my case of the Department of Agriculture,
Department of Health, Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice and frankly our funding partners
at Empire State Development as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we heard about the need for
continued research, applied research,
[SPEAKER_00]: about varieties, about fertility,
about utilizing the right equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right cultural methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean for rotations?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of questions that we
have which frankly kind of conjures up in
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind integrated plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that what we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little plug for Cornell there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we heard a little bit or quite a
lot about the need for federal advocacy to
[SPEAKER_00]: help lift that cloud that we're still
operating under addressed in that last
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to borrow a little bit from
something that Dan Dalgen from JD Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: said this morning I think that I think we
need the correct interaction between all
[SPEAKER_00]: the state agencies and our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need the leadership here at the
land grant system as we've evidenced today
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leadership from the industry which I
think is certainly clear to me here from
[SPEAKER_00]: this meeting today and exemplified in our
panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the leadership at the state level
which I think we've clearly demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the participation of our Lieutenant
Governor and by the Governor's actions in
[SPEAKER_00]: this new opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you combine that with a vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it needs to be a common vision
that we all share and that we stay close
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that let me just say we're
committed to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for participation, for your
energy, for your passion about all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A special thank you to our legislative
partners who have helped with the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation to make this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly a special thank you to our
host here today, Ed Cornell, for putting
[SPEAKER_00]: up with us all day long and for their
continued partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that thank you all for attending
the very first hemp summit in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
