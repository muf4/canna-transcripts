[SPEAKER_00]: at Michigan State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the topic of this week's presentation
is nutrient management and established
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings and how to correct nutrient
problems once the crop has been
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Eric, I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful 46-degree sunny day in
central Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a typical mid-January day for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll be covering here today is
approaches to correcting nutrient problems
[SPEAKER_01]: in existing plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And previous webinars have covered topics
such as the soil characteristics and
[SPEAKER_01]: testing of soils, interpretation of the
testing, and then pre-plant soil
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments, also plant tissue analysis and
interpretation of analysis, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms of nutritional problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great background.
[SPEAKER_01]: For what we'll cover today, which is what
to do if a nutrient need is known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll cover macronutrients, primarily
nitrogen is the primary concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go through some of the
micronutrients that can become problems in
[SPEAKER_01]: the berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also talk a little bit about
fertigation, because I know a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in different regions use the
fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's first consider nitrogen
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, of course, important because
nearly all of these berry crops require
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen on an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big question is what can you do to
use nitrogen efficiently?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that regard, there are questions
about the fertilizer type, the rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: the timing, and the placement of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the four items I'd like to go
through under nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, regarding the nitrogen fertilizers,
a lot of them to choose from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to point out generally those with
the highest nitrogen contents are the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest per pound of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are generally the most preferred
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, these also vary in their
reaction in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of them, certainly all of them
that supply nitrogen in ammonium form or a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of ammonium and nitrate,
tend to have an acidifying reaction in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those that supply nitrogen only as
nitrate have a basic reaction in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the measurement of that is called the
lime equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on the far right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lime equivalent is essentially the
pounds of lime that would be equivalent in
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction to one pound of nitrogen supplied
as a nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were applying a pound of
nitrogen as calcium nitrate, that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it indicates that for every pound of
nitrogen applied as that source,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would have the equivalent reaction in
the soil of 1.3 pounds of lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not a bunch of lime, but it certainly
over time can affect pH of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those with negative numbers
indicate that you would have to add lime
[SPEAKER_01]: to neutralize the acidity supplied by
those sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about ammonium sulfate as
being a great nitrogen fertilizer for
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the reasons for that is it's
so acidifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: For every pound of nitrogen you supply as
ammonium sulfate, you'd have to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: five pounds of lime just to neutralize the
acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So choosing these sources has indicated,
first, cost per pound of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, whether there is a need for
additional nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the primary issue there is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a reason to choose
ammonium, ammoniated phosphates,
[SPEAKER_01]: monoammonium or diammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you want to change soil pH in
which direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, volatilization losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for blueberries, the material 's choice
are urea if the pH is below five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's below five, you want to
maintain it in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd use the less acidifying urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might also choose MAP or DAP if the
phosphorus is also low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we typically say if the pH is a
little bit high and you'd like to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: it somewhat, then ammonium sulfate would
be the choice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And MAP and DAP would again be good
choices if you are in need of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: For brambles and strawberries,
usually the cheapest forms are best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So urea or ammonium nitrate are good
choices there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a number of growers use calcium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some reasons for that,
particularly in the middle of the summer
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's some concern about
volatilization losses from urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this volatilization aspect is something
that we primarily are concerned about with
[SPEAKER_01]: urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you apply urea prills to a soil
surface, the first thing that happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: that prill is hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as it takes up water, that small
organic molecule of urea hydrolyzes and it
[SPEAKER_01]: produces ammonium and bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an important aspect of this is that
this has an immediate effect of increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH around that prill or in the
immediate vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if ammonium is present near the soil
surface under high pH conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it can be converted to ammonia gas
and lost to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the reason this is an issue
with urea is because of this pH increase
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get immediately after applying
urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say that ammonium that's
applied as, say, ammonium sulfate can't
[SPEAKER_01]: volatilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most cases, pH of the soil is low
enough to where volatilization losses
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't a real big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what increases the potential for
volatilization losses of ammonia gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off, if the urea particle
remains on the soil surface, so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't irrigate it in or you don't receive
rain for several days, then that increases
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the temperatures are very high,
so if they're above 80 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that increases the potential for
losing more of the nitrogen in urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I mentioned, if the soil pH is
high, this also increases potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of blueberries,
where soil pH is naturally low,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is less likelihood of losing
nitrogen in the form of ammonia gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something to consider in the
case of strawberries in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we might be fertilizing in the
middle of the summer where the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures are real hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd want to make accommodations for
reducing that potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that means irrigating that
fertilizer into the soil to protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So applying the proper rate is important
as far as optimizing the efficiency of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen use by any crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you apply more than the crop needs,
you're going to have a lower use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, and you may cause other
problems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rates vary from state to state and
region to region, and certainly due to
[SPEAKER_01]: different soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I have here is just a general
range for nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that we start with one or
two year old fields at 15 to 20 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: actual per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's just ramped up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time you get to a mature
field, you might be applying between 70
[SPEAKER_01]: and 40 pounds of actual nitrogen to the
acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rates here depend primarily on the
soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sandier the soil, lower the organic
content of the soil, the higher rate you
[SPEAKER_01]: would probably need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen rates for brambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, again, starting somewhat lower rate,
20 to 40 pounds the first year,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 30 to 60 pounds the second year,
and then up to 50 to 100 pounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: third year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And older plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the higher rates would be
applied on sandier soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some indication that all
bearing raspberries would require higher
[SPEAKER_01]: rates than, say, summer bearing
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this makes a little bit of
sense if you consider those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor plants are cut down to the ground
each spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're generating a whole new stand of
canes, as well as producing a crop of
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit all in one season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers, particularly on sandier
ground, will find that rates even as high
[SPEAKER_01]: as 100 pounds may be optimizing yield for
fall bearing raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these rates vary somewhat from
region to region.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, we think about 40 to 60
pounds of nitrogen to the acre during the
[SPEAKER_01]: planting year, and then 50 to 100 pounds
per acre during the production season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these rates, again, are going to be
highest on the sandier soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit about rates, but how about
timing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think timing is a critical factor as far
as trying to optimize efficiency of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Michigan, we feel that a good
system would be to apply, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer in a split application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So half of it going on about bud swell
time before bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second half of it going on
during petal fall, perhaps three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this typically does for us is
provides nitrogen available to the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: during the early rapid growth flush from
petal fall through green fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second application later in
the season tends to maintain adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: levels through the harvest period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may find that it makes no
difference if you apply nitrogen in one
[SPEAKER_01]: application or two applications if you're
on a heavier soil or a soil high in
[SPEAKER_01]: organic content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you'll find benefits from the
split application system, particularly on
[SPEAKER_01]: the sandier sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other point I wanted to make
that you're probably aware of is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing blueberries in cold
locations where winter injury is a
[SPEAKER_01]: concern, then applying nitrogen later than
June is should be avoided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is it tends to reduce
hardiness of the bushes going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing hardy blueberries in
a less stressful winter location,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you might be able to get by with
applying nitrogen a little bit later in
[SPEAKER_01]: the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing blueberries where
you're just stressed by the winter year
[SPEAKER_01]: after year, then this is where you want to
be real careful about applying nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining high levels of available
nitrogen later in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about timing on brambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, what I would suggest is if you're
growing on heavier fertile soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably do just as well applying all your
fertilizer at about bud break time in
[SPEAKER_01]: April or May.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing on sandy ground that's
low in organic matter, then you might go
[SPEAKER_01]: to this split application approach where
you're applying half at about bud break
[SPEAKER_01]: and then half three to four weeks later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this will maintain levels of
nitrogen available to the plants later
[SPEAKER_01]: into the growing season and particularly
with fall fruiting types support fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: production way out into September and
October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timing for perennial strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, recommendations vary from the
planting year versus fruiting years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during the planting year, what we
typically recommend is 20 to 40 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen two to three weeks after
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that this is delayed
to where either irrigation or rain has
[SPEAKER_01]: settled the soil around the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a second application in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be during planting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: During a fruiting year, things change
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, we're recommending applications
of 30 to 50 pounds of nitrogen applied at
[SPEAKER_01]: renovation time after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about the same amount of nitrogen
applied in late August or early September.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some growers in Michigan I know
that feel that they need just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of nitrogen early in the spring of a
fruiting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by a little bit, I mean just 10 pounds
or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're growing on very sandy ground,
this is I think kind of a risky thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do because you can generate too much
vegetation by fertilizing in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if over time you find that that works
for you on your soil, then that might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good approach as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, nitrogen placement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issues here are really a balance
between trying to put the fertilizer where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's available to the plant versus not
concentrating the fertilizer so much that
[SPEAKER_01]: you create a salt issue and injure the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with blueberries, what would be a good
approach is with young plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: so in the first or second year,
apply in either a two to three foot wide
[SPEAKER_01]: circle around each plant by hand or in a
three to four foot wide band down the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since these bushes are usually at a 10
foot row spacing, if you're broadcasting
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer over the entire surface,
that's very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the bushes mature, you can imagine that
the root system of these old bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: probably intertwines in between the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I don't think you get much
advantage from banding any fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: within the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's certainly easier to just
broadcast fertilizer in older established
[SPEAKER_01]: plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked a little bit about salt
index in the earlier webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a measure of the potential for
causing salt stress to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I again wanted to reiterate that you
often see these salt index values for
[SPEAKER_01]: different fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you consider these only,
then you steer away from ammonium nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, that has a very high salt
index and a high potential for causing
[SPEAKER_01]: injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might look more closely at calcium
nitrate, for example, that has a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: salt index value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these values are based on units of
actual fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're working in the field,
of course, you're thinking about I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply, for example, 50 pounds of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best source of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're using ammonium nitrate
that's higher in nitrogen, you would use
[SPEAKER_01]: less of that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this last column is the salt index
per unit of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the numbers
flip-flop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ammonium nitrate might actually be more
safe to use on younger plants than calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect of this, of course,
is it's easier to hand-apply more diluted
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers such as calcium nitrate than
ammonium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen placement in brambles,
kind of the similar thinking here as with
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first year, you'd be either
applying it in a circle around each plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or, again, in a band down each row.
[SPEAKER_01]: In established plantings, you're kind of
to the situation where you might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more efficient by applying that
in a band under the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most cases, growers are trying to
maintain a sod between the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to fertilize the sod and
fertilize the raspberries, it might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: better choice to broadcast under those
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nitrogen placement in
strawberries and perennial strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, during the planting year,
generally you're probably broadcasting
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer because of the close row
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could consider banding in a
smaller planting and certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: broadcasting when the plants are mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric, there's two questions of timing that
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was from Kathy, and I think,
Kathy, you might have to jump in to
[SPEAKER_00]: clarify what you were looking at there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Eric, I was wondering when you said
nitrogen and blueberries shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: applied after June, if that was the middle
of June, the end of June.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping to clarify that just a
little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say no fertilizer after the 1st of
July.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure everything goes on before
July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking for the box of other
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there another question besides that,
Kathy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's in the chat box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in chat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Eric, it's in the chat box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our folks over at Oneida County wanted to
know what's the right timing for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: in ever-bearing strawberries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ever-bearing strawberries,
I haven't had a whole lot of experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, those are on plastic,
so you're fritigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the timing there would be more of a
spoon feeding approach through the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some real good information
from North Carolina State University for
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic culture strawberry systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'd suggest you take a look at
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, you're trying to grow a
canopy throughout the season, and then to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain fruiting for an extended period
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's the first planting year on
ever-bearing strawberries, then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting from August, September,
and October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to supply nutrition during that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then typically under our conditions,
growers are trying to overwinter those
[SPEAKER_01]: beds for fruiting the following spring as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would assume if you fertilize them
well, through the previous year,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you probably would not require too
much in the spring prior to that June
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanted to mention organic
sources of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about this a little bit in
the previous webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a number of materials to
choose from here, a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: plant product and animal product
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soy meal, seed meal, blood meal,
fish meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are relatively high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they release and make available a
relatively high percentage of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: content during the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using manures, these,
as we mentioned before, should be analyzed
[SPEAKER_01]: before you're using those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically they contain lower nitrogen
concentrations and release a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of nitrogen to the crop during
the course of the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then compost, of course, are aged and
decomposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually plant materials, they contain
lower nitrogen concentrations as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to be somewhat stable
because they're aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to release a lower
percentage of their nitrogen during the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of the first season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are generalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a good rule of thumb is these
products with higher nitrogen contents
[SPEAKER_01]: usually mineralize higher percentages of
the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the course of the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then any compost or aged manures,
for example, tend to be more stable and
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to mineralize and make available
lower percentages of the nitrogen during
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question, is it risky using fresh
manure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during production years, if you're
using fresh manure, this should go on the
[SPEAKER_01]: year prior after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with some crops, blueberries in
particular, some marketers would advise no
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh manure ever being used in plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that link, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a little bit of work with
nitrogen release from organic sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic blueberries in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to show you some of those
data just because they illustrate the
[SPEAKER_01]: release pattern for some of these organic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the same material,
but two different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this McGeary's soy-based 811 organic
fertilizer was applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 10th, and then we simply watched
the total inorganic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ammonium and the nitrate levels and
the soil profile after application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that there was a pretty
immediate release of available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tended to decline as the season
progressed, but particularly at the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: rate, there was still elevated level of
available nitrogen in the middle to end of
[SPEAKER_01]: September during this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were no differences in nitrogen
levels in the blueberry bushes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does illustrate that at least this
material tends to release nitrogen on a
[SPEAKER_01]: gradual basis that tends to mimic I think
pretty closely the nitrogen demand by the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are some other similar data from
a different blueberry field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we just use one rate of this
particular nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was applied at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that immediately there was
an increase in available nitrogen from the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levels declined, but again, even towards
the end of September, levels in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: were elevated over plots receiving no
fertilizer at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this presents a little bit of a concern
about how you fertilize organic
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries without elevating levels of
available nitrogen late in the season when
[SPEAKER_01]: we would like those plants to be slowing
down and getting ready for winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen in two of these trials
increase in the level of bud damage during
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter because I think of this
elevated levels of available nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: later in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: The use of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here most of these crops have a fairly
high demand for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fields often require regular
applications of potassium, perhaps not
[SPEAKER_01]: annually, but often on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fertilizer choices really should
be based on, of course, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing conventionally organic,
the cost per unit of K2O, whether you need
[SPEAKER_01]: other nutrients that might be in the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a potential hazard from chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cost per unit is cheapest for
potassium chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium sulfate is somewhat higher cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potassium magnesium sulfate,
or SOPO-MAG, is even higher cost per unit
[SPEAKER_01]: of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential problems with potassium
chloride or muriate is that it contains
[SPEAKER_01]: chloride, which in high enough
concentrations can damage berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are organic sources of SOPO-MAG of
potassium sulfate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different material than this in
that it's apparently less processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's usable organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, wood ash contains a
fair amount of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's being used in blueberries in
particular, it would have the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rates of potassium for existing
plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, if deficiency exists,
100 to 200 pounds of K2O per acre will
[SPEAKER_01]: correct those shortages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers over time that find that they need
maintenance applications of potassium find
[SPEAKER_01]: that 50 to 100 pounds per acre is adequate
to do that job.
[SPEAKER_01]: The timing isn't as critical as it is with
nitrogen, partly because potassium moves
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil but much more slowly than
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting it on at the right time is not
so critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: One point I'd make is that fall
applications would be preferred if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using the cheaper muriate of potash so
that that would allow more time for
[SPEAKER_01]: chloride to leach out of the root zone
before plants begin growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: following spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it certainly would be the case if you
were applying a relatively high rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, say 100 pounds of K2O or
higher, and you wanted to use muriate,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would certainly be best applied in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that excessive use of
potassium can cause magnesium shortages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Marvin covered this pretty well
previously in that there's a balance
[SPEAKER_01]: between the cations in soils, calcium,
magnesium, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you continually apply potassium
because you think that you need it every
[SPEAKER_01]: year, you can cause trouble with
inadequate availability of magnesium to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question, how late in the fall
can you apply potassium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, it is going to stay in the
root zone over quite a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could apply it any time in the late
fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That potassium should be available to the
plants the following spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the potassium fall application would
allow this time for chloride to leach out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus sources, nothing real striking
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of different materials
to choose from conventionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all are very highly soluble and
highly available to berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a need for phosphorus,
then the ammoniated phosphates would be
[SPEAKER_01]: good choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're only interested in
phosphate, then these are expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For organic producers, bone meal,
fish meal are good sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock phosphate isn't used too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mentioned it because in very acidic
soils, such as blueberry soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: the solubility is quite a bit higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be a reasonable source of
phosphate for blueberries where the acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil pH increases the solubility of the
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question about, a good question,
a common question about the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium in the fall as an antifreeze or
to increase the hardiness of bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen any data to support
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it from a number of blueberry
growers in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some growers in Michigan
that actually apply foliar applications of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium in the fall, thinking that it
helps to slow down the bushes and get them
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't say there's any scientific
evidence that that's true, something that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably is worth investigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along those lines, I think if you're
working with growers and a question comes
[SPEAKER_01]: up, or a grower indicates that I do this
and it does good for me, you might suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: to them to leave some untreated check
areas so that they can actually learn what
[SPEAKER_01]: the treatment did versus what they think
it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, sources vary from magnesium sulfate,
epsom salts, calcium sulfate or gypsum,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium magnesium sulfate, and then
calcitic or dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, at least under our soil
conditions in Michigan, if we're low in
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and or calcium, it nearly always
indicates that the pH is too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the correction would be to apply either
calcitic or dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under our conditions, we tend to have more
of an abundance of calcium relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dolomitic lime usually is a better
choice, but soil tests will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the pH is appropriate, then a source of
calcium might be gypsum, epsom salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: or SopoMag would be good sources of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, I think that's fairly uncommon
to see very low levels of magnesium or
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a soil with a proper pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and fruit quality is something
that generates a whole lot of attention
[SPEAKER_01]: and interest, and for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because elevated calcium concentrations in
fruit tissue are often associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: improved quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quality is such an important variable
in berry crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know, for example, that there's a
reduced incidence of some physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders of fruits if calcium levels can
be increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bitter pit is a localized deficiency of
calcium in apple fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a fruit quality related aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there's an increase in
firmness that usually accompanies an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in fruit calcium concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this may relate to the inhibitory
effect of calcium on some of the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes in fruit that are associated with
the softening and degradation of cell
[SPEAKER_01]: walls and the natural senescence of fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium has a direct effect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a reduction in rot
that's caused by several fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this may also go back to the
inhibitory effect of high calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations on some of those enzymes
that originate from the fungus that
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to breakdown of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all good reasons to think about calcium
applications for improving berry quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's known there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we know that an increase in calcium
levels in berries can improve the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that from the fact that if you
dip strawberries or blueberries in calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions after harvest, that increases
firmness in it and or it reduces the rot
[SPEAKER_01]: incidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, dipping these berries in
solutions doesn't have much commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: utility because it has quality issues in
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does illustrate that if you had
ways of increasing calcium concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: in the berries, you'd probably see some
benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most likely approach to increasing
calcium levels in the berries is to spray
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants with calcium sprays prior to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a number of studies in
different parts of the world on these
[SPEAKER_01]: three groups of berries, blueberries and
strawberries and brambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium sprays have sometimes
increased firmness and prolonged the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: life of berries and or reduced botrytis
rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the most consistent thing
about these studies is the inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these effects are seen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not seen other times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another one where there's no
clear answer for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd advise people, if they're interested
in working with calcium sprays,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, go back to that rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to make sure that you're leaving
untreated areas so that you can tell
[SPEAKER_01]: whether your treatment actually did some
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another approach, of course, to increasing
levels of calcium in the berries would be
[SPEAKER_01]: to supply it through the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also hasn't been particularly
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some data that we collected on a
low calcium blueberry soil years ago in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we selected the site because it was low
in calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we applied either 1,000 pounds of
lime or 500 pounds of gypsum each year for
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that this had a very
dramatic effect, particularly with the
[SPEAKER_01]: application of lime, of increasing the
calcium concentrations in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat lesser degree with the use of
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found from a quality
standpoint is that these modest rates of
[SPEAKER_01]: lime and gypsum raised the pH and calcium
levels of the soil, but had inconsistent
[SPEAKER_01]: effects on the leaf calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in two years, when we measured them,
had no effect on fruit calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they seemed to get calcium somewhat
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did not elevate calcium levels in
the fruit themselves, which is where we
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the treatments, as a result,
had no effect on fruit yield or shelf life
[SPEAKER_01]: or the firmness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought this was a good test to talk
about here because it was in a field that
[SPEAKER_01]: was low in calcium to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, we were able to pretty
dramatically increase calcium levels in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this had pretty minor effects,
if any, on calcium levels in the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and particularly in the fruit where you'd
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is an interesting micronutrient,
and it can become deficient in berry
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if there's a shortage,
it causes poor shoe growth and dieback or
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced fruit set or sometimes fruit
deformities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these blueberry pitchers were supplied
by a colleague in Italy where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: working with an Elliott site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was extremely low in leaf boron
levels, down to 8 to 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had these lesions developing on some
of the fruit, these corky lesions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those were corrected by boron
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a question, is there a
synergistic effect of calcium on nitrate
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake when applied as calcium nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good question, and I don't know
as I have a good answer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium nitrate, of course,
because you're applying only nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: can be relatively efficient if it's not
leached out of the root zone quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it may be very inefficient if you're
irrigating heavily after applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you receive two or three inch rain
after your application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will remove it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know of any specific effects
of calcium on uptake of nitrate in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting back to boron, though,
I wanted to mention that berries,
[SPEAKER_01]: like most crops, are very sensitive to
excessive boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So applications should be made only if the
soil or leaf analysis indicate a need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So applying boron because somebody told
you that it may correct deformed berries
[SPEAKER_01]: is a poor approach if you don't have some
data on boron levels in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more importantly, in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a need, it's easy to get boron
into these crops, either through foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, applied early in the season
to the foliage or through sprays to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be applied with a weed spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even soil applications of granulated
material in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron deficiencies occur periodically,
but these are nearly always related to a
[SPEAKER_01]: pH that's too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most common occurrence, of course,
is in blueberries, where if the pH is
[SPEAKER_01]: about 5.5 under our conditions,
we start to see this chlorosis due to iron
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or occasionally in bramble or strawberry
fields, if pH is very high, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is really related to effect
of pH, and dropping the pH is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: good solution to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of foliar iron chelated
products available, and those do provide
[SPEAKER_01]: some leaf greening if they're applied to
affected bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I question whether you really see an
improvement in the vigor from those
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes it's more of a cosmetic
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another micronutrient where
deficiencies can occur in berries in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I read, they're probably
even less common in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And partly because it, again, is usually
pH related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the pH is too high, this limits the
solubility of manganese, and can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies of manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that blueberries,
of course, seldom run into manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency is that the pH is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it increases availability of that
micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a need for manganese,
check pH and reduce it if it's too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are foliar sprays of manganese
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese chelates can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fungicides contain significant
amounts of manganese, and those are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good sources also for labeled crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc, similar to manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see deficiencies occasionally in
berries in the Midwest, and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs also in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shortages, again, typically occur on
soils that are sandy and too alkaline,
[SPEAKER_01]: too high in pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treatments here, again, check the pH,
reduce it if it's too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply foliar sprays of zinc
sulfate or zinc chelate products if the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some fungicides that contain
zinc that can be reasonable sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and question, does manganese have
some fungicidal properties itself similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to copper?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could answer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper and molybdenum, these soils in the
Midwest and Northeast appear to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate levels of these micronutrients to
berries because deficiencies haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: really been documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: A colleague in Georgia indicates that
rabidite blueberries in those areas
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally are deficient in copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he indicates symptoms include
abnormally small leaves and shoot dieback
[SPEAKER_01]: during the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that this has occurred in
northern high bush and Midwest to
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there are fixed copper
fungicides that are suitable sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper salts can potentially injure
tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that should be used
with caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, copper and molybdenum are
rarely, if ever, deficient under our
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, I wanted to mention
fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, of course, the injection of
fertilizers through trickle irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason this is appealing is it's
so convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a way of increasing the
efficiency of fertilizer use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for berries in the ground, fertigation
is most useful for delivering nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes potassium or phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big advantages are greater control
over nutrient placement and timing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result, improved efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less fertilizer may be required.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some caveats to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then disadvantages, of course,
are there's capital investments in
[SPEAKER_01]: injector and tanks and backflow valves and
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some maintenance and
management costs involved in this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these typical fertilizers,
very soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate,
calcium nitrate, very high solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium materials are somewhat lower in
solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: These solubility levels are pounds of
product per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 pounds per gallon is extremely high
solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to mention that these levels are
all measured at 70 degree water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the solubility of all the materials is
lower the colder the water gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using well water,
you may find that water will take maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: half as much of these materials as you can
get into solution at 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: One precaution is don't mix calcium with
sulfates or phosphates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're mixing up batch solutions for
fertigation, this is a general rule of
[SPEAKER_01]: thumb that these will cause precipitation
and plugging problems as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're all probably familiar with a
jar test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can always take proportions of
these materials and mix them up in a jar
[SPEAKER_01]: to test for mixtures and concentrations
that result in precipitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fertigation for blotting blueberries
and brambles, some general thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I think if you're new to this,
you can probably reduce your annual rate
[SPEAKER_01]: by about a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's assuming there's improved
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would start with is to split
that annual rate into multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, beginning two to three weeks
after bud break and continuing through
[SPEAKER_01]: July for blueberries and into August for
brambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fertigate weekly or every two
weeks or you can fertigate every time you
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I think the efficiency that you
gain, you would gain, that would be gained
[SPEAKER_01]: from a split application with three or
four application dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably wouldn't improve on that too
much by even continual fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fertigation can be very efficient
assuming that, first, your irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system has high uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the Midwest and the Northeast,
we're usually irrigating to supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your irrigation system's not
particularly uniform, it's not such a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're supplying all your nutrition
through that irrigation and the uniformity
[SPEAKER_01]: is poor, then that becomes a bigger deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients are applied when demand is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're fertigating and you're
applying nutrients before bud break,
[SPEAKER_01]: before the bushes are able to utilize the
nutrients, then you probably won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: achieving the efficiency that you could be
if you're applying them when the demand is
[SPEAKER_01]: highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also assuming that plants are not
over irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're irrigating and pulsing
fertilizer through the system and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're irrigating heavily afterwards,
it's very easy to push that nitrogen down
[SPEAKER_01]: through the profile and out of reach of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just a ditch dug across a
raspberry row under a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the trickle irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to illustrate, if you deliver
your nitrogen where you should deliver it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you over irrigate after that,
it's very easy to push it down below the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting system of the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here again, you lose the efficiency
that you might have gained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a question about any economic analyses
of fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of any per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't really think of any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that would be useful if it were
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just about out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to thank Marvin and Kathy in
particular for organizing this webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: series.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's been real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there any closing questions or
particularly comments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you'd like to discuss further?
[SPEAKER_01]: A question, what guidelines for irrigation
frequency?
[SPEAKER_01]: An inch per week in summer, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go to the strawberry, blueberry,
and raspberry production guides out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those publications do a great job
of summarizing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That information in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blueberries and raspberries in
Michigan, we always talk about an inch of
[SPEAKER_01]: water per week through the season as a
rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you can generally do quite a
bit better than that if you have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more information available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question, generally, when blueberries are
mulched, they say to increase nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: rates a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: But doesn't that end get released
eventually as the mulch breaks down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does it disappear?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a perennial cropping system like that,
over time, you would eventually get to
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium, where the nitrogen supplied
the prior year will be partly released
[SPEAKER_01]: through microbial decomposition of the
older material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right that if you're applying a
fresh mulch underneath blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: that effect on nitrogen availability
really is during the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, you may find that you can go
back to a rate that is consistent with a
[SPEAKER_01]: site that didn't have mulch applied to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in reality, a lot of growers would be
applying mulch every second.
[SPEAKER_01]: third, or fourth year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd have to make those adjustments
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob is asking, have you seen times where
applications of nitrogen are accidentally
[SPEAKER_01]: doubled or tripled?
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably have seen those, but I haven't
known them at the time, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: With blueberries in particular,
what's striking to me is how slow they are
[SPEAKER_01]: to react to fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we've done fertilizer trials where
some of the treatments get a high rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, some of them get no nitrogen,
it often takes two or three or even four
[SPEAKER_01]: years before you see a response in the
bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with these perennial plants like
blueberries, and probably to some extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries, they tend to respond slowly
to good things and bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlie was asking, cranberries also,
and I assume you're asking about response
[SPEAKER_01]: to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cranberries are quite a bit more
responsive to nitrogen than blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you do in a particular year,
you'll see the response to that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a question, would a cover crop be
helpful in tying up some of the excess
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen late in the season?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great point, and it's
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Michigan, a standard cover cropping
system is August or September seeded
[SPEAKER_01]: annual rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of the benefit of that
rye is it tends to soak up some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: excess of fertility in the soil and
perhaps make that available the next
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Cathy is saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to sign off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what that means, Cathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Eric, for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have another webinar next week,
and Cathy will be sending out information
[SPEAKER_00]: on that during the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a good day, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, Eric and Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to you all next week.
Bye.
Thank you.
