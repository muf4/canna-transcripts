[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Sweeney, who is a policy analyst and
works 150% for Ag and Markets,
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% of that on hemp and 50% on his real
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tim is just going to give us a little
overview of the current regulatory status
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Ag and Markets perspective and
then I'm sure he'd be happy to take all of
[SPEAKER_03]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to start off with a little
background on the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: As many of you probably know, the 2014
federal farm bill was the law that allowed
[SPEAKER_09]: us to begin this whole adventure in the
first place and subsequently now the 2018
[SPEAKER_09]: farm bill has expanded the program and
changed it somewhat, whereas hemp is no
[SPEAKER_09]: longer a controlled substance federally.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, until we have guidelines from the
federal government from the USDA in
[SPEAKER_09]: particular, we are continuing to operate
under the 2014 program guidelines.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to keep that in mind that it
is not yet a fully free market out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You still need to register with the state
and you will even after the 2018 program
[SPEAKER_09]: is fully enforced.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of the requirements of the
federal farm bill.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the farm bill requires that the USDA
now take charge of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes it out of the realm of the DEA as
it's no longer a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say as an aside though,
New York law has not quite caught up yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So technically hemp is still a controlled
substance in New York state, but we're
[SPEAKER_09]: working on fixing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the USDA now is in the process of
establishing their regulations to run the
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp program for the entire nation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once their regs come out, once their
program guidelines come out, each state
[SPEAKER_09]: that wants to host a program will have to
apply to the USDA.
[SPEAKER_09]: The USDA will have to approve the state
program and after that we will do rule
[SPEAKER_09]: making in New York state, which will then,
for those of you who are in the program,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're familiar with the research partner
agreements, we expect that the
[SPEAKER_09]: requirements to have those will go away
and we'll be running the program pursuant
[SPEAKER_09]: to regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, all of those requirements for
the research partner agreements remain in
[SPEAKER_09]: force and the 2014 farm bill remains in
force.
[SPEAKER_09]: One exception that any of you who wanted
to get a seed in the past from a foreign
[SPEAKER_09]: source, know what you had to go through
with us for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to apply to the DEA to get an
import permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would then send the paperwork back to
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would send your permit to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: The seed would have to be delivered to our
office in Albany and then you'd have to
[SPEAKER_09]: come and get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That has all gone away now as the DEA is
no longer requiring and will not issue any
[SPEAKER_09]: import permits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Early on this year there was kind of a bit
of confusion where the DEA said we're not
[SPEAKER_09]: issuing permits and the government in
Canada said well, we're not sending seed
[SPEAKER_09]: to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: without a permit so we were kind of in a
tough spot there but we finally worked all
[SPEAKER_09]: of that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no longer any DEA permits
required and you do not have to come to
[SPEAKER_09]: Albany to pick up your seed anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be delivered directly to you and
any of you that had the misfortune of
[SPEAKER_09]: having to come to our office to get the
seed will appreciate how big a deal that
[SPEAKER_09]: is.
[SPEAKER_09]: So over the years since the 2014 farm bill
started this all off, 2016 was the year
[SPEAKER_09]: was our first year that we had a crop in
the ground in New York State and the
[SPEAKER_09]: program has grown like crazy since then.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're up to just over 500 growers
now and that represents about 18,000 acres
[SPEAKER_09]: approved for growing in New York State.
[SPEAKER_09]: About 75% of that, a question was asked in
the morning session how much of the
[SPEAKER_09]: acreage is devoted to CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: About 75% is CBD would be a good guess I
think.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're currently taking applications for
growing for fiber grain and CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're currently taking applications for
processing of fiber and grain.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not however accepting any
applications right now for processing CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: and we don't know when that will open up
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I expect it will but I really have no idea
when that would be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me make sure I'm not missing anything
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, with regard to CBD, CBD and food
according to the FDA and the FDA still has
[SPEAKER_09]: oversight over CBD that was pretty clear
in the federal farm bill that nothing in
[SPEAKER_09]: the farm bill undid FDA law and so as far
as the FDA is concerned you cannot add CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: to food and you cannot sell CBD as a
dietary supplement.
[SPEAKER_09]: New York State, we have a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add CBD to products that look like
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: If those products are made as a dietary
supplement in a GMP facility and following
[SPEAKER_09]: all the code of federal regulation
sections that apply to dietary
[SPEAKER_09]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_09]: The product would then have to be labeled
as a dietary supplement, marketed as a
[SPEAKER_09]: dietary supplement, and sold as a dietary
supplement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are a little bit different than some
other states in that regard but we do
[SPEAKER_09]: allow CBD in those products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone have any questions so far?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm pretty much covered everything
that I needed to tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: For now the application process remains
the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: You apply to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still a $500 fee.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a three-year application,
a three-year license that you would be
[SPEAKER_09]: granted.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would go through the process of having
to do the research partner agreement and
[SPEAKER_09]: having that notarized and returned to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would need to still be sampled 21 days
prior to when you want to harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: You contact us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We will send a horticulture inspector out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to fill out what's called a
harvest report form with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our horticulture inspectors will come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll sample your crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send the sample back to our food lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do the regulatory test and then you'd be
good to go if your crop is within legal
[SPEAKER_02]: limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's within 21 days.
[SPEAKER_09]: You apply to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You send in the harvest report form which
is more like a harvest request.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a harvest request form.
[SPEAKER_09]: So within 21 days of when you want to
harvest, is when you should send that form
[SPEAKER_09]: to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we will do our best to get an
inspector.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're shooting for within a
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two to three days in my experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two to three days, Larry says,
has been his experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say to stores that are selling
CBD products that can be shipped anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: nationally?
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not within the purview of our
program.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have told people that if they are
selling a product that the FDA considers
[SPEAKER_09]: illegal, they are definitely in a,
you know, they could be in a bind there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's somewhat of a gray area as to
what is allowed and what isn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But some of it's very plain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the FDA, if they choose to enforce,
they could take enforcement action.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot sell any raw flour in New York
State to anyone outside the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you cannot make any smokable or
vapable products in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your timeline once the FDA has
established guidelines, FTC or whatever it
[SPEAKER_06]: needs for cross border transactions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you expecting to come out about the
same time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously you're going to have to review,
do some policy looking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're talking about when the USDA
issues their program?
[SPEAKER_06]: When do you expect to come out with state
after?
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as possible is the answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's not a great answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are, I spoke with the woman who runs
the Ag Marketing Services section at the
[SPEAKER_09]: USDA and they're tasked with developing
the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said that they are on track for
early fall release of the USDA program
[SPEAKER_09]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then we will do everything in our power
to get our program submitted to them in a
[SPEAKER_09]: timely fashion and get it back out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would certainly hope that we would be
running under the new program for next
[SPEAKER_09]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of variables in potential
hang ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was whether or not CBD
smokeable flour is allowed in New York
[SPEAKER_09]: State.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_09]: In our program you cannot sell raw flour
to anyone outside the program.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it cannot do any smokeable or vapeable
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not in our program or they're
violating their program agreement with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's the case, then they could be
expelled from the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to speculate on legislation
that hasn't passed yet and may actually
[SPEAKER_09]: look a lot different than the old
legislation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it would look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is the model that was in the
previous legislation was that CBD would be
[SPEAKER_09]: under that new program.
[SPEAKER_11]: In order for it to be industrial hemp,
it has to be .3 or below THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what the legislation,
if any, would look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they would write something
in the law that would address that.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I will say that the federal level
is .3.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to be held to the federal
standard to get our program approved.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the best I can give you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the federal standard, it says any
piece of the plant has to test at .3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just hearing what we're talking about,
anything that's above 6% is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting closer to that hot value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a way to, how do we navigate
that going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, anticipating just taking the flour
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take just isolating the flour,
most stuff out there is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you blend it all together as
biomass, then it's not going to be hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a sampling protocol for the top 10
centimeters of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the one that we're sticking
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to be consistent with what
other states do as well so that there
[SPEAKER_09]: wouldn't be any situation where New York
state products might have some taint to
[SPEAKER_09]: them with regard to interstate
transportation if we weren't held to the
[SPEAKER_09]: same standard as other people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question is with regard to some
marijuana plants that are showing up in
[SPEAKER_09]: fields that are planted to some other crop
or to hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically saying, what's the
possibility of having unlicensed growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no regulation that would address
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you worried about if your field tested
hot because of that crop?
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope that the randomness of our
sampling protocol would take that worry
[SPEAKER_09]: away.
[SPEAKER_09]: If that wasn't the case and if it was a
special circumstance that you could prove
[SPEAKER_09]: that there was some renegade crop growing
there, we could probably take a look at
[SPEAKER_09]: that, have our inspectors come back out
and see exactly what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until it falls into law enforcement's
hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one last question for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you have a published procedure for
how you will handle a non-compliant test?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what will be the steps that you or law
enforcement will take after that
[SPEAKER_03]: non-compliant test?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be a second test?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will law enforcement be brought to the
field?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: Larry always has to do this to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask me a question I don't know the answer
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: That procedure, that policy has not yet
been established, but we are going to have
[SPEAKER_09]: to come up with a destruction policy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not our intention to be law
enforcement or take the place of law
[SPEAKER_09]: enforcement's jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody in our program ends up with a
field that's hot, we will work with them
[SPEAKER_09]: to destroy the crop and our first call is
not going to be to law enforcement to get
[SPEAKER_09]: them jammed up in a legal proceeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want this program to succeed and we
want our program participants to succeed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll do everything we can within the
law and we have to keep in mind that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to have the federal government
looking at us to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing everything we need to do to stay
compliant with their requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks a lot Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to follow along,
it's a little bit different than some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other hemp handouts because the entire
first page is about the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure there's a lot of growers from
different, not just hemp in the group and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had a couple rough years,
the last two.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 was the first time we got an actual
spring planting of hemp and it was wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a wet spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted late in some of our locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had lots of pythium, so we lost a lot
of seedlings to that and then it sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into like this beautiful summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our seedlings that survived the
pythium grew beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had amazing yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at other trials from around
the country and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, we can definitely grow hemp for
grain and fiber in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a beautiful, long,
dry, warm fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything got harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our highest yielding cultivar for grain
was over a ton per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of people that are wanting
to follow along but didn't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: handouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our grain, our fiber yields were
also really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had six and a half dry tons per acre
was our biomass produced and that was in
[SPEAKER_01]: 72 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we had a pretty wet spring so we
planted a little bit later than we had
[SPEAKER_01]: hoped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally things dried out enough
to plant and it was like someone could
[SPEAKER_01]: turn the faucet off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had five to six weeks of just
drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had pretty poor seedling stands and
then in addition to that, because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: drought, we had a lot like stunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants were just stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, we were watching it, you know,
watching it like, you can do it plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're little cheerleaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought we might be okay because
the wheat, it was dry enough that the
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds weren't growing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rain started coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone prayed way too hard for rain
last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the key because once it
started, it didn't stop until the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weeds just took off and the weeds
outgrew all of our shorter varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like I said, it didn't,
it just didn't stop raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had some big disease pressure
later on in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our grain yields were half that of what
they were the year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fiber yields weren't impacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearly as much, but they were still four
and a half tons versus six and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half tons is still a lot of
biomass to produce in 75 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just still wasn't because the
stands weren't as good to start out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't as good as the new year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our grains yields were at less,
are about half as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a nice graph on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this data, we had 13 grain
varieties in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then four fiber types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had the four fiber types in 2018,
but we added to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up having closer to 25 grain
and dual purpose type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't include that information in
here because I just wanted to compare the
[SPEAKER_01]: same varieties in both years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the big difference that we saw
in the grain that we harvested was the
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium on the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to talk about that too much
because Gary will be up here in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so there was a detectable vomit toxin
in some of our trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially trials that were in
locations around areas where a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: other wheat and barley and oats are
produced, those ones have very high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our highest detectable level of vomit
toxin was 36.6 parts per million on some
[SPEAKER_01]: of our hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cutoff for food is one to two
parts per million, depending on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: main use is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't know, looking at this
grain and seeing 36.6 parts per million
[SPEAKER_01]: was a shock for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other other quality components of the
grain were different as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2017, it was close to 36% oil in the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was less, it was around 29% in
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big drop there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just you could you could look at the
grain and see it was not of the right
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weathered looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots more broken pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see discoloration from the
disease all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my head, in my head, we had one
awesome year, which can show the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like New York can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed, the seed sources are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year, it was just like,
Whoa, we're going to need some more tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're going to be able to manage
this and really keep this going as a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our all of our certified seed lots
were fine for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing came even close to the 0.3% limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was asking if the the fusarium was a
blue wind from the neighboring fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is very likely the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year was a really bad year for
fusarium on all of the small grains and
[SPEAKER_01]: corn and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all over just a really bad year for
fusarium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg Carlson, just going to give a quick
update on our breeding program here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so these cultivar trials are really
good at informing New York farmers,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they also inform breeders like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our breeding program is primarily focused
on developing disease resistant,
[SPEAKER_05]: high yielding varieties with decent oil
and protein content and diverse
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we make selections from some of these
cultivars that we've tested in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been doing this for the past like
three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we identified a subset of high
yielding dual purpose cultivars that have
[SPEAKER_05]: good grain yield along with good
cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did is we took seed lots from
these particular varieties and grew them
[SPEAKER_05]: out in seed flats.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we made early selections at the
seedling stage based on plant seedling
[SPEAKER_05]: vigor or height, lack of disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from there we're using high
throughput molecular markers to first
[SPEAKER_05]: identify cannabinoid type or hemp type or
marijuana type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can create progeny that are
homozygous hemp type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make hemp populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to make hemp marijuana
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that a lot of these cultivars from
the last couple years have been
[SPEAKER_05]: segregating for hemp and marijuana type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to talk to Jacob,
he's in our lab, he talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to talk to me about that more
or Jacob more, just come up and ask us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so what we do is we're screening these
plants for a cannabinoid type and then
[SPEAKER_05]: what we want to do is select from that
subset a percentage of females and a
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of males that are hemp type.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll bring in hemp type females
into greenhouse ranges, different
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties of these hemp females and
introduce them to a single male cultivar
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've also screened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from there we bulk those seeds and
we'll bulk those seeds, clean it and plant
[SPEAKER_05]: it out in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we planted out I think 10
crosses and we're still working on some
[SPEAKER_05]: more in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also done some feminized populations
that we're doing selections on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from there we'll make selections in the
field.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll make selections in the field,
bring them into the greenhouse and use
[SPEAKER_05]: those for our future process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have to really rely on
isolation, so we don't have to fear pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually wanting to go out,
do some cultivar evaluations in the field,
[SPEAKER_05]: all in one big field instead of isolated
blocks three miles apart from one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, we just don't have the tools to
do that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've also evaluated different feral
populations from Wisconsin, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nebraska and some New York feral
populations, as well as different
[SPEAKER_05]: feminized populations and dioecious
populations of varying pedigrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be interesting to see what kind of
traits we can garner from those
[SPEAKER_05]: populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, like Larry said, we're doing
genotyping just to look at the genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity of the plants that New York
farmers are planting around the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done this for a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well we have two plates of GBS,
or it's genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our genotyping method.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to submit another plate
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in getting your
plants that you're growing, genotyped,
[SPEAKER_05]: there won't be any cost to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just will visit your field,
collect your sample from your plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we'll share it with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be as open as possible in our
breeding program, in our genotyping
[SPEAKER_05]: program, and we'll offer that,
we'll throw that up online so you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: where your plants sit in the entire,
what was that, the galaxy of your of our
[SPEAKER_05]: genetic diversity that we see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick question.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, just come up and talk to me if
you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a sign up sheet, and if you know
your cultivar is off hand, you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: write those down.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just give just the two second
summary of what we've learned so far,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we haven't gotten our second set of 95
samples back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every variety is named according to
its genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes names don't match genetics,
and that can be interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also that we do see groupings of
different cultivars into distinct genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would like to expand that analysis
with another 95 samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in doing that,
please let us know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks very much, Craig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly with a new crop on the
landscape, the risk of diseases is
[SPEAKER_03]: imminent, and we're very fortunate to have
Gary Bergstrom here to talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: surveys and the characterizations they've
done of hemp diseases so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to start out by acknowledging
two people in my lab that are really at
[SPEAKER_07]: the forefront of our diagnostic effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jen Starr, Kevin Myers, would you stand up
there?
[SPEAKER_07]: And all three of us will be around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd love to visit with you about
things that you think may be diseases that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're seeing in your fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we will all agree we're still
learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the third year of our effort
in surveillance to try to find out what's
[SPEAKER_07]: going on in commercial fields of hemp,
as well as in some of the kind of variety
[SPEAKER_07]: trials that you've seen here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you noticed, it was by and large
pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: We found that little bit of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did collect a few very minor leaf
spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you may have noticed a few plants
showing wilting on one side of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's some fusarium wilt in a
relatively few plants out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with certainty, as we intensify
production of this crop like any other
[SPEAKER_07]: crop we grow, if we have it grown in more
fields and have it grown more intensively
[SPEAKER_07]: with greater frequency and not in any
particular field, we're likely to see
[SPEAKER_07]: eventually an increase in some of our
disease problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the onset here, we're trying to
record everything, even some insignificant
[SPEAKER_07]: little spot on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to find out what organism
causes it, you know, is there super
[SPEAKER_07]: susceptibility in some of our varieties,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to get a handle on all of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're very interested in collaborating
with all of you, a lot more eyes and ears
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We certainly aren't getting to the vast
majority of your field.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep us in mind, either through your
Cooperative Extension educator in your
[SPEAKER_07]: local area, and a number of them are here
with us today, or contact me or those in
[SPEAKER_07]: my lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be very interested in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this point, where are we?
[SPEAKER_07]: We basically want to minimize diseases as
a factor in the production of this crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since you've already heard a couple of
times, we don't have registered legal,
[SPEAKER_07]: available, and efficacious fungicides as
one of the tools at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this will change over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have very good agronomic practices
that we can put in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can, for starters, put a lot of
emphasis on site selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've heard that the sites on your farm
where you're going to grow the crop,
[SPEAKER_07]: we need a well-drained site, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pythium is going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not going to be adapted to every
field on your farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also know right off the bat that this
is a crop that is very susceptible to
[SPEAKER_07]: white mold fungus, the sclerotinia fungus,
which is a very wide host range fungus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is already a principal problem
for us in this state in growing crops like
[SPEAKER_07]: dry beans, snap beans, soybeans,
a number of other vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know that if we have white mold
problem in those other crops, it's only
[SPEAKER_07]: going to lead to a white mold problem in
the hemp if we follow those in rotation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So being aware of not only the hemp and
the hemp varieties, but what is the
[SPEAKER_07]: previous cropping history in the field is
very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to hear in a little bit here
from Dr. Alan Taylor, who's going to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about some of the pioneering work on
looking at efficacy of different synthetic
[SPEAKER_07]: chemicals and biological materials for
application to seed to try to get some
[SPEAKER_07]: control of some of these seed-borne and
early-growth soil-borne microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I won't say a lot about that other than
to say that that is a critical issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably where we need pesticides the
most is getting that seed out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground, getting a vigorous initial stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully that will be one of the first
developments in that arena.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a good seed bed is important as well
to really prepare the ground well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much anybody is planting
in a no-till situation right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has some, probably not too much,
and that's probably just as well because
[SPEAKER_07]: that has some other complications as well
as far as seed emergence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And depending on what the crop residue
from the previous crop, we could be
[SPEAKER_07]: carrying along pathogens from a previous
crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my biggest concern are at the two ends
of the growing season, getting that
[SPEAKER_07]: seedling out of the ground, getting it
protected that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also, in our program, we're
putting a lot of current emphasis on the
[SPEAKER_07]: end-of-the-season kind of problems of
diseases and also mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that's nearly universal
that I've seen in looking at fields is
[SPEAKER_07]: botrytis gray mold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has that gray, webby growth all
over the floral parts and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be problematic for any
end use, you know, kind of an anti-quality
[SPEAKER_07]: factor there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There may or may not turn out to be some
varietal differences along that line,
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully, that we could see something
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, I know Chris's group is doing
some work with some of the same chemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's looking against powdery mildew,
interested in finding something that might
[SPEAKER_07]: have efficacy against botrytis as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm concentrating very much on the fungi
that will colonize the finished product,
[SPEAKER_07]: either the grain, the seed, or those buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we find is a predominance of
fusarium fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And fusarium is notorious for producing
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've spent the better part of my
career working in cereal crops where the
[SPEAKER_07]: principal problem has been fusarium head
blight and contamination of the grain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was at least a mild surprise to
me to start looking at quality in the hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: and finding that those same problems are
very prevalent there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're finding a diversity of fusarium
species, particularly fusarium
[SPEAKER_07]: gruminiarum, which is the principal
problem we have on corn and small grain
[SPEAKER_07]: cereals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which does, in the long term, open up the
whole crop rotation question a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: as well, because the wisdom would be,
if we're having problems with white mold
[SPEAKER_07]: and we have some commonality with maybe
some of our diseases of vegetables in some
[SPEAKER_07]: cases, that grain crops would be a great
rotation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a caveat on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that we have to be conscious
of how fusarium might be building up in
[SPEAKER_07]: the grain crop that precedes the hemp
crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a lot to learn about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we may, you know, get super lucky
and find a variety or some genes in
[SPEAKER_07]: particular that would confer resistance to
fusarium, but I wouldn't hold out a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: hope on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working in cereal systems for my
fourth decade now, and it is still an
[SPEAKER_07]: elusive problem genetically.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been able to basically sort out
the super susceptible varieties and kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of push them to the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have found genetic control that
moderates, you know, kind of intermediate
[SPEAKER_07]: level of resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, when it rains, when the crops
flower and we have the fungus in the air,
[SPEAKER_07]: we will get fusarium developed and we will
have mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, maybe scared you a little bit about
that one figure, about 36 parts per
[SPEAKER_07]: million, and that I'm hoping is an extreme
case, but we've been looking at seed lots
[SPEAKER_07]: from the last couple of years and it's not
unusual to have four, five, six parts per
[SPEAKER_07]: million.
[SPEAKER_07]: The FDA guidelines for any human food
product is one part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so there will be some effort made to
try to bring things down to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we're actively
looking at in our research program is
[SPEAKER_07]: we're looking at the possibility of both
organically approved type fungicide
[SPEAKER_07]: materials, bio fungicides, as well as more
traditional chemical fungicides,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're applying that at the outset of
flowering on the crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some experiment, we're doing some
timings on that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would like to see what potential
that has in bringing down, suppressing the
[SPEAKER_07]: levels of this deoxynovolinol toxin in the
grain or in the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something we feel is pretty high
priority right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about kind of in the middle of the
growing season, we've seen an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen some of these vascular wilt
disorders, haven't seen a complete wipeout
[SPEAKER_07]: of many fields of that, but we've seen
some serious problems in a couple cases
[SPEAKER_07]: with Pythium root rot that starts early in
the season and progresses into killing
[SPEAKER_07]: whole plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also the Fusarium fungus in soils can do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have seen some stray plants in the
plots this morning that showed Fusarium
[SPEAKER_07]: wilt.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have seen is a whole diversity of
fungal leaf spots, and some of them really
[SPEAKER_07]: very minor, you know, have to look a long
way in a row and find a couple spots here
[SPEAKER_07]: and there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of diseases, in particular
one we call bipolaris leaf spot that seems
[SPEAKER_07]: some connection with varieties as well,
but it can be severe blighting of the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will be looking primarily at genetic
varietal selection in the future as a
[SPEAKER_07]: means of combating some of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we look forward to working together
with Larry's program and others here to
[SPEAKER_07]: try to get a better handle on those
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're into Latin names,
there's a few on that sheet there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all kinds of genera of fungi that
we have found associated with these
[SPEAKER_07]: blights.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're methodically working through
proving their pathogenicity, isolating
[SPEAKER_07]: them in pure culture, inoculating them
onto different varieties of hemp in the
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse and seeing to what extent they
are pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another interesting question is the host
range of some of these pathogenic
[SPEAKER_07]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, we found some organisms that
we haven't proven yet, but very similar
[SPEAKER_07]: organism found on the weeds nearby in our
hemp plots.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be that weed control is also
important in, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_07]: epidemiology of some of these diseases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a tremendous amount to learn,
and we look forward to you being students
[SPEAKER_07]: along with us and help us to learn some of
these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are there some questions or some
observations you'd like to share?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the question was whether we have
found any difference in susceptibility,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you will, between the monaceous and
dioecious varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're basically just looking,
we're not inoculating anything,
[SPEAKER_07]: so there's no controlled experiments to do
that comparison.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can't definitively describe that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vast majority of the varieties in
fields and settings we've seen so far,
[SPEAKER_07]: disease is fairly uncommon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the plants of all types are
looking, well I won't say resistant,
[SPEAKER_07]: because they may not have been exposed to
the inoculum.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't have any general observation
on that line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there some information anybody's aware
of along that line?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that observation,
and we can try to look at that a little
[SPEAKER_07]: more closely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just curious if anybody that's been
growing the crop has had any significant
[SPEAKER_07]: production issue with disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to be the only one,
so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, come talk to me privately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our last speaker of the afternoon is
Dr. Alan Taylor, who is a seed scientist
[SPEAKER_03]: here at Cornell Agritech and has been
doing some research on seed treatments and
[SPEAKER_03]: their interaction with soil pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Larry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see quite a number of speakers
that we have today.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, I want to say as a seed guy,
to be a part of the Cornell hemp team has
[SPEAKER_08]: been really rewarding with this project.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pathologists, plant breeders, a cadre of
people in their expertise that Chris and
[SPEAKER_08]: Larry have really pooled together their
expertise so we can move together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's been really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my program in the area of seed science
and technology, besides what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be talking to you on the seed treatment
project today, is we also try to provide
[SPEAKER_08]: support to the ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we're looking at some of the seed
lots that are coming in, we'll do the
[SPEAKER_08]: germination purity to seed quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're doing that in conjunction with a
larger project to kind of move everything
[SPEAKER_08]: forward, so we all kind of learn together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim talked about in his presentation from
Ag and Markets about the big picture going
[SPEAKER_08]: on with the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, if I go back a year ago,
when we started working with the seed
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments to really pitch this to this
IR4 group, which is the national group,
[SPEAKER_08]: which fosters registration for specialty
crops, it kind of got hemp as considered
[SPEAKER_08]: as a specialty crop, but that they would
be working on biological and chemical seed
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that time, just a year ago at this
time before the 2018 farm bill was passed,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was all the industrial hemp,
CBD hemp was lumped in with the
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational cannabis, so there's no
pesticides were labeled on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is really a void.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there's already very mature
materials, especially the chemical seed
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments, that are already there and you
use this if you grow any other crops or
[SPEAKER_08]: even biological.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really, our project was kind of to pull
some of this together, some of these
[SPEAKER_08]: promising materials that have already been
used commercially on other crops to see
[SPEAKER_08]: how they're going to work on hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Gary who just talked
about, first of all, the need,
[SPEAKER_08]: really the need of getting this crop,
a direct seeded crop for an industrial,
[SPEAKER_08]: for either fiber or for grain,
to get it established in the seed
[SPEAKER_08]: treatments and how that can help that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Gary's group, have been very
supportive in providing the pathology
[SPEAKER_08]: support for this project as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's fortunate, again, getting back to
this IR4 group, again, that their whole
[SPEAKER_08]: purpose is to foster registration.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have what's called their integrated
solutions, which is one of their large
[SPEAKER_08]: programs, which become a multi-regional.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have field studies we'll be talking
about from Cornell at two locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have field studies in the southern
region at Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also at North Dakota State in the
north central region there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we did this, we've used one
variety of Anka as a dual purpose variety
[SPEAKER_08]: and Anka's been kind of our white rat that
we do for a lot of our seed quality
[SPEAKER_08]: investigations, good quality seed lot to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've developed my laboratory,
I'm kind of working off of this handout if
[SPEAKER_08]: you have it, the evaluation of seed
treatments on industrial crops for
[SPEAKER_08]: management.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a laboratory scale seed
treatment equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: My program's pretty unique in the United
States for having small scale equipment
[SPEAKER_08]: that we can basically simulate what a
larger seed company would be doing on
[SPEAKER_08]: treating many, many pounds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can treat just an ounce of seed,
which is fine for most of our trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're able to do that in house.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a lot of screening on what seed
treatment binders, some of the particulars
[SPEAKER_08]: that I'm not going to go into here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the first thing we want to do is we're
amassing these materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at biologicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Biologicals are two major biocontrol
agents.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's either a beneficial fungi,
trichoderma, or a beneficial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_08]: which are bacillus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also had chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Syngenta is the only chemical company that
stepped up a year ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So very mature materials, the Apron XL
Maxim materials that are widely registered
[SPEAKER_08]: on vegetable as well as field crops.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have biochemical materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the chemical group are called
phosphites.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know phosphate as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the phosphites are unique that they're
systemic materials, but also have been
[SPEAKER_08]: shown in other systems to control pythium.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wanted to include that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number of pathogens, pythium, just like,
again, Gary kind of set the stage for me
[SPEAKER_08]: to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: The pythium has kind of been our key
target pathogen, but also fusarium and
[SPEAKER_08]: rhizoctonia that can be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a laboratory bioassay that we
screened materials early on just to look
[SPEAKER_08]: at application rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if there's any potential
phytotoxicity as we're applying materials,
[SPEAKER_08]: again, for the first time on hemp,
we don't know what that seed treatment
[SPEAKER_08]: crop combination is going to yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did all that type of background
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're interested in the data,
it's on the back sheet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to try to simplify, because there's 15
treatments, and rather than to try to go
[SPEAKER_08]: through all this, we color coded this to
really kind of simplify.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't have it, you can almost
see it from here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stand improves here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we see all these treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: In blue are the chemical seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the apron XL maxim combination
doing very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you would expect that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very well-developed chemistries
for control.
[SPEAKER_08]: The two black treatments are the
non-treated seeds, so that's our check.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all these greens are the
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the biologicals in our hands on hemp is
affording really no appreciable protection
[SPEAKER_08]: against early season damping off.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just based on our two field
studies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the field study conducted in East
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank Jamie, who just talked
to you a few minutes ago, helping
[SPEAKER_08]: coordinate that site.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Geneva site that Larry's
group was very supportive in helping us
[SPEAKER_08]: getting that one launched as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're really at the first year with
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point in time, I'm still waiting
for the data from the Virginia Tech sites
[SPEAKER_08]: and the North Dakota so we can start
filling this in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, that's really the purpose of
having a multi-state, multi-region
[SPEAKER_08]: project, is in case we have flukes in our
data, we want to see what sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: consistent trends there would be over the
long run.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in communication now with all the
companies, four biological companies,
[SPEAKER_08]: the chemical company, things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are too abreast of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be, our plans right now
would be to continue this project for the
[SPEAKER_08]: second year.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be tweaking some things,
going back to kind of the drawing board
[SPEAKER_08]: and looking, especially these biologicals,
try to improve their efficacy to get them
[SPEAKER_08]: to improve better, especially using
Pythium as our target pathogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of very quickly,
in a nutshell, kind of what we found.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any questions on this or other
seed questions, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Pythium, Fusarium, and Rhizoctonia are
kind of the three key that the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_08]: three key soil-borne pathogens that would
be attacking the seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, when we focus this,
when we had the naturally infested soil
[SPEAKER_08]: with Pythium, Gary's group did the
characterization of that Pythium for us so
[SPEAKER_08]: we know what pathogen, what species that
we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so with our TEL, roll TEL test,
which is kind of a seed testing procedure,
[SPEAKER_08]: then we can screen things, you know,
24-7, and so we can see kind of what's
[SPEAKER_08]: going on, which treatments are doing well,
which ones are not doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thanks, good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll turn this back over to Larry so
we can get on field.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
