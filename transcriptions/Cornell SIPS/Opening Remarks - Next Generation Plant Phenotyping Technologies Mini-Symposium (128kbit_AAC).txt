[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name, for those of you who don't know
me, is Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the interim director of the School
of Integrative Plant Science here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to be able to have
everyone here today for SIPP's first mini
[SPEAKER_00]: symposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that we can do more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mini symposium actually came from the
faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olena Vadamanyuk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to a meeting and came back
really inspired about high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she sort of started sending emails
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think by the time I was copied on an
email, the thread had about 45 messages in
[SPEAKER_00]: it of faculty in SIPP's that were all
enthusiastic about high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the many multidisciplinary activities
that could come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got copied in because someone said,
well, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we get funding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that, this mini symposium was
developed and also a white paper that we
[SPEAKER_00]: will use to try to advance high throughput
phenotyping here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I'm so excited about it
is because of the multidisciplinary aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: the coolest thing to me about SIPP's is
the breadth of research that we do from
[SPEAKER_00]: the most basic to the most applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the excitement of high
throughput phenotyping really spans all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have today someone from the soil and
crop science section and also plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly our breeders and folks in
agronomy are driving forces for high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a plant pathologist, I can say that
we want better, stronger, and faster ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify the amount or lack of disease
on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not exclusive to those that don't
work on diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that I wanted to say
this morning was that I'm hoping that from
[SPEAKER_00]: the talks that we hear today and from the
visitors that we have, we're so excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: have you here, that many of us will be
inspired and will be able to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this multidisciplinary dialogue and
move plant science at Cornell forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also be able to translate what we
learn here in high throughput phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: into agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture here in New York, across the
country, and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of ways that we need to
support our agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a really good
place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to introduce
Mike Gore, who is an associate professor
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is going to kick off our morning
first session.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
