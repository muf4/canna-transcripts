[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alina and Mike, for inviting
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me with this, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Alina said, I'm sort of known as a
root imaging and root analysis person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we're interested in how the
plant functions as a whole and how shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: and roots are integrated, the way a plant
actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is actually data from the PET
imaging system of my colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gyanchan Tai at the WashU Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually watching carbon being
fixed in the leaves and moving down into
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots in real time using PET.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you a little bit more about
how this works later in the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as I think we all understand,
if we want to understand the plant as an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated system, it's usually the roots
where we stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a classic image of two grass
roots interacting with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just one little shoot up here,
quite an extensive root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one scale, the architecture of
the root system that we can look at roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similarly, at each of these many
thousands of root tips, there's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: microenvironment here, the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the inside of a barley root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the root hairs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the microbiome is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of dynamic activity
across a lot of scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suffice it to say, roots are an
incredible challenge not just to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in their complexity at many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from an applied standpoint,
we often think about the concept of idiot
[SPEAKER_00]: type breeding, which was developed by CM
Donald in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an idiot type is basically a model
plant trait for a particular environment
[SPEAKER_00]: or agronomic practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a big deal in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a green revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to breed for certain plant
characters or plant traits rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: simply for yield or for reduced defects in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you might imagine, Donald didn't
have a lot to say about what the below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground idiot types are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, all the water, all the
nutrients, and quite a bit of interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: with the environment come through the
roots and through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really key area that we
focus on in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how those images that you saw,
this is from John Weaver's papers,
[SPEAKER_00]: really pioneered this sort of
archeological approach to seeing and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding root systems in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally what they were doing
through the early 1900s and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can imagine, the throughput was
quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, 85 years later,
we're literally, this is still state of
[SPEAKER_00]: the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not much hyperbole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so of the different ways that we can
actually look at roots in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one has a very limited perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very sparse idea of the whole root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a phenotypic reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a four dimensional reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these root tips is growing
along in its microenvironment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds up to a total architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the methods we can use today in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excavating soil cores, many rhizotrons,
which is a clear tube with a camera where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just see the roots growing along
the tube, or root crown excavations,
[SPEAKER_00]: AKA shovelomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just the idea here is that there's,
of course, useful information we can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's only a little sliver of the real
picture of phenotypic reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of a theme in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not only interested in seeing the
root system, but sort of making sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexity as well and tying different
forms of data together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, my group is interested in
understanding the genetic basis of root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and root environment interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we very much take a kitchen sink
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two general axes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just experiments we can control the
information content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other end, what's actually
relative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it field soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it actually relative to agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a number of different
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll touch on most of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we take the kitchen sink and we throw
it at what I like to call high-resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resolution is the resolution to
identify genes that are controlling these
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll tell you a little bit about
the Illinois Long-Term Selection
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment in Mays and how we're using
these tools to identify genes in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'll start with an imaging system
for looking at roots that was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: developed here in Leon Kochian's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, this is optical projection
tomography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many of Leon's former lab here
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy Clark was the one, and John Schaff,
who really pioneered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing more than growing plants in a
big glass jar with fertilizer and gel and
[SPEAKER_00]: spinning it around on a turntable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a camera and an
illuminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically capturing silhouette
images as we're rotating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we capture three-dimensional
information about the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, we can actually make a
three-dimensional model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have this model in hand,
we have to figure out what to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we literally have now a phenotypic
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we capture all the variation
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically, we start with the things
that we could measure maybe by hand or
[SPEAKER_00]: with a ruler previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into fancy stuff like
shape analysis, like topological features,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how the roots curve over time,
things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of information we can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like you to know to keep in mind
that these are really, they're discrete
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and they're ad hoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically our human idea of
what is important for the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some extent, this may be limiting
our ability to understand roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: identify genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you a little bit of an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm skipping ahead, but we used this
method to map the root architecture of a
[SPEAKER_00]: rice mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an upland and a lowland,
a rice, Balanassi, Sena, recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike explained QTLs and RILs earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what I'm showing you here is
just a few different chromosomes where we
[SPEAKER_00]: found QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, you can kind of see the
shaded areas, the color map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we found lots of QTLs,
these univariate QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we may have found one for
bushiness or one for root system volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even together in the same QTL
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we then, we're wondering, well,
which QTL should we actually pursue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of these traits actually matters
most?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we're working with Tom
Mitchell-Olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to get a perspective,
a multivariate perspective about
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Tom did is he took this whole list
of traits, everything we could measure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jill Anderson and Ray and his lab,
and just used a MANOVA and basically used
[SPEAKER_00]: a multivariate MANOVA as the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a similar thing would be to use a
principal component and map on a principal
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point of this slide is just to
show you, we found five multivariate QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in red here, and this is the
effect size, so they're pretty large.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red here, these are ones that we found
with the univariate traits previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already had evidence that there was
some genes controlling the trait of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in green here, there was no evidence
of univariate QTL, meaning we would not
[SPEAKER_00]: have found this using these discrete and
ad hoc traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a very important
concept in phenotyping in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think all the speakers this morning
have really hit on the fact that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of information and that together they
tell the picture and maybe not alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really beautiful thing about this
gel, albeit an artificial system,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, is it's non-destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can actually look at the fourth
dimension in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about plant-environment
interactions or dynamics or processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these words involve time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They imply time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to not look at them over time is
severely limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at two maize and
bread lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there's very different
root architectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we would like to know is how the
growth of each of these individual roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it goes from one root to many hundreds
of roots over the course of seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that process is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are they different as a function of
time in their growth processes rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: just a static time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an automated imaging system we
have in the lab at just every four hours
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we decide to program it at,
it runs day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get these really nice
time-resolved data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also developed software.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Dynamic Roots published a couple
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes these 3D models and allows us to
actually measure the growth of each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual root in the context of the
whole root system over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can track individual roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at a very highly resolved
level temporally and spatially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is work of Ni Jiang, a postdoc in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just these two different maize
genotypes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at root length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just focus here,
it's shown as a density plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a function of the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically in blue here, these are
relatively shorter roots compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively longer roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same here for Missouri 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just to show you that the
beginning B73 has relatively longer roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that continues for some period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, there's really a flush
of lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the architecture continues with
many smaller roots rather than many longer
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Missouri 17 over time invests more
in the roots that it actually has and
[SPEAKER_00]: grows these lateral roots out rather than
making more new ones, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really could be thought of as a
foraging strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a growth characteristic
that has implications for how the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to forage for nutrients and resources
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see that clearly,
depending on where you looked at your
[SPEAKER_00]: trade of interest, you would get different
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you looked here, it tells you one
thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you get a different answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly, this is just the number of
lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what I showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see they're very similar
numbers until some point at which B73
[SPEAKER_00]: ramps up and moves across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we actually capture all of this
information in a more comprehensive way?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really in a function rather than
discrete values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've started modeling these growth
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking these patterns in the data
and converting them into a few variables
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can then use to probe the behavior
and use as traits for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, a very basic function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most biological things start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow kind of like an S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is modeled well by a logistic
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't need to read all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just obligatorily showing you the
equation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that there's just a few
variables that we can use to capture the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably better looked at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is total root length,
B73 Missouri 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the final time point, this is after
about a week of growth, B73 has a more
[SPEAKER_00]: total root length, but it's pretty
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this value is captured by one of the
parameters the carrying capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see that here where the
alpha 1, it's a little bit bigger for B73,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another trait, the inflection
point, which is where the growth rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, you can see it here better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth rate is speeding up for B73.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inflection point would be right in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be somewhere on this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri 17 ramps up a little slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it ramps down a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's captured by this value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slope of the line is captured by these
other two values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially, we're distilling these
growth patterns into variables that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: then use to differentiate the genotypes or
eventually to map genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switching things up a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we can do with very high
resolution data where we can see and know
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole root system course out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where we really want to know how
roots grow and behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is our field of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a foot with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tank where we soak the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our mobile field lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's humane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive it around from field to field,
pile out of the back, and just dig lots
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're looking at here,
instead of measuring this by hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is actually a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a camera inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we take formal portraits of the roots,
and we actually use image analysis methods
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure the roots rather than to
measure them by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this, we use a software called
DIRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DIRT is now on iPlanet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no excuse for anyone not to look at the
roots anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wash them off, take a formal
portrait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of information we can
capture then from these two-dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to skip over this
quickly, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a plant genome project where
we're doing a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the core of it, we're studying the
Illinois high and low protein line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these lines have been bred since 1898
for either high or low seed protein
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this protein is storing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really good at taking up
nitrogen, and these aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the extent that nitrogen uptake
should be conditioned by root
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, we should see the difference
in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for high and low protein,
they may look different to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something different about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DIRT kind of gives us a lot of
information about what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you cross these two things
together, this is just phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in the real line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variation is good if you're trying to
map traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've now used this in a GWAS analysis
to identify candidate or SNPs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: near candidate genes that we think may be
controlling root architecture that has
[SPEAKER_00]: some bearing on nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the work of a postdoc in the
lab, Zhengbin Liu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example on chromosome 10,
where we've now drilled down to a
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate gene that we think is
controlling root architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a number of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traits really don't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is for root system width.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these traits are just capturing
some variation in the root phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really meant to be taken
literally, is my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing you here the sorghum
ortholog identity, because we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: found mutation in an existing library in
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's doing a very similar
thing in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see clear root phenotypes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we're getting close to
identifying genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because we know
almost nothing about the quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that control root architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another part of this project,
and the NSF partially funded, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other half of the money came from valent
biosciences who we're working with on root
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere interactions, mycorrhizal
fungi and a rhizobia and nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an industrial scale x-ray imaging
system, the X5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll find this in factory floors and
automobile and aerospace industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's meant for big, heavy things
that are dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what plants and pots
are as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very talented research scientist,
Keith Duncan, running this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a little schematic of how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing can spin around,
kind of like the optical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also see a lot of mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do very large samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, quickly how it works,
there's a source and a detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sits on something with light
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we shoot x-rays through it,
we get a contrast image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the denser the material, the more it
absorbs the x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that generates our difference and
contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cassava, a pot with cassava root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like much, but there's
more magic that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically collect lots of these as
we spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can develop a
three-dimensional reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a whole litany of these
in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as other features of the system,
after we've spun around, we can actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the mechanics in here,
we can actually move the source and
[SPEAKER_00]: detector up and scan across the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, this comes at a cost of
data and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can do it about four feet and we
can also do what's called a mosaics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a tiling scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can scan across and so we can do very
wide things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about a two by two by four foot
imaging volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the voxel resolution on that would be
about 150 to 200 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice thing about the system is we can
also zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a corn kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in and there's a software
called Subpix, which gives us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more resolution, we can get to about the
five to 10 micron voxel size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very versatile instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a real-life example of this,
this is a corn cob we can scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a kernel that came off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can measure lots of stuff within
this corn cob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you can see this,
but also there's the little maze embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're close to being able to count
the number of leaves, things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: end of sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of information in this that we
then have to extract using computation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to the roots, which is really
why we got the system in the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the hidden half of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a corn plant grown in a sort of
expanded clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking at is just a slice
turned like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the movie goes, you can see the
stem and you can see the crown roots here
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and round.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the movie goes, maybe you can track
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a little while, once they start
to get small, you're probably having a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard time tracking those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really the magic, because what
we have to do is extract these roots back
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where root segmentation is an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So segmentation is just a general term for
teaching computer what's foreground and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's background, which objects of
interest and what's not, so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: then measure your object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Nee is working here on automated
or semi-automated methods for tracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look carefully, there's roots
that are missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things in here that are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, we get a reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of missing roots and
there's some stuff that's not missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not roots, but we're getting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an active area of research in my
group and just in general in the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes segmentation is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, it's quite hard, as Mike showed
some examples of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a lot of applications
for machine learning and AI and this
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example, again, the
collaboration with Valent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't do such a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be looking at these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are definitely not nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the world's biggest nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see them if you look
carefully here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, we're kind of getting
there, but we're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as Mike mentioned, if you have
very talented students in the lab who are
[SPEAKER_00]: studious and focused and methodical,
you can clean these up with manual
[SPEAKER_00]: segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, this looks much more like a
soybean root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we can measure the litany of
univariate traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also now identify the nodules,
count the nodules, how big are the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodules, how are these changing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can now capture that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's the work we're doing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just going to kind of go
through stuff since this is a tech forward
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of meeting just to give you some
examples of what we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cassava root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the storage roots and the fine
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not just the external morphology,
also the internal morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually is a little slice of the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to show you that there's a lot
of information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, these are roots that are
about to emerge through the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vascular tissue, things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we can possibly use this in
disease progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, to study cassava brown streak
virus as it starts to develop inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of an ongoing side project
in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is not, we can't,
it's not only that we can see outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, but also inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a maize stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the crown roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one emerges with each leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually see inside the vascular
connections between root and across the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves here in the maize plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's nothing quantitative
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This now requires some person or people to
come in and actually extract features from
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the information is certainly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so x-rays can do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that's a little bit
easier to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a developing tassel in a maize
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about flowering time and
environmental effects that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, we often think about it,
well, when the tassel pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, the primordia, right,
when it's only even smaller than this,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few cells big, is more like the V4,
V5 stage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inside the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been growing there for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be that the relevant time point
when we want to understand the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: is way back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see just from this,
I can predict how many leaves there are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be on the plant before the tassel
emerges, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of an obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably count that by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an example of what it looks
like a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can see the individual florets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure those traits, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example just for mutant
analysis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be an architecture that's
kind of hard to capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how would you measure it by hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Blake wasn't sure about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can capture it inside of the stem
as it's developing and, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: use computation to measure how that's
different from, like, a wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example in cetaria
inflorescence of just... So here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you an idea of some of the
stuff we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to Ruth before I run out of
time completely, one thing that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is trying to extract more
information out of the three-dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you about DERP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really 2D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to extract information
from something we've flattened down into
[SPEAKER_00]: 2D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can scan these in about two or three
minutes, depending on how big it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: what resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing this by the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, if I want to quantify the
differences between these two,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use DERP, but I can also use
three-dimensional data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the three-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complex, and we're working with
some topologists and computer graphics
[SPEAKER_00]: people to clean these up, because there's
actually a lot of loops and noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, we can capture a lot of
information from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't go through this experiment,
but just to say that we basically took the
[SPEAKER_00]: NAMM founders, which sort of encompassed
May's genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted these out in our field in
Columbia, Missouri last year, and we dug
[SPEAKER_00]: every week the roots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a time series, sort of a manual
time series.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a subset of these, at weeks four,
seven, and tasseling, we also scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about 250 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing you 250, only three that
we've analyzed so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at tasseling, this is a principal
component analysis just to show you the 2D
[SPEAKER_00]: DERP traits, all the things we can measure
with that 2D software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Principal component, one does a pretty
good job of separating Kentucky 21,
[SPEAKER_00]: these dots, from B73 and Missouri 17,
but it can't really separate B73 and
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take the x-ray data into account,
all of a sudden, we can now cluster B73,
[SPEAKER_00]: KY21, and Missouri 17 much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's because the information
content's higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing us to separate these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discriminatory power is really what
matters to us most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we really want to, we can go back
and look at the trait loadings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that solidity, for example,
is driving this, and we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify each of the individual univariate
traits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get back to the biological
insight if we want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what matters is discriminatory
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these individual traits don't
mean that much to me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the ability to separate,
and I think that will increase our ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the final bit of time, there's a
section I won't get to, but just going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to this pet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a really interesting
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're looking at carbon moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feed this plant radioactive
carbon-11.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short-lived radioisotope,
very energetic, and it's just fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it in, does photosynthesis,
and starts moving it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an imaging artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at real time at the
carbon moving down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this is so interesting is
because now we're actually looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at what's happening inside
the plant that's driving growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're able to overlay that that's
multimodal imaging with what's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: with the morphology of the plant and how
it's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ty's plant pet system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can look at not only carbon
allocation and plant growth decisions over
[SPEAKER_00]: time as a function of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, there's no carbon going to
the roots, and later we see that develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three maize plants, or subjects
as they're called at the med school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also look at this dynamically in
real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about two and a half hour
window with carbon-11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention Margaret Frank,
who's about to start a faculty position
[SPEAKER_00]: here, has done a lot of work with
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of other radioisotopes you
can use as trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carbon, just a really easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant takes it up, and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have much more time,
but here's a quick example, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: of some biological insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the optical gel system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very young plant where only one
leaf has emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see there's no carbon here
in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it in the shoot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different bedtimes where the
shoot's not being shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only carbon going to a root at this
stage is this crown root here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a shoot-derived root,
and you can see a little spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, when the next leaf emerged,
all of a sudden the dam broke,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plumbing changed, the seed ceases to
be the source of energy for the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now the roots are growing,
being fed from the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an interesting biological
insight I think we can capture with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been hard to do otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ultimately, we're using optical
methods, but now that we have the X-ray,
[SPEAKER_00]: X-ray CT, or X-ray PET, PET CT is actually
where we're moving next, but the optical
[SPEAKER_00]: methods allow us to overlay these two and
actually ask for a given amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: at a root tip, how much did that root grow
later?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something we're modeling,
and we can see changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the jar, we have to use is
kind of small, so when the roots hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the jar, we can actually see a
difference in the relationship of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: to carbon allocated, so actual plant
environment interactions in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted, for example, to query the
transcriptome or the metabolome when two
[SPEAKER_00]: roots interact, if we wait till the roots
have already grown, we've missed the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dynamic event that triggered the
growth and was driving it happened before,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we want to capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't have time to explain a
mathematical technique that we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly, but I'll show you some cool
grape rachises so we can use this
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical method to capture
comprehensive phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the USDA collection,
so Jason Wanda, who's USDA and also here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This represents grape genetic diversity,
and just to show you with this
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical method, we can actually
discriminate different grape rachis
[SPEAKER_00]: architectures very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to use this now for root and
shoot whole plant architectures,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can read.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a preprint here in bioarchives,
work we've done in tomato, also a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice essay in American Journal of Botany
if you want to know more about
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical approaches to, once we have
the data, to actually capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: information in a comprehensive rather than
ad hoc and discrete way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my group at the Dan Forest Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several funders, including the NSF,
USDA, and Valent Biosciences, and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's time, I'm happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I skipped over that slide, but the
Plant Genome Project, we're explicitly
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that, and we're not finished yet,
but instead of correlating a trait we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get from a gel, which is very high
resolution, and what we can get out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, which is sort of low resolution,
we're just comparing at the genetic level,
[SPEAKER_00]: so do we find SNPs or QTL in common from
gel from the field, and not only are we
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the shovelomics or the superficial
roots, but actually many risotron imaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what Andrew Leakey's doing,
so are there any genetic signals in
[SPEAKER_00]: common, which I think is much more solid
ground than traits, which vary depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on how you measure them, for example,
so thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
