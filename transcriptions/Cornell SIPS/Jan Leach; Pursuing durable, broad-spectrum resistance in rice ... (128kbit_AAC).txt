[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to see old friends and
colleagues that I'm working with now
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating and also to be in a place
with snow coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I came from nine inches and now
I brought it with me so you might get nine
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a pleasure to be here and I
obviously didn't do the math very well
[SPEAKER_00]: when I accepted the International Plant
Popology Society presidency because I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be president in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm president now but it'll be 2023 when
the meeting is and obviously I'm not that
[SPEAKER_00]: young anymore so I don't do math very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I'd like to, I'm going to talk
to you about something that I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't often talked about so a lot of
people aren't aware that we're working in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area but it stems from the fact that
we're very interested in, I have been for
[SPEAKER_00]: my whole career interested in,
so I started my career at Kansas State and
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, for those of you who are young,
it's a little bit different because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: went into Kansas they said that I could
work on any system I wanted to as a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathologist, understanding that as a
plant-microbe interaction person we were
[SPEAKER_00]: called disease physiologists at the time
that we would maybe choose model systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had worked in tobacco and
allstonia, selenica, serum for my PhD and
[SPEAKER_00]: then verticillium and hops for my postdoc
and I thought well I really want to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in, what a choice to have, to get to
choose what you want to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to work on an important crop and
I wanted to work on important diseases of
[SPEAKER_00]: an important crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cast around and asked questions,
called my major professor Luis Siqueira
[SPEAKER_00]: and said what would you do if you had it
to do over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I'd work on zygotoka in banana or
I'd work in xanthomonas erysia in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about the time I started in
xanthomonas erysia in rice, they had
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered race specificity, so the idea
that there might be single dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that rice was a diploid so it would
be a tractable system relative to wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the state I was in, Kansas had a
lot of wheat, and that the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthomonas erysia rice, that causes
bacterial blight, would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically tractable, back then it
wasn't, but it probably would be at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point in evolution of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started working in this really
important disease, which is still the
[SPEAKER_00]: major disease in rice, although
xanthomonas erysia, as you'll see,
[SPEAKER_00]: is emerging as an important disease of
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea, my interest was could I apply
my microbiology and my plant physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, we were called, skills from my
PhD to solving this intractable problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we haven't done that yet,
but there are still jobs out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the issue really is that this
disease is fairly well controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: single gene resistance, and the single
dominant genes are sort of the mainstay
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, as you well know,
in plant biology, I don't need to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people this, that you plant out sources of
resistance, they're functional for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years, then you detect virulence in the
pathogen population, the pathogen changes
[SPEAKER_00]: to overcome that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a continuous job, we have to
keep identifying new resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In rice, it can take up to 10 to 15 years
to find and intergress a new disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're breaking down, as can occur
within five or less years, it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: a tractable system, we need to come up
with other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spent a large part of my career
trying to figure out what I call the holy
[SPEAKER_00]: grail, and many other people call it this
too, which is how can we identify disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance that is not only long lasting,
but ideally effective against multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, either multiple races of the
same pathogen, or multiple pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: like different bacterial diseases,
or bacteria and fungi, or different fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the holy grail is a good
example, because by definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: it not only provides happiness and eternal
youth, which of course we'd all love,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also provides food in infinite
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today the story I'm gonna tell you is a
story about identifying resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of novel populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna tell you the story that Anna
Bosa, her PhD work, where she was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistance in rice that is effective
against both two bacteria and bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, which we'll talk about in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broad spectrum resistance, and
specifically targeting Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because both of these
diseases are emerging as really important
[SPEAKER_00]: in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but there's no single
gene resistance for bacterial leaf streak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're moving rice in from
China, into Africa, and those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: rice are susceptible to the African
strains of these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're having a big problem with
the disease in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna move into a second
story, because it uses the same magic
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the power of this magic
population by a postdoc in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alejandro Huerta, and Emily DeLorean,
who was a master's student in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two diseases that will be featured
today are caused by Xanthomonas arizicula,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is bacterial leaf streak of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really an interesting disease
because, and the difference between these
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intercellular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enters the plant through the stomates,
and it moves in the plant in intercellular
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Xanthomonas arizi arizi,
very closely related genetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a vascular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enters the plants either through wounds
or the hydathode water pores, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: located on the edges of the leaf,
and it causes a blight-like symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two very similar pathogens,
but two very different lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding resistance that's effective
against both could be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge, one might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, bacterial leaf
streak is emerging as a major problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of Asia and in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually thought that it used to be
observed only on one side of the Yangtze
[SPEAKER_00]: River in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's observed on both sides of the
Yangtze River, and they're thinking a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is because of climate variation and
impacts of weather on the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we don't have single
dominant resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only single dominant resistance genes
that we have to this pathogen are one that
[SPEAKER_00]: we identified from maize, years ago,
which is when introduced into rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: controls the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, they usually use
quantitative trait type loci, or
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative trait governed resistance to
control this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are limited resistance sources
for it, not only in Asia, but also in
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bacterial blight, as I mentioned,
is a vascular pathogens controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: single genes, but there are few sources of
resistance that have been identified that
[SPEAKER_00]: are effective against the African isolates
of this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me introduce you to the population
that we used to identify sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my colleagues at the International Rice
Research Institute, a few years back,
[SPEAKER_00]: developed what are called rice magic
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these populations are multi-parent
advanced generation populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks may have worked with them,
and there are now magic populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only in rice, but also in wheat and
also Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This population has eight parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine the genetics that
you're scrambling when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-crossing eight parents, and we'll
talk about how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to notice, this is the
population, there are 2,000 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant it out at Erie, where they're
propagating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to notice how beautifully even
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because in this particular case,
eight of the parents that were selected
[SPEAKER_00]: are elite varieties, but they have
different traits of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means, and importantly what
that means, is that anything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: identify in this population is very close,
it's like a pre-breeding material,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very close to what the breeders can
use to intergress into other elite
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a lot of genetic drag from
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other reason it's nice is because
not only did they select those eight
[SPEAKER_00]: parents for useful traits like disease
resistance, drought tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: salt tolerance, phosphorus utilization,
but the population is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 21,000 magic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you map in that population,
you're almost getting down to the genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring, as I mentioned,
can be integrated directly into breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
this because I'm not the person that
[SPEAKER_00]: developed it, and it's a pretty
complicated process and long-term process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you take the eight parents and you do
a series of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you've crossed at least three
times to develop this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you've finished crossing,
you start selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you self, in our case,
we use the S8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get rid of any other extraneous
information, but you have really a single,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a true line once you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you have 21,000 isogenic
lines once you get down to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they breed true because rice is a
selfing population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really powerful, but really
they hadn't explored the utility of it for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a little bit of work on that,
but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Anna came into my lab,
we wanted to ask the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: could we use this magic lines,
the series of magic lines to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of disease resistance that are
novel and that are effective against both
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthomonas arizi arizi, the bacterial
blight pathogen, and xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: arizicula, the bacterial leaf streak
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focused on the African strains
because we had this issue of the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: being prevalent in Africa, but no sources
of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step was to genotype the
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was done by genotyping by
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 14,000 SNPs that we were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the entire suite of SNPs,
but 14,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we screened a subset of the S8
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really fixed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did about 330 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the importance of that is that it's
not a huge population to screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll see it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could identify sources of resistance
in a very small population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We phenotyped with the two diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular disease, we use a scissor
clip to introduce it into the vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intercellular pathogen, we infiltrate
into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the experiment was done with 20
different, very diverse xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: arizicula and arizi strains, 10e.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we not only did this in the
greenhouse, replicated in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, but we also, with our
colleagues in Africa, screened in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously, if you're looking for
resistance, it has to be effective in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of that data is taken and
integrated and analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we're using a huge population
with multiple parents, you can do GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis or GWAS genome-wide association
analysis, as well as interval mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna give you the whole
experimental process that Anna used to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the steps because I wanna move into the
second set of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an example of one set of
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the indica was
segregating for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see typically that you have
transgressive segregation, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that are more susceptible than the
eight parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in often cases, we have lines that are
more susceptible or more resistant than
[SPEAKER_00]: the most resistant parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just two of the different
pathogens that were used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation, one arizi and one arizicula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the population, oh,
I forgot to tell you a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other good thing about the magic,
because you're scrambling the genomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create new novel resistances
because you get recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can uncover resistances that you
might not have seen in a particular parent
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its genetic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a population like this,
you have many obvious opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: creating new sources of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Anna in the GWAS studies was able to
identify sources of resistance to not only
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthomonas arizi arizi bacterial blight,
as you can see from this, but also when
[SPEAKER_00]: she did identify those sources of
resistance, what was wonderful was this
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't always happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in general true, but not always
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can confirm what we identified in GWAS
by the interval mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't always happen, but that's a
good indicator that what we're seeing is
[SPEAKER_00]: really real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the most important piece of
information is that we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: recapitulate what we saw in the greenhouse
in the field in Mali.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, what she ended up with was
a map and that map includes resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she identified 14 different QTL that
were effective to multiple xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: arizi strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both xanthomonas arizi and arizicula,
she got 11 broad spectrum resistances that
[SPEAKER_00]: those regions conferred resistance to both
pathogens with very different lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she was able to identify three
pathovar specific QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is great, but what's most
interesting is this one here on chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: four, because the stars indicate and the
bars indicate different isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the one on chromosome
four hit a lot of isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a source of resistance that we
had never observed in any other
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about it is that
when we look at that region, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can map this with both GWAS and
interval mapping, we can actually get down
[SPEAKER_00]: to what SNPs are important for resistance
and which SNPs are important for
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility relative to the different
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps us narrow into the region
with the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was effective against many of the
isolates that we had screened it with from
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, in the field and in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a major contribution in that particular
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this part, using the magic
population, which we didn't know if we
[SPEAKER_00]: were gonna be able to see sources of
resistance to either of the pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there were a few single dominant
resistance genes in the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw them, but we were able to pull out
11 different genes that were effective
[SPEAKER_00]: against both pathogens, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one on chromosome four is one
that we're focused on still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was confirmed in both the
greenhouse and the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is important because now that
we have these lines with, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: this chromosome four QTL or this region of
resistance, we can begin to integrate this
[SPEAKER_00]: into varieties that are useful in both
Africa and in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, as a backdrop, we now knew
that this population was manageable and we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to screen all 2100 lines in
order to identify something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, okay, let's start to see if we
can begin to ask questions with that
[SPEAKER_00]: population that we've been interested in
for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Alejandra led this project with the
help of Ana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna point out mapping with eight
parents that are scrambled up is not
[SPEAKER_00]: trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the analytical programs to do the GWAS
and interval mapping were just being
[SPEAKER_00]: developed as Ana was doing this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was on the phone with this
molecular mapper, the bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_00]: person who originally was in the
Philippines, then was in Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now is at a company in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ana was continually, and they were
wonderful at working with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she became a really valuable resource
for the rest of the work in the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: learned a lot more than she expected to
about these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question was, can we use this
population to identify rice varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: target specific effectors in pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would we wanna do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that of interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you, especially in this
department where Adam Bogdanov is,
[SPEAKER_00]: know that TAL effectors are the dominant
effector families in Xanthomonids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Xanthomonas erysia and
Xanthomonas erysia erysia and Xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: erysia erysicola have multiple copies of
TAL effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are transcription activator-like
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the major virulence factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the major effectors for these
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have other effectors, but these are
the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effectors are produced in the
bacteria, pumped into the plant cell using
[SPEAKER_00]: a type three secretion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in the plant cell, they're mobilized
into the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind to the promoters of genes in the
plant, and they activate the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: of those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Xanthomonas erysii strains that we
work with have multiple copies of the TAL
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have up to 20 or more copies of
these effector genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they bind to these sequences in
the plant and activate their expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are several important factors
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of the TAL effectors function,
and not all of them function equally in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of years ago, Gianfabai,
when he was in the lab, showed that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: knock out one gene, AverXA7, you reduce
virulence of the pathogen significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, if you knock that gene
out, it's a major effect TAL effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to see the effect of other TAL
effectors, we had to work with that mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: and knock out other genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that there's no additional
effect when he knocked out AverXA10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continued to work with that particular
set of isolates, and we also did field
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, Nali Vera-Cruz, when she was in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed that at the field level,
a number of years back, back in 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you lose AverXA7 function in the
field, not only do you lose the effector
[SPEAKER_00]: function, the avirulence function,
but you also lose the fitness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, or the aggressiveness and
reduced fitness in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't persist in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be a very, very,
very important fitness factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that work, we at that time
proposed a hypothesis that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the durability of a resistance
gene based on its contribution to pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AverXA7 is a very important effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, if a resistance gene
targets that, that resistance gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be more effective and
durable in the field than one that targets
[SPEAKER_00]: AverXA10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Nali showed that in field
experiments and in greenhouse experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you lose AverXA7 function in the
field, if there's mutation in the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you lose the pathogen doesn't
persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a very effective resistance
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, there are other
effectors in xanthomonas arizi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had looked at a number of these
other effectors doing similar studies like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them stood out because it was
called TAL7b.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a TAL effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in the genomes of many,
many different xanthomonas arizi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one has only an incremental or a
minor contribution to virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you knock it out as well as AverXA7,
you get an incremental decrease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our question was, also this one is
found in almost all the sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthomonas arizi genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's present everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a minor contribution to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we identify sources of resistance to
TAL7b, could that be added to our gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool for resistance to help stabilize and
make the resistance more durable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since so many bacteria have it,
even if it's only contributing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit to virulence, is it contributing more
to other things like fitness in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alejandra and her colleagues set up an
experiment similar to what Ana had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the genotype lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We phenotyped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we subcloned and confirmed
first that we had TAL7b.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it into a strain where we were
over-expressing it purposefully because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a minor effect and we're screening a
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have a pretty hefty gene
product in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then went through the mapping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, the magic lines segregate
for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, you can see that they
segregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have transgressive segregation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing higher levels of
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you in a minute
about the function of TAL effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the population has lines that are more
susceptible than the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also implies, importantly,
that you can map for susceptibility if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to understand virulence in a
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting point to this is
that we were able to identify resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to PXO99 with the empty vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the control strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lines that are more resistant
than the parent, as well as lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more resistant to the PXO99, the strain
with the TAL7b effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly for us to move forward,
the magic population contains lines with
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and susceptibility to TAL7b.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not surprising that TAL7b showed
the virulence function, that it had lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that it caused more disease because we
knew it was a virulence factor before we
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we confirmed that in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line on this one,
in the GWAS analysis, we saw resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: ARISE PXO99 with the empty vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the population shows resistance to the
strain that we were using to screen with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we know that this is the XA5
locus, which Susan LeCouche worked with a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those, you can see those same
loci were identified when we put the TAL7b
[SPEAKER_00]: into the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we found that there was
resistance that was unique to the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying TAL7b.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we identified two loci that conferred
resistance to TAL7b specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was in the strain that had 99,
the strain PXO99.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also importantly for us, all these QTL
or these regions were confirmed by
[SPEAKER_00]: interval mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's so interesting about TAL
effectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is TAL7b potentially acting in
this line?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we predict something about how
this might be, how this resistance might
[SPEAKER_00]: be functioning by understanding something
about TAL7b?
[SPEAKER_00]: So TAL7b, TAL effectors in general are
known to interact with plants in generally
[SPEAKER_00]: in three different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, they bind to the promoter of
what is called a death gene, a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance gene type function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they activate expression of that gene
and you get cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the XA10, AVR XA10 interaction is an
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of how TAL effectors
interact with plant genes is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to the promoter of the susceptibility
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they bind, they activate
expression of that susceptibility gene and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get increased disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis is, for example,
that these sweet genes might be
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering, helping to deliver sugar out
to feed the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other hypothesis or other mechanism
that's been demonstrated is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, instead of activation of a death
gene, you have mutations or changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter or nearby the promoter that don't
allow the TAL effector to bind and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get activation of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, you have resistance by loss
of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a hypersensitive type of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the lack of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ask the question, how is the
resistance to TAL7G functioning in these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we develop a hypothesis and predict
what's happening by looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at a number of the magic
lines as well as a control line,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, this is the empty vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the overexpressed TAL7G.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we have an enhanced
susceptibility or enhanced virulence,
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced disease, longer lesions in these
lines that were not showing resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is most of the population,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would suggest that the TAL7B is
activating a susceptibility gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one hypothesis that we can test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the lines, and it's
consistent with the whole population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the lines where we saw
resistance, especially related to this QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: that we identified on chromosome eight,
that conferred resistance to TAL7B,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that there's no enhanced virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: TAL7B is not increasing the virulence of
99, as it did on the other lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we would predict or we
would hypothesize that we have either a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the promoter region or nearby
the promoter region that is where the TALB
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot enhance virulence because it's not
activating the susceptibility gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lines that have the QTL8 in them
are consistent with a loss of
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the mechanism for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the beauty of the TAL-effector world
is that you can predict what the target is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant because the TAL-effector code
has been broken by Adam and other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know how to predict what TAL7B
should bind to based on the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, using certain methods several
bioinformatic tools that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed to ask what it binds to,
Alejandra pulled out a set of putative
[SPEAKER_00]: targets that it might be binding to and
activating in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, she hit on a lot of
the genes that you would predict might be
[SPEAKER_00]: true, but she also hit on some other ones
that are known to be involved in defense
[SPEAKER_00]: responses but not necessarily had shown to
be involved in these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are genes that lie within the
QTL that she identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting ones,
for example, is that's not a sweet gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this CERC gene because she sees a snip
in the EBE, the potential effector binding
[SPEAKER_00]: domain that's actually close to the start,
but not in the promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very close to it in that particular
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I've convinced you that magic is
a powerful tool for discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and characterization of novel
TAL-effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screened these 330 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, we were working with
the S8 generation, which means that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had taken the lines and self them eight
times, eight generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually performed the analysis in an
earlier generation, the S4 generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially landed on the same loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is we maybe don't have
to go out eight generations to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and discover the things that we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified novel broad spectrum
resistant sources that target both XOC and
[SPEAKER_00]: XOO in those populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also identified QTL that target a
specific effector, two regions that target
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we propose that the resistance
mechanism, we have a hypothesis that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can now test, is that the resistance
mechanism for one of those is through a
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other important point is that all
of these sources, as a plant breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't necessarily care what the
mechanism is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more interested in getting a
useful and dynamic source of resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: that will stand up in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we can introduce these
effectively into elite varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can begin to ask the question,
do they, in fact, increase the durability
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they broad spectrum at a fixed
rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they increase the field scale in the
elite variety backgrounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I maybe talked a little faster than I
intended, or a little slower, but I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to thank our many collaborators,
especially our colleagues in Mali,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Africa, who did the field screening led
by Valerie Vadier from France,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alejandra and Anna here, and my lab group,
along with Herman, who comes to my lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer to get out of Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of you recognize him,
and also to our many funding sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna was supported by a Batchel Borlaug
Scholarship, and Alejandra by an NSF
[SPEAKER_00]: Scholarship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Alan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you look at transcriptomic changes,
specifically like with the serum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that's what she's doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the next step, is to test
which of those genes is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I neglected to say,
I'm not surprised that we have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking about quantitative
traits, and we've got two different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tally factors could target multiple
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they probably do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not at all surprised about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would bet that we will see more
of that as we move through looking at each
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she's doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got the lines growing and getting
everything out to test the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be really exciting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, it was inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the pots, and they inoculated the
pots from the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same group of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same group of strains with a few
exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't put any Philippine strains in
Mali.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could only put the Malian strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only had two Asian isolation
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in our study anyway, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that the sequence or the
locus was effective against both strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but was against all individuals of both
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one locus on chromosome 4 was
effective at a statistic level against
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all, almost all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 18 or so out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the 2018 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the statistics, it probably
showed some level of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're measuring lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other loci were against a few strains
of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're more interested in
that one on chromosome 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say about the ones
that are effective against a few strains
[SPEAKER_00]: of Arizine, a few strains of Arizicla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the tally factor complements in
Arizine and Arizicla are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't expect that to be a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect it to be something else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Janet, I was curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your laboratory phenotyping, you were
seeing resistance phenotype with lesion
[SPEAKER_03]: lengths, a third less, a half plus,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the field, is that resistance magnified
much more in a field setting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it a partial kind of resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a partial resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it compares.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I've forgotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it, would it be effective in the
field if it was just a partial?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't remember the numbers
now, but I know that it was clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant, more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it compared
proportionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back and look at that
data.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do both with magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we use the same population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just two different mapping strategies
with two different premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GWAS is a population, you're looking at
a sort of looking for a population,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas interval mapping is, again,
this is where I'm the weakest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the plant geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in interval mapping, you're looking
for association of a trait with a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular region of the genome,
rather than comparing across the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the nice things about
this, because we can do both types of
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping, because it's really a population,
because you have eight genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: scrambled, so you can do both types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't use the standard mapping
tools that are developed for a bi-parental
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we had to work with the folks
that were developing the tools for the
[SPEAKER_00]: eight-parent populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say this is an indica population,
so those of you who know rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a japonica magic population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's what's called a global
population, which is they took the eight
[SPEAKER_00]: from the japonica and the eight from the
indica and crossed them, so 16 parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a lot of genetic problems
when you put japonica and indica together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some problems with that
population, but it's still useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of things, identifying these
kinds of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't matter if you're
missing parts of the chromosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't recombine, you don't really care if
you identify something useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there attempts to create artificial
gene sequences that would increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: effectiveness of some of the genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, interesting you should ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked if there are attempts to
create artificial gene sequences that
[SPEAKER_00]: would increase the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you notice, you may or may not have
noticed, I took promoterome out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: title because I had another part that I
was going to present that would have
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the length of the talk
considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about the activation of
defense responses downstream of these
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's common, whether it be single-gene
resistance governed versus QTL governed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of commonality of what's
induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the defense response genes
downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a graduate student in my lab,
Brad, identified conserved structural
[SPEAKER_00]: regions in the promoters of the genes that
have cis elements that are conserved in
[SPEAKER_00]: defense response genes, several of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if the genes are co-expressed,
they often have these elements in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hypothesis is that we can use
those pieces of information either to edit
[SPEAKER_00]: genes so that they're better soldiers,
they're better responders to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance genes, or we can breed
genome-wide for more effective defense
[SPEAKER_00]: responses that are governed by these
upstream genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I took it out because it would
have taken a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the chromosome for QTL,
does that extend to like 90%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if Anna hadn't had to graduate and
leave the lab, that would have been the
[SPEAKER_00]: next steps, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a start on cloning the target
genes there because we've also got target
[SPEAKER_00]: genes there that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing was to screen for
magnoporthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just come back from China on
Saturday, and I've arranged with some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send it to them and have them
screen because we don't have the expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: for magnoporthy in the lab anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rhizoctonia, I'm really interested
because we don't have single-gene
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance for rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really interested in whether,
because it might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any blast-resistance loci that
are colloquialized with that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of the genome from other studies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering why there are new loci
popping out that the industry has yet to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because those are new gene pools
that are in the eight params?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it could be that we've
created a new gene through recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that we've uncovered resistances that
didn't show up in the parents because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got them into new parent
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stretch across a half an arm of
the chromosome through the old mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very likely are regions that
were identified for blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was novel for a rhizae and a
rhizocle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some single genes on chromosome
4, but not underneath that QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's novel in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the single-gene resistances to
bacterial blight are not NBLRRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: To blast, there are a lot of NBLRRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That region does have NBLRRs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that we could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we will also do,
if I survive long enough to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be to sequence those regions to see
and compare them across the different
[SPEAKER_00]: lines to see what they actually have
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the SNP profiles clearly show that
they're unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you would have to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a live one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll save most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is about mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it can be a little challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering what the genetic
resources are for the parents you have
[SPEAKER_01]: available and how large structural
variation at this region could impact your
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you end up mapping back to NBLRR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IR64.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the SNP genotypes for the parents
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we can predict which parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some of those QTL,
we can predict which parent they came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not trivial when you have eight
parents to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I can just quickly back up to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Ana's paper, the full version
of this is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can predict based on the haplotypic
block which parent they came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that region came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's identical to that
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it could have collected some small
recombination that we don't measure with
[SPEAKER_00]: maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know by the block approximately
which region is contributing from which
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Ana's paper, and I think
it's in the supplemental information,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's made much more clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as a token of our gratitude,
we are excellent and obviously full of
[SPEAKER_02]: proposals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
