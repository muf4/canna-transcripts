[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Cornell has become like my
second home base, aside from IITA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to thank the organizers
of this meeting for giving me the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to come and share some of the
work that we are doing in cassava breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: in IITA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first spring seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also an honor to be like the first
presenter for this session.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my presentation, whatever I'll talk
about is on behalf of a large team of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work is not my own self, but I'm part
of a large team of groups, especially my
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues at the International Institute
of Tropical Agriculture, my colleagues at
[SPEAKER_01]: the National Breeding Program,
in Nigeria, NRCRI, and the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Program in Uganda, NACRI, Cornell team,
John Luke's lab, Lucas Muller's lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course the great help that we
receive from Ed Buckler's lab in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: SNP genotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also are collaborating with the
educational institutions in Africa for
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity development.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the colleges in Uganda and in
Ghana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to repeat again, the research
areas that I've been focusing on are part
[SPEAKER_01]: of a few different projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is the next gen cassava
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list of all the partners that we
work with there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also working on the CGAR research
program on roots, tubers, and bananas,
[SPEAKER_01]: where crops like cassava, yam,
plantain, sweet potato groups are
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborating very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cassava, it's seed in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on a harvest plus project on
biofortification of cassava for
[SPEAKER_01]: pro-vitamin A content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a brief background about my
institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of IIT campus in Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful, big, campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those people who have visited there,
I'm sure they must have fallen in love
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to come, I'm giving you an
open invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: IIT was established 50 years ago exactly
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're governed by a board of trustees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a lot of partners to enhance
crop quality, productivity, to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: produce and consumer risks, and to
generate wealth from agriculture by value
[SPEAKER_01]: addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the CGAR centers,
and this is my lab where I'm based.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hubs besides where we are based in
Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have hubs in East Africa,
in Tanzania, in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hubs in West Africa, in Southern
Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the mended crops that we
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work on, for example, my crop is
cassava, but of course we work on maize,
[SPEAKER_01]: banana, plantain, cowpea, soybean,
and yams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know more about these other
crops, you can see me after the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the major traits that we focus on in
terms of cassava improvement, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: serious problems in virus diseases,
particularly cassava mosaic, cassava brown
[SPEAKER_01]: streak viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of problems with pests,
cassava mealybug and green mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to work on improvement of
yield and yield components, and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenges that the crop faces is,
as usual, associated with clonally
[SPEAKER_01]: propagated species that are highly
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, it's not easy to make
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of genetic load,
as we have just found out from the work of
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed's group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very low multiplication rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you come from a seedling,
you want to have multi-locational trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to spend a few years multiplying
your planting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also resource intensive in terms
of phenotyping, because you require large
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing between plants to establish a
plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, the cassava researchers in
Africa, and my institution in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: together with the national programs,
we have achieved a remarkable success
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have released more than 40
improved varieties across the continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a strong collaboration with our
national programs in this process,
[SPEAKER_01]: because ITA does not release anything on
its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share germplasm resources, so all our
breeding lines are available to anyone who
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done biological control work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in the 1970s, there was a
serious mealybug outbreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cassava green mite outbreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And researchers from our institute were
able to introduce a biological control
[SPEAKER_01]: species from other continents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of solved that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a big cassava mosaic
disease pandemic that occurred in East
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that almost threatened to wipe out the
production of this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our institution was also key in terms
of finding solutions to that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my current research focus, of course,
with the advances in the genomics era,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are really trying to apply them in many
different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we want to understand the
organization of our gene pool in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, population structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are implementing genomic selection and
the next gen project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the data that's coming from
genotyping and phenotyping, we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to go after the major genes that are
controlling the various traits that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, I'll focus on cassava
mosaic dry matter and carotenoid content,
[SPEAKER_01]: because these two traits, they have an
interesting story behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the cassava mosaic disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto the first topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said earlier, ITA holds a large
collection of breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have improved varieties that have been
cloned since the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a large collection of local
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are land races that have been
assembled by breeders as the base
[SPEAKER_01]: population for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the regional breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we collected accessions from them to
genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have accessions representing
diversity from Latin America so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can see where our African gene pool is
fitting in the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the pairways, identity by
state distances, we kind of had a first
[SPEAKER_01]: look of the relationship between the gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here that we have wild
relatives of cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: As expected, they pull away from the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the ITA genetic gain or
improved varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: They form this group here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that most of our
improved varieties, they derive from some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of wild cultivated hybridizations to
introduce quantitative resistance against
[SPEAKER_01]: those major pests and viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the Latin American
accessions down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are very closely related with
land races that have been improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that we can really trace
back which accessions in our germplasm are
[SPEAKER_01]: very closely related to the founders that
came from that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second thing that we wanted to do
is we have a lot of land races that we
[SPEAKER_01]: collect from farmers fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know how they're related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are super yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we try to understand their pedigrees
so that if we want, we can reconstruct
[SPEAKER_01]: them through improvement and more crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the ability to generate genome-wide
sleep data gave us an opportunity that
[SPEAKER_01]: made us be able to calculate identity by
descents and pairwise kinships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, this graph here shows
the first degree relatives, like parent,
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring, or full-sips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blue colors are the land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red ones are the improved varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see which are the major hubs
or the clones that have been used many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many, many times to produce the germplasm
that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with this, I worked very closely
with Manning Wolf to do this analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
our genomic selection breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite an important aspect of my
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for the last four
years, of course, with all the partners
[SPEAKER_01]: that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there they are again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, the breeding cycle of cassava
takes several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start with the seedlings,
up to 100,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plant them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We select a clone, 500 to 3,000 clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go through preliminary yield trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it's single replications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go to advanced yield trial,
multi-locational yield trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we go in this direction,
we are reducing the number of genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are increasing the plot sizes and the
amount of replication and locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before you can confirm a clone has
a good potential to put it back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing block, you have to go through
this kind of path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so can we reduce this by
short-circuiting the breeding pipeline and
[SPEAKER_01]: go from seed to cross, so seed to seed on
an annual basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were kind of ambitious to try that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course, we have to do some
phenotyping to recalibrate our prediction
[SPEAKER_01]: models.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what we did for the last
four or five years is to go from seed to
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the process how it starts is like June
is our rainy season start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plant our crossing block.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We transplant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going on right now in Ibadan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We extract DNA, genotype, and generate the
breeding values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cycle goes back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since we started, we have cycle
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our cycle one are in the uniform yield
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we will have varieties that
we can release to the farmers and show
[SPEAKER_01]: that these are the products of genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictorial representation again of how we
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the seed bed that we germinate,
transplantation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we have good irrigation
facility that helps us to plant in the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cross-validation accuracies,
it depends on the trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we have traits that have
high cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those traits usually have higher
repeatability in phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is the resistance to cassava
mosaic disease, carotenoid content,
[SPEAKER_01]: starch or dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our yield and yield component is slightly
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will see that even despite that,
we are able to make progress in many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year, we had an opportunity to
test out the three cycles that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cycle zero, the founders, cycle one,
and cycle two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant them all out in a replicated trial
in two environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And randomize and evaluate the
performances relative to the traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were selecting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, for cassava mosaic
disease, it's going negative, meaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: our population is becoming more resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're enriching the resistance alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: For dry matter content, there is an
increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fresh yield, you can see there's a
trend from C0 to 1 to 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the yield components like root
number and root weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carotenoids, we are not selecting for this
trait in this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually breeding for white roots
for starch production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a different population for
yellow trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were selecting for that,
I'm sure the trend would be even much
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we did is that we have
populations like genomic selection cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: two that were not part of the training
population that made the GEBVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the GEBVs from all the data up
to 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took the phenotype of 2015,
2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we correlated them for the various
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that for CMD, it's high,
0.76.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry matter, 0.55.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carotenoids, it's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for fresh yield, surprisingly,
it's 0.44.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's higher even than what we got from the
cross validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to switch gears to the
research that the other area that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on, which is genome-wide
association mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to talk about this trait of
dry matter and carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dry matter is what the farmers are
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cassava is 70% on average water when you
have to harvest the fresh fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the higher the dry matter content you
have, the more carbohydrates that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get from your harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have a huge variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in our case, we have
clones that are as low as 8% and as high
[SPEAKER_01]: as almost 50% dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other trait is pro-vitamin A content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the clones that we farmers are
growing are white roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Nigeria, they have to add palm oil
to make it appear yellow because it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: aesthetically attractive and it fetches a
premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine if you can give farmers
varieties that are yellow naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: they also provide micronutrients that are
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these two traits, they're negatively
correlated, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we have the intensity of the
root color in terms of yellowness and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see clearly there's an inverse
relationship between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our first attempt in understanding or
mapping the gene or the QTL for this was
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bi-parental population that we had,
which segregated, among other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: for carotenoid content, like it was yellow
and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a PST1 GBS library prepared from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got 770 SNP markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a standard QTL analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a major peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: On chromosome 1 for the carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had other peaks for other traits,
like resistance to cassava mosaic disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to zoom in, this is the region
where we had our marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see clearly it explained
almost 100% of the variation for this
[SPEAKER_01]: specific population.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we went to the genome, we found a
gene that is well known in the carotenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had an amino acid change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this amino acid change was previously
confirmed in a different population in
[SPEAKER_01]: Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we say, OK, for a bi-parental cross,
this is what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we increase our germplasm to the
breeding collection, genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype, and see what we can recover,
if there are additional alleles?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, we went to our ITA
genetic gain population, the 700 clones
[SPEAKER_01]: plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had multi-year data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we genotype again, but this time with
APK1 library.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the distribution of the two
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, roots yellowness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a chromometer, which measures the
intensity of the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the channels, the B channel,
this is the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the white roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the yellow roots from low
carotenoid to high carotenoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the dry matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the population structure basically,
in terms of PCA and the neighbor joining
[SPEAKER_01]: tree, you see that there's some cluster of
yellow accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that they are derived from
the same kind of pedigree or genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did the mixed linear model to
account also for population structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got two major peaks on chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did dry matter, we get exactly
at the same position as the first peak a
[SPEAKER_01]: marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving from basic research to applied
breeding, if we are to give these markers
[SPEAKER_01]: to breeders, what is their selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: How successful will they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of plotted the genotype at
the first locus and at the second locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the distribution of the
carotenoid content, the same for dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these two peaks did not explain all
the variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can see here, the distribution is
much, much wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be other loci that are
interacting with these two guys to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went back to our genomic selection
population, which is the founder parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had selected parents making cyclotron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cycle 1, we selected to make cycle 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we genotype, we phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: In total, we have 5,100 plus accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We repeated the association again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that we have a major peak on
chromosome 1 for dry matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are able to pick additional loci
across the genome for the two traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the area where we're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it pleiotropic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a link effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it physical linkage that is causing
these two traits to be inversely related?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer this question, we say,
if I split the population into white root
[SPEAKER_01]: and yellow root and repeat the analysis,
and if it's pleiotropic, the QTL for dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter should disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see clearly that when you look at
the yellow root samples, the QTL for dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the white root samples,
the QTL for dry matter is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's much broader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom, I have also plotted the
LD, local LD pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see clearly that there's a
huge chunk of chromosome segment that is
[SPEAKER_01]: not recombining.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, there seems to be some
region that has recombined here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the peak is narrower compared to this
guy where the peak is much, much larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my kind of conclusion there was that it
could be physical linkage plays a much
[SPEAKER_01]: more important role than pleiotropy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we scanned all the chromosomes for
this kind of LD pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we clearly see that that section on
chromosome 1 is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have the big one on chromosome 4
and 10 and smaller segments scattered all
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the first HapMap project with
the University of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckley, Dan Rocksell's group,
where we sequenced the wild relatives and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated and tried to look at segments
of wild accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cultivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are found all over the genome,
especially in chromosome 1 and chromosome
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some small bits here you can see on
chromosome 10, exactly where we had those
[SPEAKER_01]: non-recombining segments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, I had an interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, let me take one clone that is
having these two segments, make a
[SPEAKER_01]: self-population out of it, phenotype,
and see what comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trait that I was interested in at
that time was resistance to mosaic
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, cassava mosaic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is why this wild cultivated
hybridizations were implemented to confer
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But surprisingly, we found out that the
roots are segregating for a funny pattern
[SPEAKER_01]: of carotenoid deposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you have right at the middle of
the root in some clones, you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: carotenoid presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: In others, it's completely white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we map this trait, it's coming to
chromosome 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing on chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that major gene that we thought was the
key switch in this place does not play a
[SPEAKER_01]: big role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for dry matter, the major locus is
present on chromosome 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corresponding to this wild haplotype
introgression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, now that we have multiple loci for
carotenoids and for dry matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we can convert those markers to
allele-specific PCR assays to give to the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders for marker-assisted selection,
what can happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that when you have marker
on chromosome 1, the first snip,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the second snip, and then the one on
chromosome 8, various allele combinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see the variability in the trait of
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can basically go forward,
at least with forward breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: For dry matter, the repeatability is not
that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, also, you can see that
there's differences between the different
[SPEAKER_01]: markers at the loci that we have analyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was a breeder, I would go for
these guys here and not select them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't select these guys here at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go to the third trait that
we are interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cassava mosaic disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the longest studied traits in
cassava.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a brief background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two types of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an infected plant looks like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quantitative type of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are wild cassava hybrids that are
growing on the roadside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they show small symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, they survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a cassava has this type, it can produce
a good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have absolutely clean plants,
no symptoms whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been phenotyping our
gene-jamplasm pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the land races and the improved
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, clearly, the improved
clones are more resistant than the land
[SPEAKER_01]: races.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are certain genotypes that are
highly resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are those that are highly
susceptible and those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, you will see a symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow, you won't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the quantitative type of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our first attempt to map this type of
resistance was in a biparental cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a nice peak there on this
chromosome 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, we didn't have reference
genome or chromosome scale assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it was named.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we thought, let's make a
different population from a different
[SPEAKER_01]: source or parent that has different
pedigree and see if something else comes
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still found exactly the same
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of made me start to think
that in the literature, you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: claims that somebody is a certain SSR
marker that is not the original one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that they have uncovered a
new source of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would give it a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say, this is CMD3 or CMD4
and CMD5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these really different sources,
or is it the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in one of our papers, what we did
is we had managed to assemble the
[SPEAKER_01]: scaffolds on this linkage group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the best-linked marker
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original publication for CMD
resistance by Akano et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2002 found this SSR linked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually very close to the
scaffold that we found in our GBS data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second marker is a few centimorgans
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the distance from it is proportional
to the proportion of variance explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you move away, all the markers that
was found and was claimed to be new
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of resistance is basically
something that is on the same chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the Nexion project started,
we assembled large Jumplers from Nigeria
[SPEAKER_01]: National Program, NICRI, Chie Dose's
group, Robert Kauchi's group in Uganda,
[SPEAKER_01]: IITA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we say, let's do a large-scale
scanning of this Jumplers to find out if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something else that we didn't
uncover before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we worked with Martin Wolf in John
Luke's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found still that the major
resistance is like a single locus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some smaller peaks around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the study of CMD does not end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our gene pool, when we did the
GBS-based genotyping, we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify sets of clones that are identical
by markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some accession that we genotype
multiple times in order to determine the
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold of saying two things are same or
different, because you can have technical
[SPEAKER_01]: errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this case, this threshold tells
you that these guys here, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: distance you have, you're basically still
the same clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's reflected here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two guys, they share the same
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, they're exactly the same
genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this on the larger Jumplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll note is that you have a
big group of landraces that are almost 100
[SPEAKER_01]: times replicated in our collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something struck me, because these
landraces, they have different names,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have also different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One set is completely susceptible to
mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we use it as a spreader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a variant of that that is
completely resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we phenotype for CMD, I just drew
a heat map of low means resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: blue, red means susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on different phenotype, you can
clearly tell different clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, you can see consistently that
for cassava mosaic disease at one month
[SPEAKER_01]: and at six months, that there is a group
that is resistant, these guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the group that is susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, let's make a cross between
these two parents and see if we can find
[SPEAKER_01]: out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we cross, we genotype for a single
clonal trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get that it's still CMD2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very intriguing, because this
type of resistance for this disease in
[SPEAKER_01]: cassava is very broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a single dominant gene, but it
doesn't care what kind of subspecies of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Gemini virus that it is encountering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, it appears to be durable,
because for a long time since these
[SPEAKER_01]: landraces were discovered, there's no
incidence or reports of breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we now find out that in the 1930s and
40s, when early breeders encountered the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, the problem of the virus,
they searched for this kind of resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: they could not find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they resorted to crosses with a wild
relative to produce this quantitative type
[SPEAKER_01]: of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a few decades later in the 1980s,
during expeditions to collect gemplasm,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders found accessions that are
absolutely clean in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it appears that it's a new mutation
that has arisen recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is possible that this is where it
arose, because this is the most common
[SPEAKER_01]: clone in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown in West Africa all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why in our collection, it has been
collected many, many, many times and given
[SPEAKER_01]: different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this gives us an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are interested to
collaborate on this and dig deeper to find
[SPEAKER_01]: what gene this is, there's a sheet of
paper I'll have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to summarize, I think we have a
much better picture of the genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of our collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of work going on that I
think maybe other colleagues have
[SPEAKER_01]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a strong group from EDS that has
looked at the Kasaba HapMap and maybe Ramu
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to talk about that one of these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have implemented genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was talking to the graduate students
over lunch today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was asking them, like, how many
traits are you working on?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were saying, like, one trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing genomic selection for one trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be nice if I could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to produce something for farmers,
you have to have the whole package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been a challenging process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the excellent partnership that we
have, it has worked out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have done several cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have, from GWAS studies,
been able to map major genes of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of future prospects,
I think there are opportunities to
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a saying that I learned from David
Meyer from Dow AgroSciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, this is an African saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that there's an African saying
which says, if you want to go fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: you travel alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go farther,
you travel together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, when I'm here at Cornell,
we're talking with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of opportunities to work
together in many different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank, again, my
collaborators at IIT, the Cassava breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: group, led by Peter Kulako, who has given
me an excellent opportunity to work on our
[SPEAKER_01]: next-gen project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our colleagues at NRCRI, Chie Dozier-Guesi
and his team, Nakri in Uganda,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell University, Jean-Luc's lab,
particularly Manin, Dunia, and the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank BTI for the
excellent database that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: generated for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without that database,
we could not handle the data sets that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have been generating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are all publicly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to access our GBS data and
phenotypes, you can go there anytime and
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our JGI group for reference genome,
of course, Harvest Plus for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: carotenoid work that I've been working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots, tubers, and bananas, who are our
key CGI programs that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, our donors, the Gates
Foundation and the DFID of the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's clear why we're excited to
work with this kind of team in the
[SPEAKER_03]: next-gen project.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have questions, please,
yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you made a real convincing
argument that the PSY effect, it isn't the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was wondering, you looked at,
the expression of the locus to rule out
[SPEAKER_02]: expression differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am kind of concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it really is an amino acid change
there, that could have downstream effects
[SPEAKER_02]: on the EVA, which has a very plausible
effect on dry matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that babies avoid,
essentially, having a pleiotropic effect
[SPEAKER_02]: in the carotenoid pathway is the
carotenoid genes that matter are
[SPEAKER_02]: duplicated, or they're expression
differences that only affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: endosperm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you mess around with carotenoids
everywhere, I wouldn't doubt at all there
[SPEAKER_02]: is a dry matter effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done expression myself,
but there's a group that they first called
[SPEAKER_01]: these two, and they didn't have any
expression differences in the white group
[SPEAKER_01]: and the yellow group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they found a clear switch of the
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an amino acid, the correct
one, you have yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other, the non-functional one,
you don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the point you're making there
is quite important, because I have tried
[SPEAKER_01]: to be convinced that it's maybe a physical
linkage that's causing this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we cannot rule out pleiotropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I think it's an opportunity
to work on this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are groups like our colleagues at
SIA who are reporting clones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: both high dry matter and high carotenoids
in the same genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to get hold of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I wanted to mention is
that in our jumpers, the founding clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that was used, and is in the pre-grade for
the yellow clones, they're just a few
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions from the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look at their dry matter
content, they were horrible, like 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that was an indicator that this
narrow source came linked to the low dry
[SPEAKER_01]: matter gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I wanted to say is that in
that region, we have two key statuettes
[SPEAKER_01]: that exist as part of the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the eukospirofos modulus and the
sucrosin base, very close to PS42.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is at play.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started the yellow versus white story
with the bifernal population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that one segregated from the
intercession?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I get that wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two bifernals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is the very first bifernal,
I think, that you mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot say about the two bifernals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one has the second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if there is any possibility
that, do we know any information about the
[SPEAKER_04]: changing of virus population in
eukospirofos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any possibility that the virus
has evolved as it keeps the infected gene
[SPEAKER_04]: by mutation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the Germany virus is a rapidly
evolving type of virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a danger, especially for us,
since we are all depending on this major
[SPEAKER_01]: gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a single gene or a cluster of
genes, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, we have no cause for
alarm at the moment, because the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: have been there for ages, and they're
still not showing any break in the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resistance appears to be very
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a work by Roberto Januc's lab
who looked at the distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance genes in the cassava genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this region, we don't have this type of
NDS, NLH, kind of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that it's possibly something
that is confining resistance under
[SPEAKER_01]: different kind of mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smiley, the recent evaluation of RTB,
there was a recommendation that the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers, which are being developed by
geneticists, are not being utilized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: applied genes, especially in national
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you comment why, and what is it being
done for?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very important question,
and this sometimes keeps me awake at
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The promise of molecular markers in crop
improvement has been there for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are very few tangible
evidence of crops that have been bred
[SPEAKER_01]: using markers that have reached farmers,
and there are many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is that up until now,
the theory was there, but the tools were
[SPEAKER_01]: not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were using the classical SSR
markers in sparse genetic maps,
[SPEAKER_01]: the QTLs, they were there, but sometimes
not very strongly linked, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genotyping using those markers was very
expensive, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the service providers were not there,
like we have right now with the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation sequences, they were competing
for customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have been transitioning from
that space to where, like I showed in my
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, working with this large
community, we are able to generate these
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I'm working with
here with Guillaume from Lucas Ruler's lab
[SPEAKER_01]: is to compare these markers to allow
specific acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we will be able to convince
breeders to use them for the tricks that
[SPEAKER_01]: they are working on by doing all kinds of
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have now a CGR-wide platform
delivered in India that was just funded by
[SPEAKER_01]: the Gates Foundation that can genotype 10
markers for $2, including DNA extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have my Dr. Manson, or my CMD,
and I have a bunch of other traits that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have mapped, which I didn't have time to
show, if a breeder wants to select for
[SPEAKER_01]: those, they can assemble 10 markers that
are tagged in those major genes and
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly do it before a breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the last slides you mentioned,
you crossed one of these two clones that
[SPEAKER_03]: are practically identical phenotypically,
but have this divergent CMD phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many markers can you get that are
segregated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, these are heterozygous, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I try to explain to myself how
this thing works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first mapping population that we did
was with the resistant pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The susceptible pattern was actually this
clone that has a resistant pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had given the marker to the
breeder, they would be forced to be
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now what we want to do is to put
all this together and really zoom into
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing I'm thinking about is in
cancer genomics, if you want to zoom into
[SPEAKER_01]: the temptation of interest, you do very
deep sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for these two clones, you can do like
100 X, F, and focus on that region and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also interestingly, the other teams
working on transgenics, they find out that
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of resistance, when you put
things in the genic color, tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you bring them out, the resistance is
quenched, switched off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be also a possibility that
we're talking about a genetic kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know whether it's a genetic,
it's a trans-posible, and it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
This
[SPEAKER_00]: has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
