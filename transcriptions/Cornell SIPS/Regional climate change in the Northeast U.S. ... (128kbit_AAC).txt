[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I like to set the stage
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a very colorful kind of hectic
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what this is showing is
global carbon dioxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is time across the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can all see by the pink arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In kind of the spaghetti of all these
lighter lines, these are possible pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: that people came up with that society is
going to evolve in terms of their carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the point that I want to make
is the red line here is essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: path that we're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sometimes called the business as
usual scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it's saying is here we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're emitting about nine gigatons of
carbon per year in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move out, actually not too far,
this is not even mid century, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically doubling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically set to double our
carbon dioxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very, very short period of time,
30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also notice that this dashed line that I
put across is basically, I guess I was off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically current day emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really all of these other lines are
above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few cases that drop below
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really no matter what scenario you
pick, we're basically in the next 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years destined to emit more carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only these very, very unlikely
scenarios that drop us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to have some major
technological breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Society, the world in general,
including not only the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: but China and India are going to have to
drastically reduce their carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions if we hope to be on this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your eyes are really good,
basically, even though this is the IPCC
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate of business as usual,
we're actually above that trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a higher standard than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really a good picture here for
setting the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what that means is if we look at
a global perspective, we're on the road to
[SPEAKER_00]: a world that looks like this by the end of
the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really, really red.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is indicating here on a degree
C, across the Arctic average temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: that are 11, 12, 13 degrees warmer,
warmer than they are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're maybe more interested in our
neck of the woods, we're in the area here
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight or nine or 10 degrees C warmer
than we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice if you look at this map,
everybody is orange or red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world warms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at this map over here,
this is actually that, see if I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: back, that's actually more or less this
scenario here in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is kind of a pie in the sky,
boy, I wish we could get here type
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoops, wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we do that, this map is
particularly, you know, it's mostly red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we reduce the emissions to that
extent, the Arctic here is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: warming about four or five degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is on the order of one or two
degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're locked in with a certain amount
of warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide
today, the climate system has such
[SPEAKER_00]: inertia, the warming of the oceans and
things like that, the residual carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide in the atmosphere, we're locked
into a certain amount of warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I find this to be a
particularly kind of compelling graph to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just say, oh my God, we're in
trouble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do something, we have to adapt,
we have to mitigate, we have to modify our
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue line here is the observational
record of temperature for central New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, basically a grid box from a climate
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red and the yellow graphs are two
carbon dioxide emission scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the red is the higher emission
scenario, basically again, doubling CO2 by
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-century, almost quadrupling it by the
end of the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellow isn't quite that pie in the
sky, really low scenario, it's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: modest scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically puts us where we end up,
basically same CO2 emissions today in 100
[SPEAKER_00]: years as we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes up a little bit mid-century,
but then pops back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the net, we're accumulating more
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that over the next 40 or 50
years, these two lines are right on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, an idea of the inertia in the
climate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do right away doesn't really
affect the climate until, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically 50 years out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when those lines start to diverge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're locked into a certain
amount of climate change, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: what society does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, these two arrows
that come down, kind of hovering around
[SPEAKER_00]: 2050, represent the time when the new
record with climate change basically
[SPEAKER_00]: exceeds anything we've seen in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean, these points, if you look
at this point here and I guess this point
[SPEAKER_00]: here, these years are the coldest years in
this future record, but these years are
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer than any year we've seen in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, essentially, we're in a new
climate regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year that we would say is the coldest,
oh my God, it's cold here in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually warmer than any year we've
seen in the past based on these
[SPEAKER_00]: projections from two climate models under
two greenhouse gas standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not, again, not something that
we want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops, I forgot I had an image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to set the stage,
you know, I work with a number of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are looking at climate impacts and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I end up getting a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know not to, actually,
whenever I talk to a fruit growers group
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, they say,
how is climate change going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: hail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hail is the thing that really,
you know, does in my apple crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: does in my peach crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put up these hail nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should that be the type of thing that we
use for adaptation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So spend a little bit of time to kind of
describe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of a paper that myself and a
few colleagues put together in the book of
[SPEAKER_00]: the AMS about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was basically assess the
ability to detect different changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, you can kind of view this
horizontal axis as how good are our
[SPEAKER_00]: observations of these phenomena?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well can we look at the historical
record and say, yeah, there's been a trend
[SPEAKER_00]: in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's been a trend in
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vertical axis is really our
understanding of the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of the cause and effect
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look up here and I look at
something like precipitation or heat waves
[SPEAKER_00]: and cold waves, prolonged periods of hot
and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our observational record of temperature
and precipitation is actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it falls up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also our understanding of the causes
why an increase in greenhouse gases would
[SPEAKER_00]: cause temperature to go up, precipitation
to go up is fairly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet I might contrast that to these
things that kind of fall on this end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like hail or tornadoes or ice
storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we don't have a very good
observational record.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, basically ice storms are events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to, you know, the newspaper has to
report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to call that in to the
weather service before it gets into the
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our historical record of something like
that is not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, our understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is climate change going to affect
something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very poor in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think on ice storms, you can imagine
an ice storm even from your experience of
[SPEAKER_00]: ice storms around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a narrow, narrow band of
meteorological conditions that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: come together just at the right time,
just at the right levels of the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: to cause an ice storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of using a climate model to
project what's going to happen in that
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very narrow range of conditions is
very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, well, you're out of luck
if you really care about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I might as well take, again,
I'll take on Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewart's leads were, I don't know,
I'll throw the dart at the dartboard for
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we move up here to things like
temperature, precipitation, floods,
[SPEAKER_00]: droughts, cyclones, you know, we have a
better understanding of why those are
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring and a good historical record of
seeing what those changes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's quickly look back at what we've
seen in the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen, and basically these,
the next set of figures are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out of the National Assessment,
which has a chapter specific on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look at average temperatures,
no matter what season we're in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a statistically significant trend in
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pick on winter, basically what we've
seen is about a quarter of a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit trend per decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically over the 100 years that we've
had, we've seen about two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees of dark night warming already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest trend is in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most warming we've seen over the
last 100 or so years has been in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at extreme heat, so this is a
metric of four day average temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the five year return period, so like the
98% high or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme heat has not changed very much in
the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you we have more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The observational record doesn't support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at the opposite side,
same type of metric, but for cold spells
[SPEAKER_00]: in winter, and here again, a fairly
substantially statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: downward trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of winter warming being more
pronounced than summer warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the frost free season,
again, a statistically significant trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost over this period of time,
at least a week of lengthening of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see in the projections that this
is going to even get longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have quite a nice growing season if
climate change plays out or when climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at total annual precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a statistically significant upward
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looking at this, again,
it's a precipitation anomaly in inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've increased over this 100 years on
the order of four or five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 10% if we figure Hibig
against about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it really gets interesting,
at least in my mind and a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: research is focused on this, is extreme
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we have a subtle increase
in rainfall, but what really changes is
[SPEAKER_00]: the character of how that rainfall comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, kind of an index, so don't get
too upset by the seemingly small numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a derived value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a very significant,
actually almost if you look at the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: just in their magnitude, almost a doubling
of extreme precipitation events across the
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a five year return period daily
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three inch rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we can expect the frequency
or we've seen the frequency of two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four inch rainfall events nearly
double over the last 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Bill Fry a little bit and I
know Bill is always interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not the greatest graph,
but from some work a postdoc and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically we look, this is spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is daytime hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nighttime hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This set of graphs are temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature goes up everywhere
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big dots that kind of have the
black borders around them are
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the size of the dots represent
the magnitude of the trend, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the ones that have kind of the
black circles if your eyes are good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, those are statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much red dots over the entire
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the northern here statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring day, spring night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle graph is dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of dew point as really a
measure of the actual amount of vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially grams of water vapor in
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, whoops, going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even here, primarily red dots
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them, at least in the northern
tier, statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual amount of vapor in the
atmosphere has gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity in the last column is
just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how much vapor is in the atmosphere
relative to what the atmosphere can hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully most people in class,
or in class in here realize, and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: Trevor will learn this very quickly
because he's in my thermal class,
[SPEAKER_00]: that as we heat the atmosphere it can hold
more water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes more water vapor to saturate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what relative humidity is
measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measuring the ratio of the amount of
water vapor that's in the atmosphere to
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount that the atmosphere can hold
before it saturates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two things taken in concert with
one another actually show a decrease in
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most places, blue dots, and actually
over the northeast here a lot of circle
[SPEAKER_00]: dots, significant blue dots, a drop in
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the atmosphere warms so much
and even though the vapor goes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't go up enough to cause it to
change its relative saturation in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see the same thing in spring
maybe as we go to the relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: column.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much going on at night here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some spurious actually positive trends
across the northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an observational study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask me why that happens in that
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of evidence for what might go on
here in the Midwest in terms of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the increase in irrigation in
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding another source of moisture
perhaps to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last, I think my last slide for
looking back is days with snow cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to me remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number of days that have at
least an inch of snow on the ground in
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look over kind of an older
graph, but over a 30 year period,
[SPEAKER_00]: that number of days has declined by more
than 30 years, 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30 days fewer during winter when we
have at least an inch of snow on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what does the future hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say what the future holds,
we need to ask them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, most meteorologists,
most climatologists are more like Sheldon
[SPEAKER_00]: from Big Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our models look more like this than in
the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots and lots of math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially these equations that go
into, I mean it's just a smattering of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really the idea is if we look at the
climate system, this cartoonist of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: system, all of these things we need to
basically depict, represent
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only the amount of, whatever it is,
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how it changes in the sun's input
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the chemistry that's going on in
the atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only with CO2, but a whole range of
different gases, aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do the volcanoes go off?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an effect on the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the biosphere interact with the
atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in the cloud?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you kind of see lots and lots of
math equations to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of kind of integrations of
integrated systems that need to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: one another, things that happen on
different scales, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of just maybe a history
lesson, kind of the evolution of these
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in basically my time from grad school
till I guess I have to extend this graph
[SPEAKER_00]: to today, these models that we use to
simulate what the climate's gonna look
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the future have really evolved a
lot in terms of their complexity and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the components of the system that factor
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on here, we had the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model didn't even know about the
ocean, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until really we moved into the
early 90s that the ocean was actually part
[SPEAKER_00]: and an interactive part of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move today, you can see the
whole range of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon cycle is affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we warm the tundra and the methane
gets released, that's something that the
[SPEAKER_00]: model knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dynamic in the model now as opposed
to something I have to specify or guess at
[SPEAKER_00]: in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model works on a bunch of grids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically global climate models have a
resolution on the order.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest kind of state of the art models
has a round number, a degree of latitude
[SPEAKER_00]: by a degree of longitude for these grids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The models know about one value for these
boxes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one value of temperature for a
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one value of elevation for a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's an average over that one
degree by one degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grids go up into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grids go down into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the grid size varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to specify processes maybe
near the surface of the ocean that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: in a shower level, the boxes might be a
little bit narrower there than they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the deep ocean where it really doesn't
matter over hundreds of kilometers of
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say the same thing in the atmosphere,
some surface soil layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically working on boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe even here I'm going to mention
clouds because clouds are clearly one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest sources of uncertainty because
they fall between the cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these large grid boxes in the
GCMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physics are well represented at those
scales, kilometers, hundreds of kilometers
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at something like clouds,
to get the physics right, we need to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: micrometers, you know, 10 to the minus 6
as opposed to 10 to the third or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very hard mismatch in scale to get
the physics right in say something like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud and have it talk to the climate
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also clouds tend to occur on smaller
scales than these grid boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of to put this into perspective,
in this graph I think we're going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to this graph but look at the red
dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically if this is the United States
in a typical climate model the big red
[SPEAKER_00]: dots are the grid points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are essentially one, maybe you
can argue two grid points over the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the United States in a
typical state of the art today,
[SPEAKER_00]: present day climate model, it looks
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are its borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops, missing Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the Great Lakes are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one grid point over Lake Superior
so that's what the lakes look like for the
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a very crude representation
at the GCM scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a reflection of topography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if I go back, the model only knows
about one value for each of these red dots
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not surprising that the Rocky
Mountains look like a hump as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rocky Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually you notice very little here
over the Appalachian GCM scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what is done nowadays is
something that's called downscale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to have these global models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to say, boy, the global
temperature is going to change by this
[SPEAKER_00]: much over the next 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we start to talk about impacts
and adaptations, you know, people really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care about these large GCM grid
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know, well, I picked Europe
here, basically what's happening in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York or what's happening in the wine
growing region of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really kind of really, really focused
type data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we do that is downscaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really two ways that we can
downscale assignment model data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it statistically, basically
using regression or some statistical model
[SPEAKER_00]: to link the large scale climate model
variables to the local scale climate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can do it dynamically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use a finer resolution model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can feed the data from a large scale
climate model into a finer scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call RCM as a regional climate
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let the physics do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have their strengths and weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really state of the art is I can't
tell you one is better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably some reasons why you want
to do it statistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other reasons why you want to do
it dynamically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of these have really evolved
enough to say, yep, you would think maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it dynamically is the better way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, you really don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a few words of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, there's a whole cascade of
uncertainty when we're looking at maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: going from what the climate is going to be
like to, or what the climate is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, to what are the impacts going to
be or how should we adapt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the graphs that I've showed so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have uncertainty into how our CO2
emissions are going to evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what's society going to look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Given that society looks like something,
how is our CO2 emissions going to evolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could still be a very economically
driven society, very consumeristic
[SPEAKER_00]: society, but maybe we're going to do it
with renewables as opposed to fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe we're going to be kind of a more
sustainable society and we have a blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: fuels as opposed to going totally to
renewables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly uncertainties in global
models, clearly uncertainties in the
[SPEAKER_00]: downscaling techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you a set of downscaled data,
what would you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd probably put it into some model of
some plant pathogen or some yield model or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, unless I'm mistaken,
your models have uncertainties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another level of uncertainty
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the adaptation response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the plant's going to respond this
way and then I have to adapt to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's uncertainties in that adaptation
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a whole cascade of uncertainties from,
you know, do you think this is uncertain
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time you get down to here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well say I forget about it,
but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quickly, how is this downscaling
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of different ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the most simple is called the
delta method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is what we used in the
New York State climate assessment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the climate report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just based on the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it does is it takes the
climate model temperature for some
[SPEAKER_00]: historical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these climate models aren't only
running to the future, they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: running to the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the physics are allowed to run
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the climate model has some estimate of
what the climate looked like, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this base period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also has a projection for what
it looks like, say, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the delta is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference in the mean of those
two distributions, the historical model
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to downscale the data,
I maybe find the station I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: or the grid I'm interested in if I have an
observed gridded database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, all right, here's where I am in
this base period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I add the delta to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I have in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not rocket science here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, all it is is saying the
climate model changes by this much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mean through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add that to the current
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we used in the New York State
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this monthly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use this daily, I might say,
well, the climate model in July increased
[SPEAKER_00]: its mean temperature by five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to get a daily series of the
future, I might go back to July's at a
[SPEAKER_00]: station in the future and every day at
five degrees to that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't change the variance at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't change the day-to-day change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make everything warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's done sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's not state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much most of the statistical
downscaling, kind of a busy graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you might expect, it takes some
set of pretty predictive variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be temperature at that large GCM
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it develops some type of a
relationship using a statistical model,
[SPEAKER_00]: either a regression, an analog approach,
a neural network, or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: to derive a statistical relationship,
a statistical model, to get you the
[SPEAKER_00]: downscaled value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might start off with temperature at
the GCM scale, do your statistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and end up with temperature in it,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe instead of temperature,
I take the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I become a meteorologist and I say,
OK, this is what the weather map looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the heights are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the amount of moisture in the
atmosphere is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use those as predictors through some
statistical technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get temperature, or snowfall,
or precipitation, or humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone get that basic concept there,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last way to do this is
dynamically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really here, we have our model at the
GCM scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our finer resolution regional
climate model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's the GCM that feeds in and
gives this model its boundary conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data that's input to this finer
scale, which might know, at least in my
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, here about the Alps, or the
United States, about the Rockies,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the Adirondacks, or the Great Lakes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, the Great Lakes really
aren't the climate model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This regional model is able to resolve
that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundary conditions feed into the
edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of keeps it, is the northeast in a
trough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the northeast in a ridge on a given day
at the large scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how does that play out at the
finer scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the typical US boundary in a
regional climate model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see that increase in
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see most of the Great Lakes,
although I would argue Ontario and Erie
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't really represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: No finger lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not kind of keeping the scale
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can obviously see a lot more
definition of the Rocky Mountains,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of hard to see here, but also an
indication of the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's getting that physics right,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can solve the physics of what's going
to happen with changes in elevation and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that much better on a much
finer scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than we might have in the global sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so no matter what we do in
terms of downscaling, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of bias,
and actually some downscale extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is dynamically downscaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the colored box plots represent a
different combination of the global model
[SPEAKER_00]: and a different regional model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what I'm trying to predict
here, I think it's the 100 year storm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in terms of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some combinations do
pretty pathetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 25 or more percent lower than they
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some combinations are spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The width of the box plot represents how
well do these models work for about 150
[SPEAKER_00]: stations in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scale of these box plots are New
York, and basically the spread represents
[SPEAKER_00]: how well can these downscaling techniques
represent the changes in extreme rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: at all of these stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, even though these might look
pretty good in the median, on average no
[SPEAKER_00]: bias, there is a fair amount of spread in
the box plots, on the order of maybe 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a different approach, same type of
thing, but with an analog approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: a statistical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here this might be an
example where you might argue,
[SPEAKER_00]: boy, those look a lot better in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lot more closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bias tends to be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spread of the box plots, particularly
with this statistical method, seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you an idea of,
I think, not only the uncertainty in doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but also to really know one way is
better than the other in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to look at a number of
different ways to kind of come up to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of downscale am I going to use
for this parameter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the latest state-of-the-art
downscale temperature projection for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a NASA product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It downscales the climate of 2,100 in July
at 800 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I said, boy, you want to use this
product in your research, what would you
[SPEAKER_00]: say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this like state-of-the-art?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm going to say, fire beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the point that I want to make here,
yeah, it's easy to downscale to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: scale you want, but there's only so much
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can slice and dice the current
observations down to 100 meters if I want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are you going to believe that value?
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Alan Lapso a little bit and
his temperature sensors in the finger
[SPEAKER_00]: lanes, just looking at vineyards and
slopes down to the lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the data, how hard it was,
to try to model that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, okay, yeah, you can go on the
web and find this downscale product at a
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution of eight football fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as an example, again,
with these downscale products,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is no different from really what we
do in weather forecasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you watch Dave Icahn or Wayne
Mahargaffer did or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, when they're looking at
what goes on in the finger lakes or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Lakes, they're really doing a form
of this dynamical downscale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking a large-scale weather
forecasting model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a regional model that
knows about the finger lakes, knows about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Great Lakes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my example is, since it rained on
Saturday morning, I put together my talk
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a weather forecasting model
for Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking, how much did it,
remember it rained on Saturday morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what I did was, how much did
the model predict was going to fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca versus how much it actually did?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this example, spot-on.
Spot-on.
But another, oops.
Ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, darn it, messed up my, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, you know, it's spot-on in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I look, say, a different spot,
if I look up at Messina, the model was
[SPEAKER_00]: predicting 0.55.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only got 0.06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this idea of the finest of the
models that you look at, you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have, you know, they're not going
to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this increase in resolution doesn't
necessarily mean higher accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, now, back to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the temperature going to look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of slides have come out of the
National Assessment, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are laid out sort of
like this, where the slides on your lab
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled A2 are a hot, hot slide emission
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that business-as-usual
scenario, where we double CO2 over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next 50 years, quadruplet over the next
100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The B1 scenario is a lower emission
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one where we kind of peak emissions
mid-century and then come back down so
[SPEAKER_00]: that by 2100, we're about where we are
today, about eight or nine, I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes apart every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the row across the top is
mid-century, kind of the period from 2040
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2070.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bottom is the end of the
century, 2070 to basically 2100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look across the Northeast,
you know, the big contrast, mid-century,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, doesn't matter, really,
what we do in terms of emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of the century matters a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of red in the high emissions and not
a lot in the low emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this big, you know, the bright red
here, essentially switching back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: in units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, that's a pitfall of doing
meteorology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the order of eight or nine
degrees Fahrenheit, warmer at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the century than we are today on average
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: By mid-century, maybe about four degrees,
probably warmer than we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the low emission scenario,
a little bit better, maybe about two
[SPEAKER_00]: versus maybe about five there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, when the national
assessment was done, it was done on an
[SPEAKER_00]: older generation of climate models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the newer model runs for the
international panel on climate change were
[SPEAKER_00]: being run at the time the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: did the national assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of looking at this, and I know
this is not a great graph, but what this
[SPEAKER_00]: is intended to show is the difference
between the older generation of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: models that the national assessment was
based on versus the early runs of these
[SPEAKER_00]: new models that are going into the IPCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this graph,
especially across the Northeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of yellow and orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow and orange are a number greater
than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that says, the newer models show
an increase in the warming as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the older models by about a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The warming projected occurs across all
seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of looking at the past
observations and saying most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: warming has been in the winter doesn't
play out as we go into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go into the future, the amount of
warming in the winter is really just about
[SPEAKER_00]: the same if not a little bit less than
what we see in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at very hot days in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the number of days that have
a maximum temperature greater than 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look kind of here in our neck of
the woods, that number goes up by about
[SPEAKER_00]: four to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people who have lived here in
Ithaca know that a day above 95 is not
[SPEAKER_00]: unheard of, but very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this is saying is that on average
by kind of mid-century, we can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: about four or five of those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down here in my neck of the
woods where I grew up in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about 14 or 15 more of
those days per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cold days become a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a misnomer here in color,
but if I look up across the North Country
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Adirondacks, these are days with
minimum temperature below 10 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, and we see a decrease of about
20 to 25 of those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these very, very cold days become less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that whole distribution shifting
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free speed period increases by about three
weeks by the middle of the century,
[SPEAKER_00]: middle to end of the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity, again, sorry for a
fuzzy graph, but notice the dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue lines are the zero lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically here, this is the western
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is central North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the study that I swiped and didn't
reference for this didn't do anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the eastern U.S., but as you can see,
most of the projections across a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in temperature are again showing
decreases in relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is the temperature continues to
go up and the absolute level of moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to go up, but they don't match.
[SPEAKER_00]: They match up and you end up with
relatively lower RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are average rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rainfall goes up by about five,
six percent, go through the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets even worse in the new generation
of climate models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually goes up by about 10% more than
the older generation we're showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting though, the majority,
the lion's share of that increase is
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at summer, in all of the
models, in all of the scenarios,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's basically a wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can easily go, it can easily get higher
or lower in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you can say summer stays
about like it is, but all of this increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in rainfall is really a winter time
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, meteorologically makes a lot
of sense if you kind of think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: winters getting warmer and being able to
hold more water vapor and have bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at these extreme rainfall events,
like two, three extreme rainfall events,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the frequency of these go up actually
tremendously across New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a percent change on the order
of 25, almost 30% in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think this, this idea of extreme
rainfall playing out is a big impact for
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the northeast, but particularly
New York in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is some of our work,
and it's actually showing a 100-year
[SPEAKER_00]: storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the amount of rainfall you would
expect to see in a 100-year storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100-year storm for Ithaca is about a
six-inch rainfall in a day, and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: projecting kind of by the end of the
century is for that to go up on about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 100-year storm, 40% more rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that the other way around a
storm, you would expect to occur now every
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years, occurs about every 60 or 50
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big change in the frequency of these
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry period length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, you often hear that we're going
to have more short-term drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of plays out for the
southern part of the region, but as we
[SPEAKER_00]: move across New York it's kind of blue to,
blue to brown transition is essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of shorter-term prolonged dry
periods with no rain really doesn't play
[SPEAKER_00]: out, but that doesn't necessarily say that
the amount of rain you get in these events
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of goes up, it's just that it rains,
so the period of time between rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine even if this doesn't
change, but if your rainfall events are a
[SPEAKER_00]: half an inch versus a tenth of an inch,
that makes a big difference in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was, all right,
so kind of being almost right on time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just some closing thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downscale projections are not fact,
they're a guide, they're a gauge,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the best we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying don't use them,
but I'm saying beware of the uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also kind of my pet peeve,
finer resolution does not do better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just means we diced it a little bit
finer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically all of the downscaling
represents changes in mean, really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about changes in the variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are actually some runs from
actually the last national assessment that
[SPEAKER_00]: first started to look at changes in
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are an average over a bunch of
models, and say basically in some seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: and some periods of time the variance goes
up, in others it goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you looked at this and you had at
least one kind of cohesive message on this
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, maybe summer and fall have higher
variance, and maybe winter has lower
[SPEAKER_00]: variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point that I want to make is don't
necessarily read into this too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if I had a different graph and
actually showed the variance change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different models, basically they're all
over the place, and these are just the
[SPEAKER_00]: means that are coming out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very important, I mean we're
actually doing some work on frost risk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of looking at the risk of frost
damage to crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the average temperature goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially as the average temperature
goes up, the risk of frost doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: change that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it does is it happens at a different
time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still, I don't know,
if there's a 10% chance that this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: gets zapped by frost currently,
there's still a 10% chance that that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of happening in May, it might
happen in April in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the whole cycle is kind of
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just earlier and earlier in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you superimpose a change in
variance on that, actually a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: change in variance, something on the order
of five or 10%, you get a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in frost risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of a potential impact
of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say frost risk is going to go
up under climate change, which I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily agree with, and kind of doing
this to see that it's really something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being driven by the changes in
variance as opposed to changes in mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we don't have a very good
handle on, particularly in our downscale
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically just to leave it,
obviously the climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, remember, our emissions are
obviously important for future generations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the magnitude of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless of what we're going to do,
we've got to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have some time for a few
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
