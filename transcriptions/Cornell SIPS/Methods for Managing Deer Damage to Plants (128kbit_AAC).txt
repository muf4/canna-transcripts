[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have a chance to talk with you
about deer and deer-related impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved with deer research on
campus for about 25 years, and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: constant problem that doesn't seem to go
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only gets worse in many parts of the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk about a bit on deer
biology and management and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we've done locally over the
last few years in terms of research to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get ahead of some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're far from solving the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when a couple local
communities were starting to make some
[SPEAKER_01]: inroads, they're all aware there's lots of
associated impacts with deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a health and safety and economic
standpoint, deer vehicle collisions are
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we estimate on New York highways we
hit probably 100,000 deer a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no exact figures because every
municipality, every police organization
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to tally things a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Ag and Markets and New York
Farm Bureau and did a survey of deer
[SPEAKER_01]: damage to agriculture back in the early
2000s and realized that deer at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: were causing about $59 million a year in
economic impacts to agriculture in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the plant industry alone, if you look
at the horticulture industry, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly around $10 million of losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these are pretty large economic
impacts for one species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about damaged,
primarily woody, ornamentals and
[SPEAKER_01]: perennials today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forest regeneration failure is one big
issue with deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a current project with New York
State DEC looking at trying to assess deer
[SPEAKER_01]: forest impacts and forest regeneration
failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you change habitat, then that
influences things like songbirds,
[SPEAKER_01]: reptiles and amphibians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you change the species diversity of
small mammals, that really influences
[SPEAKER_01]: ticks and tick-borne diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these things tend to be
interrelated and we'll touch a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: on all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got deer problems in and around
your community, it really depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, on an individual property,
probably the most cost effective thing are
[SPEAKER_01]: some type of exclusion devices and we'll
talk about each of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have tried frightening devices with
pretty poor success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant selection, I'll touch on some
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Bridgen is going to follow up later
with some more detailed list on plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that tend to be deer resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about repellents and population
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about an IPM context,
what you're trying to do is look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: best combination of what's available that
fits your landscape or your property to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get the damage down to a tolerable
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exclusion can be something as simple as
say black, heavy netting on metal stakes
[SPEAKER_01]: in a garden, small garden, kitchen garden
type of bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have tried monofilament lines on
different configurations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer tend to figure those out pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tend not to work very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of types of fencing,
high tensile woven wire is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the most resilient to deer
damage and all sorts of other metal and
[SPEAKER_01]: wire guards that you might see
commercially sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can keep the deer away from the
plant materials at the times when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive, that generally solves the
problem over the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frightening devices, you'll see all sorts
of these squawk boxes that emit sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are supposed to scare deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested a shoe root.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shoe root device years ago that
was supposedly scaring deer out of apple
[SPEAKER_01]: orchards that did absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the auditory devices deer are
smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figure out what's real danger and
what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hear a noise several times,
nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to pay any attention to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visual repellents, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people put coyote decoys out and
around their farm and plant in golf
[SPEAKER_01]: courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them use these coyotes to keep
deer and geese away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both the deer and geese quickly figure
out that those are decoys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: They present no real danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're a waste of time and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odor repellents are useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that when I get to the
repellent section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultrasonics, and I'll talk a bit
more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultrasonics haven't shown to have any real
success with deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention it briefly when we get to the
vehicle collisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of repellents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the products today are formulated
with the generally regarded as safe
[SPEAKER_01]: materials because they avoid EPA
registration with the grass-listed
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, most of them have never
been tested under replicated experimental
[SPEAKER_01]: settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would doubt looking at active
ingredients allow those things work at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one chemosterolent registered for
deer nationally by a federal EPA,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not registered in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonocon immunocontraceptive vaccine is
registered, but not used in very many
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an experimental drug for
controlling deer populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: High cost, high expense, continued
maintenance, and just the delivery system
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of population control,
most state wildlife agencies, New York
[SPEAKER_01]: included, will try to first solve problems
with managed hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of different ways to hunt
deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to focus on the female segment of
the herd, because that's your reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: segment that's going to control your
population biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do things like DMPs,
your regular doe tags at any hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get in most parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go up a level, more intensive
management, DMP, deer management assistant
[SPEAKER_01]: program tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are antlerless only tags issued to
individual landowners, usually farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: forest landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had them on university properties for
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they allow you to take a specific
number of antlerless deer during the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular hunting season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the landowner applies for the tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be, I think, a 50-acre minimum
acreage requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the tags out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recruit hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to remove antlerless deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step up in aggressiveness is deer
damage permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tags to be used outside the
normal hunting season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the permits are given out for
agricultural growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you've got a strawberry
grower going to try to get a crop off in
[SPEAKER_01]: June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And deer are coming in at night hammering
the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can apply for a deer damage permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually issued very quickly,
set number of tags, decided on by the
[SPEAKER_01]: regional DC deer biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are non-hunting permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows the use of bait, artificial
light, shooting at night, usually until 11
[SPEAKER_01]: p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEC will look at the damage,
estimate number of tags needed if the
[SPEAKER_01]: landowner has got safe shooting zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, deer management focus
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing, that was started in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only one in the state right now is
here in Tompkins County area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a special deer focus area because
we've done so much research and management
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that allows is any licensed big game
hunter in New York State can apply and get
[SPEAKER_01]: free antlerless tags online from the DEC
website if they register.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every hunter can take two antlerless
deer per day every day of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting season.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, they can take two antlerless
deer per day during a special three week
[SPEAKER_01]: January season that's the only January
season in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're putting a ton of hunting
effort in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it done any good in reducing our deer
impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hasn't made a measurable difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the points I want to try
to get across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually hunting programs alone,
no matter how intensive they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: just usually don't, they help.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt they help, but they
aren't going to solve a problem because
[SPEAKER_01]: deer are smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figure out the safe havens very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to be smart and know deer
behavior and how to hunt deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a handful of skilled hunters on a
damage permit can do more than 400 hunters
[SPEAKER_01]: on regular hunting season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you some data in a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer related vehicle accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nationwide back in the early 90s,
there was a national survey done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was estimated there were 726,000
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dan Decker did some surveys here in
New York and found that of accidents that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually occurred only to 20 to 50% ever
got reported anywhere on a police database
[SPEAKER_01]: or an insurance claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can certainly say, well,
about half the accidents got reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that $726,000 jumps up to a million
and a half likely deer accidents in a
[SPEAKER_01]: single year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That number's probably gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at an average cost back then of $3,000
per vehicle for repairs, that's $4.5
[SPEAKER_01]: billion in economic losses annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw some current data now on
average based on insurance records of
[SPEAKER_01]: about $6,000 per vehicle on average for
repairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those numbers have just all escalated
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot about deer behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know 60% of the deer vehicle accidents
that occur in New York every year are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to occur during October,
November, and December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And November's the worst month every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in November that causes
that?
The rut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mating season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bucks are chasing does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deer aren't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crossing roads more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what's going on when you get to the
change in the daylight savings time and
[SPEAKER_01]: standard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts the peak in deer activity at
sunrise and sunset right at the peak of
[SPEAKER_01]: driving time morning and evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the combination of those two things
causes accidents to really spike at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another little blip these data
don't pick up right here in May and June.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually, if you had real data for
it, we pick it up from our collar deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in late May, early June?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fawning season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens before the adult female
deer gives birth to this year's fawns,
[SPEAKER_01]: she kicks last year's fawns out of her
home range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got yearling deer for the
first time with no mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have to go out and set up
their own territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're wandering everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main highway corridor is on 81,
I-90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that blip if you watch,
particularly at that time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Education for motorists is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get lots of PSAs and announcements
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is we don't change our
behavior very readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how long it took and how much
enforcement it took to put seatbelt walls
[SPEAKER_01]: in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how about enforcement on texting and
driving and trying to call on your phone
[SPEAKER_01]: and driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just education alone just doesn't solve
unless you've got enforcement behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be careful driving near dawn or
dusk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peak times of deer activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer and creatures a habit where you see
deer across the road once.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're likely to see them again in your
normal daily travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, note those places in the back of
your mind when you're traveling to work or
[SPEAKER_01]: school or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scan the roadsides for eye reflections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what those look like at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might give an extra two seconds to
slow down if you can recognize an eye
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection and miss a deer versus having
an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always encourage communities to
manage her density where possible because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a direct density-dependent function.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher deer density on the landscape,
the higher probability of contact you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have on high-speed highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bells and whistles don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of ultrasonics and gimmicks
that have been sold over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these things have any effect on
deer behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even clear that deer can hear in
the ultrasonic range that these devices
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about animals that communicate by
sound long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whales, the elephant, they use
infrasound.
[SPEAKER_01]: That very low spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about somebody with a young driver
pulling up with a bass on his vehicle next
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really carries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultrasound is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tires on your car probably produce
more ultrasonic noise than these things
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, that's just a waste of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll talk a little bit about ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's working outdoors in the
plant industry needs to be aware of ticks
[SPEAKER_01]: and tick-borne diseases because they're on
the increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two dominant species we really got to
worry about are black-legged or deer
[SPEAKER_01]: ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how small the adults are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect most all of you have heard about
Lyme disease and can recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: black-legged ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one on Long Island in
southeastern New York that's getting to be
[SPEAKER_01]: of equal importance, if not more so,
is the lone star tick, named for the white
[SPEAKER_01]: spot on the back of the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone stars transmit ehrlichiosis,
which has very similar symptoms to Lyme
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my field staff that was working
with Dan Gilroy down on Long Island years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago had several ticks, but I thought she
had continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had contracted Lyme disease,
went to her doctor, and got tested twice,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the Lyme tests kept coming back
negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally said, well, test for this
whole panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four major tick-related diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, she had ehrlichiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was treated for that and recovered
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, again, there's more than one disease
that you've got to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, the lone star tick is the
primary vector for ehrlichiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black-legged tick, anaplasmosis is really
on the increase in different parts of New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to start watching for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lyme, you're all aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babesiosis, I haven't seen much recent
data on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more than one tick-borne
disease out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've been bitten by a tick,
you know it, you're not feeling well,
[SPEAKER_01]: see a physician as soon as possible and
see if you can sort it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually it's those top four
diseases, the ones that they screen for
[SPEAKER_01]: when they do the incomplete IgA,
IgG panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we manage tick-borne diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: Such Lyme, a lot of communities are trying
to reduce deer numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put question marks at that because
the data are not encouraging on reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: deer number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Past island studies and past research has
shown for black-legged tick populations to
[SPEAKER_01]: crash, you've got to get deer densities
below about six to eight deer per square
[SPEAKER_01]: mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's not enough deer in the
landscape to perpetuate and keep the Lyme
[SPEAKER_01]: disease and tick spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would folks guess average deer
densities around here are?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I went over to West Hill just on the
other side of town, what would you guess
[SPEAKER_01]: deer densities might be on West Hill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody got a number you can throw out?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to 30 per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about 100 short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere I measured around here with
infrared-triggered cameras, I pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently come up with about 120 to 125
deer per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what was in Village of Cugo Heights
before we started a program we had close,
[SPEAKER_01]: not quite that high on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had about just under 100 deer per
square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast area where we've done camera
surveys, we've come up with 125 deer per
[SPEAKER_01]: square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty typical suburban densities,
particularly in non-hunted areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your chances of getting down to
six deer per square mile?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 100 plus on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost near zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I question it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to sell something that I
don't think is going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Eastern Long Island's worse than
around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing work out on Shelter
Island, we were estimating densities of
[SPEAKER_01]: 250 per square mile on Shelter Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern Long Island, just incredibly high
deer densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark's well aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you've got high deer densities,
you want to protect plant materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: fencing to exclude or protect areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fencing is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I recommend to communities of
tick-borne diseases or problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: fence children's playgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fence small public spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public areas where there's high chance for
interaction of particularly children and
[SPEAKER_01]: where you don't want deer on the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Self-application of acarasides like
Promethon with a four-poster device.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested those on Long Island over a
three-year period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, working with Dan Gilroy down there,
we saw about a 95% reduction in tick
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers on Long Island with a four-poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in New York State, they're only
registered for use on Long Island right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't use them anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue is potentially baiting deer
and potentially increasing population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless something changes with DC Bureau
of Wildlife, that's a very limited tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four-poster device is that picture on
the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big corn hopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got 200 pounds of corn in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got these sort of paint rollers
on springs, two on each end, and a feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: trowel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a certified pesticide applicator comes
in weekly, measures the amount of corn
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed in the device, can estimate
number of deer visiting, and then knows
[SPEAKER_01]: how much Promethon spray to put on the
roller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a deer reaches its head into the
device, it's self-medicating, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: Promethon in a dog collar or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really does, if you can get the
right density of devices out, it really
[SPEAKER_01]: does cut back on tick loads and number of
ticks that deer are carrying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, and that's part of the
concern DEC has.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing, addressing any of the
other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only addressing the ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do some landscaping type of things
for black-legged ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this doesn't work as well for
lone star ticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone stars are more of a warm season tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like more warm grassy areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But black-legged ticks are more of a cool
season tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like shaded, cool, moist area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can try to put wood chip pads,
for example, around your yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then keep the yard well-mowed and
clean, not having any debris, so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can try to, again, create a barrier
between the tick habitat and the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean a deer can't wander
across your yard and not drop a tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ticks themselves won't migrate
very large distances, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: desiccate easily in full sun or across
very dry areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit about landscape plant
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the mid-'90s, there was a national
survey done by Mike Conover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he estimated there were about $250
million in damage to the plant industry
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a huge underestimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a survey in Westchester County
alone back in the late 1980s and found
[SPEAKER_01]: there were $6.5 to $9.5 million in plant
losses in one county in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the way that national survey
was designed, they just missed a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, plant replacement cost averaged
about $500 per home with deer damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the really important thing is we
learned that things that are evergreen,
[SPEAKER_01]: woody ornamentals that are evergreen,
used rhododendron arborvitae, are the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are most frequently damaged by
deer during the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they select them out in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reducing damage, repellents work best when
the deer pressure and damage is light,
[SPEAKER_01]: short-term, and most areas in New York
State now are beyond that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fencing provides the only reliable
protection when the deer damage gets
[SPEAKER_01]: moderate to heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, trying to manage deer densities and
keep numbers down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know each adult deer eats six to eight
pounds of forage a day when your precious
[SPEAKER_01]: plant materials that's a lot of plant
material that they can go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose plants that are less
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark's going to follow up and talk much
more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to emphasize deer feeding is
illegal in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people still like to feed deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're feeding particularly within
300 feet of a public highway, you will
[SPEAKER_01]: likely get a citation from the
environmental conservation officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of fencing, barrier,
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put up an eight foot high woven
wire fence that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's completely deer proof in
the last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you put your cost up on front and not
worry about it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower right, homeowners design all
sorts of types of fences.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one has a four foot high wire barrier
on the bottom and single strands of wire
[SPEAKER_01]: with flagging up above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The upper right is the Cornell Arboretum
where they cage individual trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: shrubs they want to protect and plastic
netting on wooden stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all different ways to protect
plant materials from deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it won't fix your budget and your
cost and how much area you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know from past research that several
commercially available deer repellents do
[SPEAKER_01]: provide some success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big game repellent are deer away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And repeated trials we've done have been
our best option so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: The active ingredient is putrescent egg
solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer hate the smell of putrescent eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hinder is relatively decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a soap based product, very wide
labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it on food crops too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deeroff did fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination of the putrescent egg
solids and capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bony rabbit deer repellent used to be
thyrum and got sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That label got sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's essentially the same ingredients
as Deeroff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot sauce is capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that hot peppers taste like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very high concentration of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good deer and elk repellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tree Guard is a bittering agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denitone and benzoate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer pay almost no attention to bittering
agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't waste your time and money on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are full of bitter compounds that
deer have learned how to detoxify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spot tree death is a fungicide that's
registered as a deer repellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thyrum is the active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: High concentration of the thyrum is a
pretty decent deer repellent, though not
[SPEAKER_01]: as good as the rotten eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done lots of trials over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to test deer repellents when the
deer are the hungriest.
[SPEAKER_01]: January, February, March when we've got
three, four, five inches of snow on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get horticultural plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Japanese used, bald and burlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat them indoors under good conditions
with different repellents and take them
[SPEAKER_01]: out and place them in the landscape when
there's snow cover on the ground and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens when deer are really hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you a really good test of how a
repellent works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of our control ewes after
two weeks in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see about half the plant surface
area is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer tracks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, ewes are one of the winter candy
for deer around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our repellent trials, you can see
we tested the big game repellent with mix
[SPEAKER_01]: and spray, both different types here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also deer off was putrescent egg solids
and deer stopper had putrescent egg
[SPEAKER_01]: solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the top four.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw no damage during the first four
weeks of the experiment with these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go downhill pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the take home message with repellents,
a decent deer repellent with putrescent
[SPEAKER_01]: egg solids or a really high concentration
of capsaicin and thiam will give you about
[SPEAKER_01]: four to five weeks of decent protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it loses efficacy at weathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're around here in the middle of
winter, you're not going to be doing any
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying in January, February,
and March.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've sprayed late November,
say you had a good day, you could get some
[SPEAKER_01]: spray on, by the end of December,
beginning of January, that material is
[SPEAKER_01]: gone and your plants are susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sprays have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend not to work for over winter
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: For simple homeowner application,
we've toyed some with these rope fences
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can be very effective for small
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: White cotton cord on green stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably can't see it, but there's green
cotton cloth suspended here in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we treated those cloth strips with a
big game repellent, the odor-based deer
[SPEAKER_01]: repellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's flower head density on that
control bed in the foreground was the same
[SPEAKER_01]: as the planting bed in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: During summer, very simple fences will
keep deer out of small kitchen garden
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, small planting areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get something elaborate
and expensive because deer have lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: green stuff to eat in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll fail miserably other times of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned a lot about deer behavior in
suburbia in the last 20 years of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of things that influence
deer feeding pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's marks, licks,
whether it's my list, I get calls all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so-and-so plants on your deer
resistant and they eat it in my yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my neighbor two houses away,
they don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's all these different things
related to deer behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Population density.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many miles do you have to feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Food and cover sources and travel quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that's relatively
deer resistant, most of the time that will
[SPEAKER_01]: work fine and you don't need to protect
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your home happens to live on a
travel quarter where deer are there every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and every night, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even those resistant plants start to get
eaten and the list don't work all that
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that deer won't take during spring,
summer and fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a little snow on the ground,
tough winter, they'll hammer in the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: months when they don't have alternative
foods and the season isn't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer nutrition is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are their fat reserves like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been a really tough winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen deer eat vinca to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pack a sandwich, which they don't
usually eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of a tough winter when they're
at starvation mode and they're just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to put something in their room and they
get through to green up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant palatability and nutrients are
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer can sense nitrogen in plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We fertilize our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're craving nitrogen and they pick the
high nitrogen plants in natural habitats
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll go and pick the highly
fertilized plants in the home landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: In previous experience, I learned the hard
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Miller and I did a trial years ago
with some experimental and Asiatic lilies
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to look at deer resistance of
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put containerized lilies out in ten
different homeowner sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: In seven of the ten sites, the lilies were
hammered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet in three of the sites, deer were in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got them on camera and the lilies
weren't touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were sitting there scratching their
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously no deer resistance to
these lilies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got hammered seven out of ten sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we realized is in those specific
homeowner sites, where we had them,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were no other lilies in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer hadn't recognized them as food yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that adult doe will teach her
offering what's palatable and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they sample them, they don't have any
protection anymore because they know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something good to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, all these behavior things make it
really difficult to predict sometimes what
[SPEAKER_01]: plants will and won't be taken in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are what I consider woody
ornamentals that are starvation foods for
[SPEAKER_01]: deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of the last thing on the list
that they'll take.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're eating Colorado blue spruce,
there's not much else out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with boxwood that we talked
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a starvation food for deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice this list is very short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer will eat just about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some careful plant selection,
you can design a more deer resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape where you can probably avoid
spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably avoid the cost of
fencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end of the spectrum,
these are plant materials that are
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently severely damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things deer seek out,
woody ornamentals in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your balsam and frazier firs on
there, your fruit trees, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: euonymus they love, things with big tasty
bugs like rhododendrons and azaleas,
[SPEAKER_01]: your ashes, yews, arborvitae.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got these type of plant
materials and there are many deer around
[SPEAKER_01]: at all, they're probably going to require
protection during the winter months or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're likely to suffer damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill, Miller and I did a study with
perennial bulbs a decade or so ago looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at deer resistance of a variety of
different bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just put them out cafeteria style in
the homeowner's yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, again, about two dozen different
cafeterias set up in a home landscape in a
[SPEAKER_01]: community where there were around 100 deer
per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to see what's typical,
what survives at 100 deer per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And either the bulbs were all grown in the
greenhouse here on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can read down the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to repeat all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our control were tulips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know deer love tulips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you tried to grow tulips in deer
country, you're probably going to need to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect them in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just went out during the spring
and then followed each of these plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at survivorship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, deer would come along and
pull the pots out of the trays,
[SPEAKER_01]: eat what they liked, ignore what they
didn't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could get a really good measure
of what was deer resistance in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no big surprise, the amine damage
score was highest for tulips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crocuses were highly favored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they liked kinodoxis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the rest of the stuff was
pretty darn deer resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rarely take a narcissus or a
hyacinth, rarely take iris or allium or
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of your spring bulbs are,
if you can avoid the tulips and crocuses,
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have to have tulips and
crocuses, better be considering some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of deer protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did cage feeding trials with
voles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a vole colony on campus years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave weighed vole material to pairs
of voles in cages to see if the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that were deer resistant were also vole
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, almost everything that
the deer would need, the voles didn't need
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants have some types of
secondary compounds that give them
[SPEAKER_01]: herbivore resistance or protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that was really neat,
I guess, we found out is this Colchicum
[SPEAKER_01]: actually killed the voles in the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to stop feeding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only plant on that list that
was toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But voles just couldn't even eat the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conifers, we've done surveys with tree
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, no big surprise here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing firs, those are the most
susceptible to deer damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the opposite end of the spectrum
are your spruces, particularly blue
[SPEAKER_01]: spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your white pine, the pine's the most
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And red pine and Austrian pine,
aren't all that susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the conifers you can get away
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbing damage is not feeding damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter how resistant your
plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the bucks are going to rub trees,
they're going to rub trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, the only way to stop this
damage is to fence deer out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: planting completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or get a DEC damage permitted if you've
got safe shooting zones and remove that
[SPEAKER_01]: problem buck that's causing all of your
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a buck might go in on territory
bounding and rub 50 or 100 trees in one
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a huge economic loss for a
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll just briefly wrap up and talk
about some of the research that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing on and around campus for the last
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking again, trying to understand deer
behavior and particularly population
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology, population biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we decide to do, most communities
that want to control deer, either you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got all the sort of the animal welfare
folks and we can't kill any deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No blood on the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go contraceptives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, okay, well, that's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can only do it with a research
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they get the other group that wants to
shoot them all and do everything they can
[SPEAKER_01]: to remove them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, well, why are these two
groups opposed to each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the same goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to reduce deer number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in core campus, right where we're
sitting, we can't carry firearms or bows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had a ton of deer here a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet all those red lands are Cornell
owned properly, mostly the south,
[SPEAKER_01]: north and east of here that are huntable
and have been hunted for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, well, why do one or the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do both and see if we could get some
synergy out of using both methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a sterilization trial on core
campus so we could hunt, then did a
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled hunting program on the lands
adjacent to campus best as we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we captured marked deer and trap,
ear tagged all the deer captured,
[SPEAKER_01]: put radio collars on a bunch of the adult
females, and then looked at their behavior
[SPEAKER_01]: and movements.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took all the female deer to the College
of Veterinary Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of willing students who
needed some experience and essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: spayed them, just like you would your dog
or your cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then took them back out, put them on
campus under our research permit just to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at survivorship movements over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to cut off fawn production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the peak of our sterilization project,
we had 95% of the deer on campus
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized, female deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would really cut our fawn
numbers down to about nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some control those 26 mark
control those lands north and south of
[SPEAKER_01]: campus that we compare against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we looked at movements and
mortality factors, if you're an urban
[SPEAKER_01]: deer, you essentially die in one or two
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either run in front of a motor vehicle,
no big surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you get into a huntable area and
somebody shoots you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like every other study,
our study was no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our tag collar deer died one of
those two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did population estimation with
infrared triggered cameras over bait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer come in, take their own picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we've got them all tagged or
high proportion tagged, we can do mark
[SPEAKER_01]: recapture simulation and modeling and
actually get very reliable estimates of
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance in the sterilization zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a controlled hunting program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the first few years of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay Boolanger worked closely with me on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took a pile of deer off those red
zones for seven years of the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We removed over 700 deer from those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took 700 deer off campus lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sterilized 95% of our doves.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just stand a moment what we had to do
to really get aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our hunting program has been very
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide a lot of recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hunting alone has not achieved our
management goal even though we've taken
[SPEAKER_01]: over 700 deer through legal hunting means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Baron Blasi has set an oak seedling
project on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puts out paired northern red oaks that are
raised in greenhouses, 20 caged,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 uncaged and tagged in plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at survivors as an indicator of
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know deer like the oaks to biodiversity
and deer impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the ways we measure if our
program's having any success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's one of the plots at the Cornell
Golf Course not far from, a five minute
[SPEAKER_01]: walk from where you're going on Bluegrass
Lane this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what our oak survivorship is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dismal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't grown oaks and maples on this
campus in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just too many deer in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, we're trying to get some way
to impact this and turn this around so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can sustain our natural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: On campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we finally decided we're gonna get real
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunting is not working, sterilization is
not working, not working combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's apply to DEC for a damage permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The damage permit provides access to deer
and non-hunting areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get closer into campus and
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hand screen and select shooters and
they have to pass a proficiency test being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to take deer at night with a bow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes a little bit of practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not your average hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analyst deer only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our permit allows us to use bait at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use lights, artificial lighting on
our bows till 11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have campus police approved use of
crossbows and vertical compound bows on
[SPEAKER_01]: campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those had different discharge
distances under New York State regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to follow all the discharge
distances, 250 feet from buildings for
[SPEAKER_01]: crossbows, 150 feet for vertical bows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our limit of deer is based on the number
of DEC tags issued in each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've issued us 40 for the first couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took 34 deer on those 40 permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly after dark, I think only one was
during normal hunting hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then following year 2014, 50,
we took 37 on our 40 tag at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here are the population data I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's all our hunting and sterilization
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what deer are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the first two years of damage
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the herd in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is you gotta go to where the
deer are and you gotta have the most
[SPEAKER_01]: skilled people doing the job right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want crippling loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those deer are very smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason hunters don't take them,
they go nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know when it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can go out there at night with
lights and special equipment on bows and
[SPEAKER_01]: take those deer when they feel safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get into areas that hunters
can't access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what caused that difference
over the two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of urban deer management challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most of these programs are very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta be concerned with public safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine having firearms in the bows around
a campus like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked very closely with Cornell
Police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public values are one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did some capture and euthanization
under our DEC permit, our animal welfare
[SPEAKER_01]: groups went berserk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our university president got 10,000 emails
in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to shut our program down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, you've gotta work with
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had our communication plan all set
up in case that occurred and we weathered
[SPEAKER_01]: the storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our program continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta have access to deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't get to the deer where they're
at, you're gonna do no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means working with private
landowners, working with public
[SPEAKER_01]: landowners, working again with police to
get the access to the points that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta follow all state laws and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discharge distances are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Setting reasonable goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal was important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found, our goal when we started
this project, thinking that by hunting and
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilization, we were gonna reduce deer
abundance by 75% in five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never even got close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just how resilient these
animals are until you work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't understand that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta be working very closely with
police agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want more details, we put an extension
booklet together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free PDFs available online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the wildlifecontrol.info
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of fact sheets in PDF
format for a variety of urban wildlife
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our deer reports there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Info on ongoing research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd save a little paper and
folks can go to the website and download
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want in PDF format.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, probably we're running a little
bit behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's one or two real quick
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that pairing this with a feed
the hungry program and making a big issue
[SPEAKER_02]: out of turning the meat into food for
people would change some perception from
[SPEAKER_02]: the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, incorporating the
venison donation coalition, feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry, does that change perception?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we've got a program going on in a
village of Cuba Heights just north of
[SPEAKER_01]: campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started there four years ago at 125
deer per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're down to 37.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 37 deer per square mile on a damage
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those deer went to the
venison donation coalition and go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: food bank of the central tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that made a huge difference for a
lot of people and gives us public support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody buys into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still gonna get resistance from
really strong animal welfare advocates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the general public, yeah,
hugely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what happened 23 years ago,
there's several things that have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that deer populations really
started to grow exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what happened, particularly in
these suburban areas that aren't hunted
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily or even hunted at all,
is we got to that critical threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: density that allows the population to go
exponential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we used to have in the 60s and
70s was every three, four years,
[SPEAKER_01]: we get a tough winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What controls deer abundance in the
natural landscape in New York and northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania is winter severity and snow
depth, winter snow depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons that deer
densities are lowest in the Adirondacks
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere in the state, because of the deep
persistent snow that they get up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Average deer density in the Adirondacks
are six to 10 per square mile,
[SPEAKER_01]: not 100 per square mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that long snow duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some deer just don't survive the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their fat reserves won't carry them
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with climate change, we've had decades
a couple decades now, relatively mild
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last winter that was severe enough
here in Ithaca to set deer populations
[SPEAKER_01]: back was the winter of 2002, 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had a winter bad enough to
impact the deer since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is that when you do get a
winter in bad and the deer numbers drop,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when the hunters are out
complaining that deer numbers are down,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the doe tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to build the population back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the time you need to increase the
doe tags and just keep it at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually do some good,
but there's public resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's predators on the landscape very
rarely to predators control prey
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty true in most places with
deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few places in, for example,
in the Adirondacks where you get deep
[SPEAKER_01]: snow, where coyotes, for example,
can have advantage and take a fair number
[SPEAKER_01]: of deer and locally suppress a herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get that situation usually in
southern New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've got healthy coyote
populations and we've got healthy bobcat
[SPEAKER_01]: populations and they're expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we've got healthy deer
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as there's plenty of prey,
the predators do well, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really control the herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't take enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you much.
Thank you, Paul.
