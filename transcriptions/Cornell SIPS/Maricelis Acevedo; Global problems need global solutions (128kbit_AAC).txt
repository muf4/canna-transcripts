[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to understand how to deliver
resistance in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a master's in plant improvement
because I wanted to be able to provide to
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmers good varieties that were
resistant, but I could have not
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplished that if I didn't understand
plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to understand the pathogen side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a master in plant breeding,
get a PhD in plant pathology, bring it
[SPEAKER_02]: together so you can deliver the best to
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how my career started,
working in Puerto Rico, then in Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I started working with the
USDA, I couldn't think of a better system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working on crowned rows of oats,
but then I had to do genetics on oats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to find resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if some of you have worked on oats,
you know how difficult it is to work on
[SPEAKER_02]: oats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was not a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a good training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I went on into
working on standards of wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the story that I'm going to
tell you a little bit about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to start under this premise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why what we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant protection in general and the
protection of plants, plant diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: and pests is essential for food security.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, we don't see it that
way, or the media doesn't portray it that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, we have done research for so
many years trying to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 20th century, that's what we focus
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we're going to feed the world,
that's how we're going to produce more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times, we forget that we're
already producing quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're losing a lot to pathogens and
pests in the field, after harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: and not only in quantity, but also in
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can try to retain that loss,
maybe the job is not so tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that feeding the world is not
new news.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been portrayed since the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that there was a large population
that we needed to feed in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're facing having to produce
more food than ever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to increase our production by 70%
to be able to feed 9 billion people by
[SPEAKER_02]: 2050.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the challenge right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to take a multi-facet approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot only look at it from the
production side, but also in the
[SPEAKER_02]: protection of our yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, I find that when
[SPEAKER_02]: we think about food security, we need to
look at the components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look at first,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to look at production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's availability is what we're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Production and also how we storage,
how we reserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look also into how we can
afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we access that food?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be physically, like in the
market, be able to go to the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also having the money to buy the food,
be able to afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our accessibility to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, it's also how we utilize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about nutrition,
but also we're talking about safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know about toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know about post-harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to talk about how to utilize it
better, a balanced diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So food security requires different
components, and we need to take that into
[SPEAKER_02]: account when we do research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we fixing up in this big
picture?
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of you are probably aware that we
eat a lot of wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world eats a lot of wheat,
but we provide 20 to 30% of the proteins
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many parts of the world,
it also accounts for up to a third of the
[SPEAKER_02]: calories that I consume on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us here in the IUS, wheat may be a
piece of bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be cookies in the cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in many parts of the world,
it is what you get every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what is the basis of your diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to take that into consideration
when we talk about food security.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wheat is not the only crop that we need
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to protect our legumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to protect many other sources of
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wheat is essential in that balanced
diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think I need to explain too
much, but we know about stem roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what happened in the IUS.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know about barbaric eradication that
started in 1917.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over 8 million bushes of libraries
were eliminated, eradicated from the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't an easy task, but it was
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a perfect example of how can
human can change the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in a very radical way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We changed the entire population of a
pathogen by removing the sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: reproduction in many parts of the world,
in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are still barbaric cells there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that in the Pacific Islands,
we have a population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have seen the devastation that can
cause, for example, in a specific year,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a specific location, for example,
on barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know there are still races of the stem
roast pathogen coming out of that sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: population that has affected barley
production recently in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even after the barbaric eradication,
there were still epidemics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the solution was not complete,
but it helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now we're going from seeing dozens
of races every year to see more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: one race every year in that US.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the dominant race in that US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we can do, for example,
if we intervene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not possible everywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a solution that it was OK to do,
and it was able to manage the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we didn't control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We managed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in a particular location.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not an approach that we can take
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought we put it to rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the 50s, we didn't see major
epidemics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in 1998, William Gorey in Uganda
identified the first few postures of UG99,
[SPEAKER_02]: the new race of the stem roast pathogen,
that it was not supposed to be that these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties were resistant, had been
resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knew something wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after verification with other
laboratories, because there was only a few
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories that can do the race analysis
that was necessary to confirm the
[SPEAKER_02]: virulence of this pathogen, then it was
confirmed that, yes, it was a new race of
[SPEAKER_02]: stem roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had virulence on not only SR31,
but it was instrumental on the development
[SPEAKER_02]: of varieties for the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was also virulence on many other
genes that were deployed around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the news was starting to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The threat was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got the attention of the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got the attention of sponsors,
investors, like the Vilama Indagay
[SPEAKER_02]: Foundation and the UK Department for
International Development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we then decided to build a coalition
of scientists that could go forward and
[SPEAKER_02]: manage this threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the meantime, I was at the USDA in
Idaho working on oats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks to the Durable Roast Resistant
Inuit Project, there was an opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: for a postdoc position in Idaho to work on
stem roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was asked if I wanted to be part of
the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to take the task and to start
to grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And start working with a new disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shortly after, I went to Kenya and
started evaluating materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look at non-races that could harbor
new resistance to UG99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was during that period of time that
then I was offered the opportunity to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after one year of being working on the
stem roast, and starting to collaborate
[SPEAKER_02]: with the international community,
then I had a new task that it was to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop my own research program at North
Dakota State University to tackle this
[SPEAKER_02]: same problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were concerned about UG99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they got a position that,
like one of those was just that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: see anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mandate was work on rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the mandate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can I not take the chance and say,
hey, let's see what we can do and see now
[SPEAKER_02]: with the network of people that I have not
only in the U.S., but across the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's be part of that community and try to
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I developed my program then at NDSU.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know they needed it because wheat
in North Dakota is almost a two billion
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably underestimating how
wheat affects other areas, not only of
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, but the economy in general of
the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on his research, based
historical evidence, they needed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: worried because yes, they didn't have
epidemics of a stem roast in the near past
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have been able to manage the
different races and we have been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: put varieties that have resistance,
but they had the environment for the
[SPEAKER_02]: disease development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even after the eradication of the
barberries, North Dakota saw 56% yield
[SPEAKER_02]: losses in 1935.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they knew that if the UG99 or any other
races that were as virulent got to that U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S., North Dakota would be in big trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it made a lot of sense to develop a
program to tackle these problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the work that I started at the
USDA identifying other races that had
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance, then I was able to start my
project in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was to use these two land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is from Iran.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has really good resistance in
Kenya.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this other Montenegro land race
that has also good resistance over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the first project that I
started developing with my first PhD
[SPEAKER_02]: student in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Jason was able to map this
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We identified that the inheritance was
conferred by one gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a good project for a
survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's map the gene and try to determine if
this is a new gene or if it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: underutilized so we can start
incorporating and broaden the resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: base of our varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after a couple of years and a lot of
investment into developing, mapping
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, developing new markers that
at that point were not totally accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: because this way with the SNP shifts were
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able then to not only find the
chromosomal location of these genes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also this gene, but also map it,
do a high density map that would allow us
[SPEAKER_02]: to identify good genetic markers that can
be used to in progress this resistance and
[SPEAKER_02]: to utilize it in variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we were able to,
more resources were coming into we.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we were able to identify some
potential genes that can be, that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the region and that could be the actual
gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're MDS LLR type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this moment we are still trying to
figure out because for those of you that
[SPEAKER_02]: have not worked on a hexaploid crop,
it seems straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have five Gs, Candida G.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be able to go in and identify
this gene and that is not the case with we
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have so many repetitive units
and you have duplications of the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time you're trying to map it in
the B genome, then you find it again in
[SPEAKER_02]: the D genome and you're like, okay,
so what I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been really a growing experience,
a learning experience for me and for my
[SPEAKER_02]: student.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we weren't worrying about trying
to clone the gene because that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: golden child was to try to clone this
gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eugene-99 had started changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we were not dealing with one or two
rays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were working out at this moment with 13
different variants and our great gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was effective to some of them,
but not to all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the work wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to find more resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start working then with addition and
looking for new sources of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second choice that was that Montenegro
land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: That land race seemed really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested again 20 races, North American
races and the variants that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible from the East Africa lineage
and it was resistant to all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, this is the one, we'll go
after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started doing the mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found is that it was not
normally distributed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at the population,
so we were like, okay, this is not looking
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's multiple genes that we're dealing
with now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that there was transgressive
segregants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we started doing the mapping,
we have lots of genes or at least QTLs in
[SPEAKER_02]: this background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it made it really difficult because
some of these genes, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: like SR12 is not effective against
Eugene-99.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our gene is right underneath SR12.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or we have a different allele of SR12,
but there's another gene in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we don't have a genome of
which, there's a lot that we don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening in that particular
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just to show you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find multiple QTLs in the chromosome
C and D, 6D, 7D, in 3B, and it continues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have around five different QTLs
within a inheritance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was not Mendelian.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quantitative, but it is a great
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not ready to give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it in the field side by side with
our checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our line has zero, no disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly immune every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on, we need to get to the
bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is challenging, but I think that's
what we do sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to know why, how we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it keeps us interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, in addition, when we look at the
different QTLs, they have an additive
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know we cannot just bring one of the
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to bring multiple QTLs or genes
into this packet if we want to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: level of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you that do genetics and
breeding, then you know what the task is
[SPEAKER_02]: set in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be able to bring all these
genes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about one trait,
and breeders have to worry about how many.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes it really interesting and
challenging, but I think it's all worth it
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know what will happen if we
don't do the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another project that I was involved,
more on the pathogen side, was looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: the population of Uxenia triticina.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not stem cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now talking about lipras.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was kind of a personal,
a very personal project because I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to just work on stem cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody was working on stem cells
because it was needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I needed my own little side project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't give it to my student.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to work on it myself on my spare
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time I went to Kenya and
Ethiopia, I took samples of the pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: that I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a permit so I can bring Uxenia
triticina to the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And working with Jim Colmer in the USDA,
we were able to look at the diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on previous report from Jim's
work, we knew that there was a unique
[SPEAKER_02]: population of the Uxenia triticina
pathogen in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that has never been observed
anywhere else in the world and we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we started looking at,
these isolates, the first thing that we
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed is that they are not virulent on
the differential set that we use for
[SPEAKER_02]: classification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's like, okay, so what do we do
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it on the differential set and it
doesn't grow on the differential set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of give it a raised number,
a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what is the virulence
complexity of this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that we see it every year on
durum wheat, the tetrapoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hexapoy that is our bread wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on the pasta wheat and emmer wheat
that are also tetrapoids in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found similar pockets of
populations in North Africa and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mediterranean region, but nothing like we
saw in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the ongoing projects,
kind of, again, my side projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: just something to play with, where we can
still try to figure out what's going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is so unique about Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Ethiopia, there is a lot of tetrapoids
that has been there for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these populations have evolved in
isolation from other, we don't see these
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrapoids being grown as a crop in other
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Ethiopia, they are up to 7% of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a unique population there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will continue working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention just this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to 3DC, now there's another
leafless pathogen that have never been
[SPEAKER_02]: given much importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Puxinia durian, 3DC durian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it only grows on durum and has
been observed in North Africa,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Morocco, in southern Spain,
in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have the same alternate
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an alternate host that is called
Enchusitalia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wheat here, next to the wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in Morocco visiting one of our
collaborators, and we were looking at leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were in the field, and I just see
the wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what's happening here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know the alternate host for this
other leaf grass continent is present in
[SPEAKER_02]: the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the significance of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know it's part of the
epidemiology of that disease there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what role it plays at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking back in the literature,
there is evidence that this pathogen could
[SPEAKER_02]: be a bridge for having recombination
between 3DC and durian.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a potential for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, we have a lot of other wild
relatives of wheat in the region that we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't looked at yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they reservoirs of these other
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could play a role of what the
virulence that we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of questions out
there that have not been answered yet in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would think that by now, we have
studied rust so much, and we will have all
[SPEAKER_02]: the answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that not only for job security,
but also because we know there is a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it tells us is that there's also
a lot of potential solutions out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are not aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the better we understand the
system, the better we can manage it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have preliminary results of the work
where we see the ophian isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the red wheat, the hexafloid
wheat isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're here and here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from Kenya, you can see isolates
also from red wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you look at what is these
E-races.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the ones that don't grow on the
differential set.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the ones that are coming from
emmer wheat and from durum wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're up here on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are even different than other
durum isolates that actually grow on the
[SPEAKER_02]: differential set.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are what we call the B-races that
are highly inherited on the leaf-rust
[SPEAKER_02]: genes that are present on common wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are very, very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the evolution of these
isolates?
[SPEAKER_02]: How they got to be in Ethiopia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why we haven't observed them anywhere else
in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is there resistance there that we
have not explored in Ethiopia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only to these races.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to other races that not only have used
in durum wheat, but can be utilized maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: in hexafloid wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the isolates that grow on durum
don't grow well on the hexafloid wheat,
[SPEAKER_02]: the red wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the isolates that are virulent on the
hexafloid wheat are not virulent on the
[SPEAKER_02]: durum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a beautiful co-evolution study
that I think is worth investing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: To determine if there's resistance that we
have overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a new path that we can explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So science, it was a lot of fun working in
North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having my own research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having my own greenhouses and the grad
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a larger goal for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers were still the main goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get into the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out to the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making those varieties available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great mapping those genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to try to clone the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that gene stays in a shell,
it doesn't do any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can invest all the time and effort and
money in that research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't make it to the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how I'm going to utilize those genes
that are present in that Montenegrin land
[SPEAKER_02]: race.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I bring them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the resistance that it's affecting
only to few races can be combined with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the resistance that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then get it to the field so we can
feed the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I ended up Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew that I could count on a
great coalition of scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great community of scientists that was
calling to action by Dr. Norman Borlick in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he saw the threat of UG99,
he knew what needed to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sounded the alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great to know that I was not
alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there was a group of scientists that
could use the expertise I have developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also that I can collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took the role of coming to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started working on building on what
was built on the durable roster system
[SPEAKER_02]: project from 2008 on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the durable roster system project
did was to use a multifaceted approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage stem rust, specifically UG99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they look at understanding the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the alternate host.
[SPEAKER_02]: New gene discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was key part of the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also developing markers for those
genes so we can better utilize them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also look at the non-host resistance to
see if there was anything there that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can utilize again to try to manage the
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we don't do the breeding
aspect, again, it just stays on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays on journal articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't make it to the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we needed seed multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capacity building was what I think is very
unique about this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it took into account not only the
scientific component, but the social
[SPEAKER_02]: component.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we develop a new generation of
scientists that can take the job for the
[SPEAKER_02]: next decades?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when UG99 came up, there was only
few people in the world that knew about
[SPEAKER_02]: stem rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have seen a stem rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they knew what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we needed to develop this new
generation of scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the world has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that gender in science was
something that needed to be talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needed to be approached from a very
scientific point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, we need to bring together the
best of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be very concerned about
leaving people behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could bring in lots of great ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And should be respected equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took into this multi-faceted
approach to really deal with the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was really what attracted
me to this position.
[SPEAKER_02]: To know that I have access to this
fantastic network of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the partnership that was
developed during the Grevo-Rossford Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Study Week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you see, it's a global partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's one of the strengths of
this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have experts around the world
with different life experiences,
[SPEAKER_02]: with different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Backgrounds in genetics, in plant
breeding, in plant pathology, social
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have laboratories that could take
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laboratories that were very rudimentary,
but didn't have the passion to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only needed the training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So building on that is where the new
project that Delivery and Genetic A&E Week
[SPEAKER_02]: comes about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was launched in March.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I joined the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, my responsibility is to
manage the scientific components of this
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bringing some leadership and some
help to the scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to provide for that community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to communicate between the
different groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have competitive efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will utilize the resources the best
that we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, come up with new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I talk to somebody in one laboratory
and see that they should connect to
[SPEAKER_02]: another laboratory, I can bring those
collaborations together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, having a background
in growth pathology kind of helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how the project looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started in 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first phase of the robot
research at Delivery and Genetic A&E Week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's where we are with DGGW.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the main objectives of the
project, that is to modernize reading
[SPEAKER_02]: programs at SEMED and national programs in
Ethiopia and South Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also, we're looking at surveillance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at how the pathogen change
move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we predict it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we put additional models out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that we can say, oh yeah,
this is a new race, or the race that
[SPEAKER_02]: showed up last year was this race.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't want to do it looking
backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it to look forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we predict when we're going to see the
next epidemic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we determine what races have the best
chances of moving to a different location?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to continue in human
capacity building.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the approach that we're taking
similar as before, putting more effort
[SPEAKER_02]: into, again, the surveillance.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the, we're using the phenotyping
platform that is where we use our field
[SPEAKER_02]: plots in Kenya and Ethiopia to be able to
screen as many materials from around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world so we can move forward faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, we're using new technologies
because we're looking at rust.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at how can we deliver a
better pattern?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we, so resistance is one trait,
but we need to look at yield, we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at quality, we need to look at
climate and changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have to grow more wheat and less
space under less resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we find better drought tolerant,
wheat varieties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make that part of the packet?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're working with our
teams at CEME and national programs around
[SPEAKER_02]: the world to try to identify not only
resistant to rust, which is notorious,
[SPEAKER_02]: another area that we're looking at,
but also looking at wheat in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I mentioned, we were expanding our
surveillance.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the project started in 2008,
there were just a couple of laboratories
[SPEAKER_02]: that can handle race identification and
only few groups were sharing data on the
[SPEAKER_02]: races that they were observing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have many countries collaborating
and bringing data every year so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: track the pathogen better and also predict
where we may observe in the next season.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are continuing our breeding efforts and
expanding on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the efforts that were developed before,
we're going to bring new technology like
[SPEAKER_02]: the selection and hydropathy of typing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this brings using new technology,
the best of the best that is out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop new systems to do the work
better, more efficient, to deliver genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: gain, to increase the rate of genetic gain
in wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue using our
phenotopic platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we call the phenotopic platforms
are very large field plots in different
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the world that are hotspots for
specific traits or like in the case of
[SPEAKER_02]: rust, Eustania, Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're using also Ethiopia for
Sectoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also CEME is looking into finding
additional platforms that they can utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: for drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in Mexico right now,
they're using changing the planting time
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to get drought and heat tests
for tolerance of heat and drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue our advocacy and
this is something that is getting
[SPEAKER_02]: overlooked so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The importance of communicating the
science, not only to the media,
[SPEAKER_02]: the public, but policymakers,
understanding the value of really getting
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based information out there to
remove the misinformation and the fears
[SPEAKER_02]: that the public and the media and even
other scientists have about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in our part of the world in case
of technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, breeding aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And should we interfere, should we
intervene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we do things differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: So advocacy is key, not only for
communicating the science, but also to
[SPEAKER_02]: attract additional funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know, I'm sure you're all aware,
how difficult it is to find funding for
[SPEAKER_02]: public goods these days and to continue
that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires communication and
communicating effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to continue our talent
pipeline with doing training of junior
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be short and long-term
trainings, include some week training or
[SPEAKER_02]: sending somebody for a PhD abroad and also
trying to maintain the knowledge in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to decoy the countries of
their smartest people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to grow back and have a place
in that community and in their country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try to encourage that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we will continue also advocating
for those, rewarding those mentors that
[SPEAKER_02]: mentor females and minorities and do a
great job of recognizing that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: should have a place in science and
contribute to science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do data management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about big data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about having drones taking
data out there in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to process the data?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the bottleneck was like,
I kind of walk fast enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that many hours in the day to
collect my data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can collect the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do once we get the data in?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that there's a bottleneck
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking for better ways to manage
the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also how to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are big on open access and that science
needs to be collaborative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you kind of work in isolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the key components of our
project is that every publication that is
[SPEAKER_02]: the result of our project is going to be
published in open access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's thanks to the support from our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a small part on seed
production in Nepal because of the need
[SPEAKER_02]: after the earthquake.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there is a really big gap and
we can use this as an opportunity to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: how to develop a small seed system that
could be utilized as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're developing other systems in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it from our headquarters here at
Cornell because we know that we are very
[SPEAKER_02]: well placed and respected in the world to
do a great job bringing science and the
[SPEAKER_02]: sciences and the public together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a lot of trust built in this
university from the part of the public,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also from our investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are very well placed to collaborate
with others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the goal is to take it to the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
We
have some questions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that I'm back on my defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been asked that in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about durability of the
system, we talk about over time but also
[SPEAKER_02]: over acreages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So durable rusting system is something
difficult to define just because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: only really look at it when you look
backwards, like how long it lasted,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was established.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that there are some key
components that seem to be correlating
[SPEAKER_02]: with durability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about not putting high
selection pressure on the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pathogen doesn't evolve as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, using slow rusting genes
seem to be associated with durability.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, not in all the cases,
but in some cases we have seen that there
[SPEAKER_02]: is some correlation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that some genes that have
lasted for a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the SR31, was any progression from a
different species to each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some key components that we
don't understand clearly yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also some dangers when we
start swapping genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to make the system more
easier to evolve?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pathogen now can go into other
crops that it was not a host in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not seen that necessarily with our
rust, but we know that could be a chance
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of durability, we're trying
to find ways to stack more genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at durability,
like if we put three to five genes
[SPEAKER_02]: together, are we talking about that the
pathogen needs to mutate four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: times to be able to overcome the
resistance in that particular variety?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we reduce the amount of inoculum,
because the pathogen kind of grew on this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant enough, we are reducing the inoculum
that is there, the mutation rate is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the chances of one billion spores
versus two billion spores, maybe we reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: the chance of amputation that can overcome
a particular resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that durability has to be
looked from different aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the host side, but also what it's
doing on the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of answers your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're always excited what's new in
the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of things on that
surveillance aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the surveillance is sampling more,
but also have better sources in the
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypic side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can we identify markers that would tell
us if it's a UG99 or it's not a UG99?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have that in place that at least
can tell us the group type.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not been able to develop racist
specific markers yet, but we can tell that
[SPEAKER_02]: it belongs to the lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is part that gets incorporated as
soon as samples are collected,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're saying, to Minnesota or to
Denmark, and they can be evaluated that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope that we can do more on that and
get faster responses so we know what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also using more technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farmer or the researcher that is in
the field can identify, is it stem rust,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it leaf rust, is it yellow rust,
kind of loaded, can tell you the
[SPEAKER_02]: coordinates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we see that it's a hotspot,
and with the modeling that we have in
[SPEAKER_02]: place, can we say, you need to go and
spread in the next region?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because based on our wind pattern and
weather and the information that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: in hand, you are next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're doing with
surveillance, trying to develop an early
[SPEAKER_02]: warning system that can be incorporated.
So you have different components.
Sort of connected with Becca's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was always a lot of concern
when it got into Iran.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after the initial confirmation
of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: 999 in Yale, we haven't seen new races
coming out of the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be many races whether,
you know, our disease triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't need to explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like, well, how are we going?
[SPEAKER_02]: The disease triangle goes this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know why that is, but we have
not observed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like that made a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the, first let's look at the
country situations in Kenya, in Ethiopia,
[SPEAKER_02]: in many areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this Africa, wheat is planted all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one cistern after another after
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know there is a great bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you're harvesting one,
the other one is already in the seedling
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the crops can always survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always have to hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: 999 per se is just a combination of
virulence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the key virulence that we had
was SR-31.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that SR-31 has been deployed
around the world in many varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So selection pressure was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, you know, the first
evidence of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: 999 in East Africa came around that time,
1998, when they looked back at records.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that it was there before,
but a very, very low frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, with agriculture,
we have probably selected for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the challenge is that there's always,
in Afghanistan, there's always hope in the
U.S.
999.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing all these new variants in
the region because the pathogen can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: mutating, and you have all this inoculum
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so if the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: 999 has been picked up on barberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's barberries in the region,
in Kenya, in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the species can, is a host of
Hustania grama.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that if it's, if I don't think,
have been confirmed that that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: race is on the barberries, but we know the
barberries are in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know all the role that the
barberry may play because it's in a high
[SPEAKER_02]: altitude, but it's definitely there in the
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the, this is the beautiful thing
of working with people that know the
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, and know pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I normally work with breeders,
so it's a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we have to explain a lot, but you have
the right questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seedling test for the wheat stem grass
works really well for most of our all
[SPEAKER_02]: stages of genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if genes that are affected by the
seedling so far are affected by the adult
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's genes that are in the adult
plant stage that are not evident at the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those we cannot detect at the seedling
stage because the plants look susceptible,
[SPEAKER_02]: but once you put it in the field,
then you have your field resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use both.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the seedling test to detect the old
stage resistant genes that are normally
[SPEAKER_02]: racist specific, and then we work with the
adult plant genes that are some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: slow-grossing that I was talking before
that tend to be not racist specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a broad spectrum of resistance,
and so then we look at the latency period
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of them need to be used in
combination, but the seedling test is
[SPEAKER_02]: really helpful for numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to eliminate a lot of
materials, but definitely some materials
[SPEAKER_02]: that are susceptible to the seedling stage
will be resistant at the adult plant
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is about the technology
that we're using, like some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotyping and the genotyping is expected
to be spread across every laboratory of
[SPEAKER_02]: their specific centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have centers that are doing the
research, and we have, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: genotyping laboratories that are accessing
genotyping samples so people can send
[SPEAKER_02]: their samples in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we support some of the USDA
laboratories or a laboratory in Denmark
[SPEAKER_02]: and in Canada that can do the genotyping
for us, and we are offering the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity of training for junior
scientists because many countries want to
[SPEAKER_02]: modernize their agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethiopia is one of those countries that is
really looking forward to modernizing the
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, and so they have one
molecular biology experience, so we're
[SPEAKER_02]: offering the training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the opportunity is there for them,
they're welcome to do it via our
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you again, Maricelis,
for an excellent seminar, and Maricelis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would like closer ties with the
botanologist here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maricelis has offered to have meetings
with anybody interested in getting to know
[SPEAKER_01]: her a little better, and just simply send
her an email here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you again very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Maricelis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
