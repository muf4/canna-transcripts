[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Martha Williams,
and I'm studying plant science in the
[SPEAKER_00]: School of Integrative Plant Sciences
because I love connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I was a little girl,
I used to see how the plants in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: became the food that was on my dinner
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've grown older, I've realized
that plants not only feed the body but
[SPEAKER_00]: nourish the soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bridge this gap that we have between
the technological world we've created and
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural world from which we have
distanced ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They build community.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I had the opportunity this
summer to work with a handful of children
[SPEAKER_00]: who worked to plant a garden, plant this
garden, and maintain this garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched how amazed they were,
the same that they look at their
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, looking at the plants that
they were growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw how in awe they were that their
hands were able to create an edible
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, that they were able to tell how
these plants had nourished them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope at my time here at Cornell that
I continue to build these connections
[SPEAKER_00]: because these connections aren't singular
to young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shared between people of all age
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to not only build these
connections but build community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

Thank you.
