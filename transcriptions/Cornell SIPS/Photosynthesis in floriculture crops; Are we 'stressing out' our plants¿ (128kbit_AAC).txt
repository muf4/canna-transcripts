[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk a little fast,
because there's a lot of stuff I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the state of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only place to elect a professional
wrestler as governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many places do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things about Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second largest variation in temperature in
the continental US.
[SPEAKER_01]: 38C to minus 53C.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90,000 miles of shoreline, more than
California, Florida, Hawaii, and combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure every puddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest population of people of
Scandinavian, Somalian, Hmong descent
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of those countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are somewhat diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the great University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: 55,000 undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home of Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honeycrisp apples from Jim Looby in my
department.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something happened.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where they discovered the pacemaker,
which is that strange machine down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medtronic spinoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largest city is the city of Minneapolis,
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Minneapolis has a park board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm chair of the park board.
[SPEAKER_01]: The park board existed before the city of
Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I help run a park system with 183
parks and 50 recreation centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,800 kids sports teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own police force, which is
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: 6,732 acres of land and natural air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about that now,
but I do know there are some people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are interested in urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm instead going to talk about plants and
stresses in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some changes that have happened since
the 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did it even get into this area?
[SPEAKER_01]: The crops we grow in the 60s, which is the
last time a lot of work in CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis, and some of that work in
floriculture was done, has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry was cut flowers and potted
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the industry is based on bedding
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of species we grow has
increased dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy costs have increased, and profit
margins have decreased dramatically in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have HBS and LED lighting,
which was not as commonplace back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have shade curtains and
environmental control computers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't have information to put in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And temperature and CO2 levels have
increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in graduate school with Marvin,
the standard was 333 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's 388.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is little to no information on
lighting temperature and CO2 standards for
[SPEAKER_01]: the current crops we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the geraniums we grow now are
different than the geraniums that were
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have any information to
utilize this fantastic equipment that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have that run our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to talk about a little bit how
we stress our plants out on a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: basis and often don't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have cool season crops and warm season
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a relative growth rate curve
of two kinds of turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But notice with cool season crops,
and I'll show you data to this effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 degrees, there's a maximum C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice above 20 degrees, you actually
start having a decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll start showing that with
photosynthesis and development rate on
[SPEAKER_01]: some common crops we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we stress our plants out commonly
and have no appreciation that we are in
[SPEAKER_01]: fact doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show some evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Neil mentioned, I'm going to talk about
light temperature and CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I work in a variety of other
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to give you a little bit
of an idea what some of those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some data of the average daily
light integral or moles of light per day
[SPEAKER_01]: in January throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that you as Minnesota is
at two to four and at most six moles of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are parts of the United States
that benefit greatly from adding
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that Cornell is in there
as well as Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we do light, there's some
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have a graph of daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is cutting yield per pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is for taking cuttings off of a
pot, stock plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see that as the daily light
integral goes up, the cutting yield goes
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can also see with two different
levels of CO2, the yield goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in generally, yield of any crop,
be it tomatoes, greenhouse peppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuce dry weight, proportionally
increases with photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a picture from Neil,
I think, isn't it, Neil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You recognize that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neil took this picture a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this purple wave petunia with
night interruption lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is supplemented with 150
micromole of additional high HPS light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just to demonstrate both of
these have long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But which one flowers quicker,
the one with the higher light level or
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a standard photosynthesis curve
that's been used for ever in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically shows that as absorbed light
or PAR goes up, CO2 assimilation goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some region that's typically in
the winter in our area where plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: light limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get up to a certain level,
which is typically around 400 to 600
[SPEAKER_01]: micromole, saturation occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant photosynthesis is CO2
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started collecting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a Lightcore 6400.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did 25 different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have huge data sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to show you some brief ones
to make some points.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that in patients, as PAR goes
up, PN goes up until you reach
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately 400 micromole of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you'll see some standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we take five different
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one is five separate curves from
five separate leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's replicated again three
times over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: One horizontal leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a Lightcore 6400, which clamps
right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll come back to something related to
that question a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from a tomato grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is bushel boy tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these represents a different
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to show that within a species,
even within a single greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have very different rates of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have saturation occurring at
different spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 750 micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's higher than the impasse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So notice that this particular cultivar
was still increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's dramatically different
responses to increasing light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suggesting that even within the same
greenhouse, there should be different
[SPEAKER_01]: light management strategies based on the
cultivar that's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we looked at some leaf
filtering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has not been considered,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's coleus and here's panicum,
a grass and a coleus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just measured light intensity
as you move down through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing that you have significant
filtering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these plants were just barely
touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this just goes to show you that only
60% of the incident light in a coleus
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy actually gets to the middle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you get to the bottom of
the plant, you're down to 18% of radiance
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually can penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, of course, with the grass,
it's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% and 55%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these shade curtain systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have them in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we decide when to close the
shade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who decides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill, who decides?
[SPEAKER_01]: You divine it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We divine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no information with which to use
to identify when we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll tell you that most greenhouses
use a standard of 3,000 to 4,000 foot
[SPEAKER_01]: candles, which is comparable to around 600
to 800 micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the shade system starts closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in our systems that we have,
if you go out to your greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: the light sensors that control the shade
system, where are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on a weather station that's
outside of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, only 60% of incident light
enters the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have single pane glass in a
lot of your greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most places have exolite, or double poly,
or another kind of poly that diffuses the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yours is actually better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shade cloth systems, typically the
standard shade cloth is 55% light
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction curtain that comes across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, if you use a typical shade
system with 55% when it closes at 600
[SPEAKER_01]: micromole of light, the radiance of the
top of the canopy after getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and going through a shade
system is all the way reduced to 198
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to the middle of the plant,
in a typical coleus canopy, you're all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down to a third of the actual light
that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: To look at an impatience curve at 600,
this is where you're at getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and the shade cloth system
closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is halfway down on the
canopy, down to 119.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've reduced your photosynthesis in that
particular instance from close to seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way down to just above two.
[SPEAKER_01]: A third of the photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've effectively starved your plant at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And greenhouses are routinely doing this,
that they're overshading all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is creating significant problems
that they're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, in a cut rose greenhouse
or a greenhouse tomato facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have more blind shoots in those
facilities with roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have less fertile flowers with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole problem was because of the
shade system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they weren't using good numbers on
the shade system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The solution, first of all, is quite
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the meter that runs the system,
take it off the top of the pole outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse, and move it into the
greenhouse, into the middle of the canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not simply reset the figure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reset the figure?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sun comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up here, it comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Minneapolis, it gets up 23 degrees
above the horizon on Christmas,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then goes back down again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the light barely comes up like that,
more skips off the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, what gets in the
greenhouse changes depending on the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simply the best thing is just put it in
the greenhouse, which none of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse companies do and which
absolutely would be the best thing for all
[SPEAKER_01]: of you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then run the shade system off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works for any greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of a single greenhouse in the
United States that has a light sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in topics of temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world is a warm place, and it's
getting warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a premise that I work off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in a lot of heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are routinely causing heat stress in
our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of us don't appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now plants naturally try to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll reflect light as best they can in
warm places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we often will stress many of our
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bushel Boy Tomatoes, which is a large,
large greenhouse tomato producer,
[SPEAKER_01]: their lowest yield is the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not what you would expect,
but that's when yield is the lowest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it the lowest?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started this research project,
because of them, it's simply because of
[SPEAKER_01]: heat stress that occurs on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Species differ in the optimal temperature
for photosynthesis, and that optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature can actually change as the
season progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my belief that we're routinely
reducing photosynthesis by growing plants
[SPEAKER_01]: too warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Pandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature C.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three light levels, 300,
600, and 900 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's PN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the Pandy PN is optimal at
20 C.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see that as you go above 20
degrees C, which the greenhouses probably
[SPEAKER_01]: are even today, that photosynthesis starts
to decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if it's in Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's constant 20 C on the left,
and you have 30 C on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty clearly see the 30 C Pandy
has less photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's occurred with that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group of crops that I would say
are mid-range.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Gerbera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it is an optimal
temperature between 20 and 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see a shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So further with Poinsettia, where you'll
have an optimal temperature with
[SPEAKER_01]: Poinsettia around 30 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why we can raise Poinsettia
stock plants in a greenhouse during the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a question we started asking is what
is the justification or cause for these
[SPEAKER_01]: responses, for these curves to shift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the photochemistry should be
essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started looking at the stomates and
just plain old stomatal conductance and
[SPEAKER_01]: stomatal behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you remember the Pandy plot,
this is actually temperature versus
[SPEAKER_01]: stomatal conductance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's quite high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as temperature increased, the stomates
actually closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limitation that occurred with
photosynthesis may be associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: closure of stomates.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at Gerbera, I look at the
stomatal conductance with Gerbera,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see that we also had, here was
around where we had the optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, and then you can see the
decline again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suggesting that frankly if the stomates
close, of course the plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have less photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be part of the justification
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else we looked at is short-term
high temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found was that a short-term,
and by what short-term?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we focus on temperatures that are not
temperatures that people would call heat
[SPEAKER_01]: shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of research on heat shock,
and that typically is at temperatures of
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 to 45 C.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at temperatures that are 30
to 40 that plants see on a very common
[SPEAKER_01]: basis in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we asked the question, if we let the
temperatures heat up to 95 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit for two hours, was there any
impact on a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a graph of PAR on the bottom
versus PN, and you can see the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: curve right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at what happened if the plants
were exposed the two hours at 35 C,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we redid the curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a fully, a 59% reduction in the
maximum photosynthesis the plant could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back in the next day and measured
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were still depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day it came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took three days, three days for the
plant to recover from that single 95
[SPEAKER_01]: degree exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked on some other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is petunia, this is glow lavender
shades.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the same response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Significant depression and three days to
come back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these short term high temperature
exposures can have a long, a three day or
[SPEAKER_01]: more effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers are in fact doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they want to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let their greenhouse temperatures
increase at the end of the day to capture
[SPEAKER_01]: heat and keep the greenhouse closed,
hoping that they'll keep the heat moving
[SPEAKER_01]: into the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Israelis that didn't have done
some work with this actually as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: they did work with field tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the, they saw the midday
depression in photosynthesis that often
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they did is they irrigated the
field tomatoes and cooled the leaves when
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves got really hot at that one time
of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found the significant,
they got a significant increase in yield
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it eliminated the midday depression of
photosynthesis that occurred from that
[SPEAKER_01]: high temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if we could apply some of these
concepts in greenhouses as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: or greenhouse tomato production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially any time the temperature
exceeds the maximum, you should do
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you can to try to reduce the
temperature to the optimal temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention one other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called around and we started looking
for what are their fundamental differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between heat tolerant plants with respect
to flowering and heat intolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is we called companies that
produce flowers, bedding plants of
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds, send us a geranium that's
very heat tolerant and send us a geranium
[SPEAKER_01]: that's very heat intolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did photosynthetic response
curves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in every case, and these are across
companies and across species, in every
[SPEAKER_01]: case, the heat tolerant plant,
which is in red, always had a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic rate than the heat
intolerant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suggesting that there may be some
association with heat tolerance as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it brings to mind, we did some work on
some aerabatopsis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone works on aerabatopsis at one
point or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did is we looked at how
different kinds of heat stresses,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did one hour, two hour, four hour,
eight hour, 16 hour, how these different
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we imposed all different kinds of
stress, because the term stress is a
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult term to define.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because how do we define it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it eight hours at 28 degrees or one
hour at 36 degrees?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is a very strange
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we published this back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we evaluated a number of different
aerabatopsis strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did is we put it onto a degree
day model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data fit almost too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of these situations where the
graduate student comes back and gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: something and you think they had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's moved to points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see these points fit the
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this was was the data suggests
that there was a cumulative effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different stresses with a degree
hour concept over 32 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that for whatever reason, when we
exceeded 225 degree hours over 32 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could see that we went from no
abortion to completely aborting all the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers on aerabatopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't matter how the stresses were
arranged.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, a 38 degree stress for
three hours or 34 degrees for more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the cumulative effect in degree
hours over 32 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taken together, if you look at the
stomatal conduct and stuff we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: it brings to mind a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some plants either produce more ABA,
those plants that were heat sensitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: do they produce more ABA in response to a
chronic high temperature stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they more responsive to the high
temperature stress, to the same endogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: ABA level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the responses we're seeing time
and time again are related to stomatal
[SPEAKER_01]: closure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not any damage to the photosystem in the
temperature range I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can stomatal conductance, after a single
stress, be a way that we can screen for
[SPEAKER_01]: heat tolerance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after heat stress, even a two hour
heat stress, if the stomates are staying
[SPEAKER_01]: open and the plant is still actively
photosynthesizing, it likely is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more heat tolerant than one that is
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a screen protocol that can be
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back and started looking at CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the greenhouses in the United States,
people who have been around for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, there used to be CO2 burners in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got away from them because the burners
would not work properly and they'd release
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene, you'd have disasters,
and so people got away from using CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: burners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go around to greenhouses now in
floriculture, there's next to no CO2 being
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's cyclamen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down here is ambient.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the degree of responsiveness that
you can get on cyclamen by increasing CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's greenhouse tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this particular grower is,
the greenhouse tomato growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse vegetable growers do inject
CO2, typically up to 800 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see, that's here, and some of
these species still would benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, there was huge,
huge responses to CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than what we appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went into the research greenhouses and
looked at what are our CO2 levels on a
[SPEAKER_01]: sunny day in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the meter reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: 193 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: 193 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd the CO2 go?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants used it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new greenhouses we have, we've spent
so much effort and time making them tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the CO2 levels in the greenhouses are
actually significantly depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Significantly depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't even really appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you an idea, this is one hour
under what would be considered low light,
[SPEAKER_01]: medium light, and high light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started at 388, one hour in a low light
greenhouse, the CO2 level dropped to 370.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour in medium light, down to 340.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour in high light, all the way down
to 310 in one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a single hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can tell you, if you have all kinds
of high pressure sodium lights up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: after two, three hours, your plants,
if they're down to 190 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not using all that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're simply wasting the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new open roof greenhouses that people
recognize gives you superior growth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, part of the reason I believe is
frankly, that these have CO2 levels that
[SPEAKER_01]: are similar to ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not CO2 depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The addition of CO2 is the number one most
cost effective way to actually increase
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis in a greenhouse today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take a CO2 sensor and go into a
canopy on a bench, on any of your
[SPEAKER_01]: canopies, you'll check and you'll find
that your CO2 level inside that canopy is
[SPEAKER_01]: often around 200 to 300 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when the greenhouse is venting,
because you get this boundary layer that
[SPEAKER_01]: forms on the bench itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, doing nothing more than
circulating your air at least equalizes
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2 level within the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have depletion within a
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least you'll get up to 380 if you're
bringing in air from outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in our experimental
greenhouses and in our growth chambers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are commonly depleting or growing
plants and depleted CO2 levels that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually dramatically affecting our
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases invalidating them
because the plant may not even be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use the light that you're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or providing in the growth chamber itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switch gears a little bit with succulents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of interest in succulents.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a crown of thorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And succulents respond as other plants to
increasing CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Echeveria and Aeonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: These take up CO2 at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all what we consider to be cam plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually do take up CO2 at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We studied a number of cacti and they're
taking up CO2 during the day in many
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The assumption is that they're only taking
CO2 up at night and that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also orchids, Phalaenopsis orchids,
will take up CO2 during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is Phragmipedium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the beginning of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is CO2 uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see pretty clearly that this
orchid takes up CO2 at night only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suggesting if you're producing this orchid
that you should actually be injecting CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move along quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: High temperature slowing of development
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf unfolding rate, this is an old graph
I've used from African violets,
[SPEAKER_01]: follows this standard line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pretty common curve for lots
of plants we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an optimal temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, leaf unfolding rate often is
optimized right around 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was developed, here's African
violet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see leaf number increasing up to
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see a decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I want to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have decreases this,
for whatever reason, this temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: almost sentinel to lots of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is melon fly egg development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doesn't it look an awful lot like the
graph we just saw?
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point is this, when the temperature
exceeds the optima, which in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: production it commonly does, we actually
slow the rate of leaf unfolding and slow
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop down in its development rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hot temperatures, and right now your
leaf temperatures, remember one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's 85 degrees in the greenhouse,
your leaf temperature is above 90 and
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are actually on the other end of that
curve, and your crop is actually starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take longer to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's underappreciated area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the standard curve, if we go from 85
to 95, that same plant to unfold one leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: will now take five days instead of 3.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've slowed leaf unfolding approximately
by a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to come back again, we have a number of
crops that are down in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have temperatures that are
routinely going from 20 up to 35 C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are routinely decreasing
photosynthesis as part of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're routinely decreasing the leaf
unfolding rate and actually slowing the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop development in that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are routinely closing our stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone was talking about edge burn on
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the high temperature is encouraging
edge burn on lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of understand where that
comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the stomates are closing, of course the
plant is going to have difficulty taking
[SPEAKER_01]: up calcium in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've gone through all different
kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go through this and
identify what happens if you decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures and the timing of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've integrated that into a
package that everyone has access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any of you haven't tried this
program, it's a wonderful program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Virtual Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for modeling crop growth and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally take your greenhouse and
identify how much more it's going to cost
[SPEAKER_01]: if you switch the outer covering on the
greenhouse or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we pull it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing is biotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of us appreciate that when a
plant is attacked, it releases volatiles
[SPEAKER_01]: that go to other plants, sometimes within
the same species, sometimes other species,
[SPEAKER_01]: and tell that plant that it's being
attacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants communicate via volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from data that is not mine from
2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is showing alnus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uninfested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's an alnus that is infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the GC depicting the dramatic
expression and variety of volatiles that
[SPEAKER_01]: are produced after infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also a recent picture just showing
you the degree to the sophistication.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is recent paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the insect lays an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That egg actually produces a compound that
stimulates salicylic acid, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonistic to jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually creates a system where
the plant is not able to defend itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the larvae does hatch,
the plant doesn't know it's being attacked
[SPEAKER_01]: and is defenseless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started looking at what happens if we
expose plants to methyl jasmonate,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the primary volatiles that plants
give off, to warn that an attack has been
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we would treat plants with
methyl jasmonate, and then we would infest
[SPEAKER_01]: them with mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how many mites that have fled
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that in each case,
a plant that was exposed to methyl
[SPEAKER_01]: jasmonate, and this was for a single hour,
resulted in a plant that when you would
[SPEAKER_01]: put mites on it, the mites would flee
compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if we quantified, if we come back to
the tomato, you'll notice the tomato had
[SPEAKER_01]: significant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we quantify protease inhibitors,
which is one of the purported responses
[SPEAKER_01]: that plants have in response to methyl
jasmonate, you'll see that with tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: that as methyl jasmonate concentration
went up, or exposure went up, the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: produced more protease inhibitor in
response to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take that further, this is the
number of mites that were on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: after a period of three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in any case,
whenever there was a plant that was
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to methyl jasmonate, it had fewer
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the same case for aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is after 11 days with aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had methyl salicylate, but notice
methyl jasmonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had eight in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a representation of some of
the work that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, in all the studies we did
after a plant was exposed to methyl
[SPEAKER_01]: jasmonate, it actually proliferated less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did the insects try to flee it,
but they actually proliferated less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, predation of any kind and activation
of plant defenses has a cost for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, when you turn on plant
defenses, that plant will actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: less dry weight than a plant adjacent to
it if the defenses are turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is spending a lot of effort
actually producing compounds to defend
[SPEAKER_01]: itself at the expense of other materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a cost to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that's also very interesting
is that if you look at different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: wounding responses, you'll only see
response to a caterpillar, not a tearing,
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that somehow the plant recognizes a
pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why this is blurred on this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is FAC is actually
caterpillar spit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant actually perceives the saliva
from the caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what causes the chain reaction
and response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the process right now of
actually determining whether plants have
[SPEAKER_01]: vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that the response to a
white fly may be different than an aphid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which may be different than a mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be very brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: New directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of new crop work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives you an idea of some of the
gladiolas that exist in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very little gladiola species in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing work with cactus and
succulents, where we think that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: be new bedding plants or new potted
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been identifying plants and
protocols to get cacti and succulents to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower when we want them to, so you can
have them blooming all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the same with succulents of
different kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we identify protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty clearly see they're what
the foot of period exceeds 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all those species, these are each
calanchos, that they remain vegetative,
[SPEAKER_01]: that if the foot of period is less than 13
hours, they're reproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a large project on green roofs
in the Midwest, because the green roof
[SPEAKER_01]: work that's been done in Baltimore and the
East Coast and Chicago and Toronto doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: apply to the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we screened 78 species over a series of
years and identified what plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: survive on a green roof in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crazy project on grafted cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone say there aren't many grafted
cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of grafted cactus in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these cacti is on a different
rootstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same scion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the effect you see is purely a
rootstock response.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of potential for this as far
as expanding the crop palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some interest in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just mention a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difficult area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked this morning about how you have
to optimize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to optimize the fish number that
will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to optimize how many plants a
fish population can support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the plants grow, the
conditions that you have changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market, people are getting tired
of tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so much tilapia you can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think like we have the Schlitz
Brewery is converting into a giant
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture facility in Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be producing more tilapia
than we know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interest in our growers is frankly in
alternative aquaponic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's an alternative crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's called a red claw,
which it has no red claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a blue claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they call it red claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a large freshwater lobster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a crayfish that gets a
really big tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shrimp, crabs, and freshwater oysters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more interest in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the restaurants in the Minneapolis
area are very interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some that have some of these
crazy systems where there are fish at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is LEDs in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is lettuce in this case,
but actually they've switched to basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this rotates.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question was, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just grow basil in the greenhouse
someplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they effectively do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last picture is this contraption,
which is actually in California from two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone has to identify protocols for
these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Tom and Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tom and Jerry work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't ever smash into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is they're spacing
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those guys will work for six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put a new battery pack in,
and they need to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no overtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no complaints.
[SPEAKER_01]: But someone has to program this thing
about what a plant looks like and what to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a project related to
looking at these little helicopters with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little tank of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the helicopters will fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will recognize an aphid and then
spritz it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the intent is to use it in orchards so
that these things will target the shoe
[SPEAKER_01]: tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Minnesota, none of the water flows
at all just sits like this in these big
[SPEAKER_01]: mosquito pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is land I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I'll answer any questions you
may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to get done by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am done 20 seconds early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of your early slides, you showed
stomatal conductance data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lycor also calculated CI, internal
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are stomates actually optimizing their
conductance to maintain a constant CI so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I wonder about is that
you know that as you increase CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say in a tomato greenhouse or
something, the stomates actually close
[SPEAKER_01]: down in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: That accommodates some of what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know what impact that has on
actual photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still believe that there's a decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the short-term heat stress we saw,
that lag, seems to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some sort of response that a plant
has that some of these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: responding to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume it's ABA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next step would be actually to look
at some mutants, ABA mutants, to look and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what sort of response happens within
those mutants themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as internal CI, we didn't find
the optimization or try to get a constant
[SPEAKER_01]: internal CI.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, we used the Lycor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the differences in the internal CI
explain why you're seeing different light
[SPEAKER_02]: response curves in the same?
Which?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the differences in the internal CI
be explaining why we're getting different
[SPEAKER_02]: light response curves where you have power
versus the PM?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean within the same species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, within the same species,
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you explain that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there clearly is inherent
differences probably from the parentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different pulse bars that impose the
maximum rate that can occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume it's related to the parentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you take a group of species,
you'll find within that group of species,
[SPEAKER_01]: within a genus, that they'll be different,
maximum levels, maximum PM that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's related to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you showed were CO2 responses or
photosynthetic responses that were
[SPEAKER_06]: parallel essentially throughout the
temperature range testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there must be something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just a heat shutdown that was
occurring for the resistant versus the
[SPEAKER_06]: more parallel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there must be some more fundamental
differences, as you just said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Likr, you can set a specific
humidity level and maintain the vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can set it so that it doesn't
confound the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much with the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually accommodates everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also did you measure ABA critical
level?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't measure ABA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The assumption is because we're seeing the
guard cells closure of the stomates at ABA
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow at the bottom of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no evidence to confirm it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also no interaction for K plus and CA
plus plus deficiency or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't look for nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were treated the same when their
responses were, as you saw, almost
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate in some cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another question related to the heat and
shade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes, growers will say, oh,
it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to put the shade in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what you tell them now,
OK, heat is bad, but shade is also bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what should they be doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the tomato greenhouse and the rose
greenhouse, this started with the rose
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We told them to shut the shade system
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they shut the shade system down,
guess what happens to the blind shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage in the summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: It dramatically dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blind shoots, they were having,
they weren't having.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it solved the problem, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't that heat problem with the
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just put it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat problem with the plants wasn't as
bad as the shade problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shade was more limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high temperature reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have rose data, it shows that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the shade, where you saw, I think,
just in the one example with impatience,
[SPEAKER_01]: it dropped likely down to nearly a third.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the period of light exposure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not low light, but high light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Bob Langhans, when he was here,
told me that you have to put the shade
[SPEAKER_05]: over five o'clock on legacies,
because otherwise they had too much light.
[SPEAKER_05]: The period of photosynthesis was too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, this didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what he claimed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do you think that was the time for
photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was he, in fact, dropping the
temperature in some way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he's down here to defend himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done any experiments with the
period of high light photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't see a rationale for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't see a rationale.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the heat swallowed out was the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to put the shade over five p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there is a stress that I think
occurs on crops that we don't appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might be aware of work done with
photosynthetic compression.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, it's actually damage to the
photosynthetic apparatus when you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: bright light and cool temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in England, in fact, they were able to
attribute whether the corn crop made it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was associated with how many cool,
bright mornings they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually clear photosynthetic
damage to the University of Essex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how often that occurs in our
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically don't let our crops get cold,
but in some locations they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually causes suppression,
long-term suppression as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool and bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do our temperature drop for semi-
elongated vegetation, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing that we see is actually that
cool temperature damage to the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the take-home messages I got from
your talk is that a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: while it's a controlled environment,
it's still an imperfect place to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to do a lot more to optimize
carbon dioxide, optimize light,
[SPEAKER_03]: and optimize temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end of your talk,
you showed an interesting slide with this
[SPEAKER_03]: rotating drone and plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is pretty unrealistic,
but maybe it's not so unrealistic to think
[SPEAKER_03]: about a factory warehouse growing if you
could optimize all of those conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it could be economically feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bob worked on this for a while,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob was interested in this for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is possible to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just whether it's cost-efficient to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I would do, frankly,
and we're in the process of doing this at
[SPEAKER_01]: the university now, this room is warm and
it's comfortable because the thermostat
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of us is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is to take the light
sensors and all the sensors associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with plant growth and put them where the
plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing I would do as
part of this lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is that I would find out
where your actual light levels are,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I bet you, in the growth chambers
named greenhouses, you are suppressing
[SPEAKER_01]: growth more than what you appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's occurring across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's occurring in growth
chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as factory production, there are
places that want to do factory production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in many cases, it, frankly,
is a lot cheaper to just do traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see the economics to do
factory production yet, as long as you
[SPEAKER_01]: have accessible land.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Minneapolis, if you drive 30 minutes,
you're in open farmland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to spend all the money to
do an intensive system in a factory when
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have a non-intensive system that
may be more cost-effective 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to say that, because it's
reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those greenhouses with the deficiency
of light system within the canopy,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the future, a new technology LED light
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be stopped for something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a solution for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, you can create an optimal
environment for plant learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to know what the parameters
are that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is whether it's going to be
economical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a separate question, because what
I'm telling you is our plants probably
[SPEAKER_01]: could use more light than what we're
giving them.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, maybe economical.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, we just discussed this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New Hampshire, the cost of electricity
is $0.12.50 per kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Minneapolis, it's $3.50 per kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our economics are very different for
lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had some CO2 graphs, but I don't know
if you mentioned the period or the time
[SPEAKER_05]: that was done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are some experiments that
show that if you've got a short-term
[SPEAKER_05]: bursting growth, but if you have the CO2
present all the time, there's an
[SPEAKER_05]: acclimation that comes back that was
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you found that in your crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is no, because frankly,
the basis for adding CO2 to tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse is an increase in yield is
because they get a permanent increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're looking at is acclimation
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That burst in that two-hour
high-temperature pulse, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: if we do it periodically, whether the
plant doesn't depress, but actually adapts
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing that actually right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a good point to plan to
do acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually a recent paper in
Arabidopsis related to this, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: found that Arabidopsis did not acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it was just permanently increased.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any more time for other
questions for John?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's thank him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
