[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have this I'm going to take
you on on two whirlwind tours of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden one that shows the weaknesses of
the garden and One that I hope shows our
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths I'll then try to slow down and
talk a little bit about the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: this garden both in the past and today and
the last part I hope that Don Rakow will
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it the last part is of my
presentation will be about our attempts to
[SPEAKER_00]: to respect the past and Prepare the future
that is to say how how do we cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: this space?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we cultivate a historical garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do we do it that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it the same as in the past or not
in some sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's public garden management So here's
for a whirlwind tour of the garden first
[SPEAKER_00]: with its weaknesses then when it with its
strengths First weakness is when you work
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you see If you walk up the
ramp, that's what you see If you walk down
[SPEAKER_00]: the steps on the other side That's what
you see if you go look up That's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see above the peach trees If you keep
walking you go through a door and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: a wall without trees that seems to be
falling Well, not let's say just unkempt
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to the back of the garden you
start seeing the tops of the gardens the
[SPEAKER_00]: tops of the walls are not so good either
The bottoms of the walls neither I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not good English, but I'll survive
The walls are separating When we're
[SPEAKER_00]: against the trees we haven't taken off the
ferns or the mosses If you're at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the wall, sometimes you're not
quite sure you should walk through the
[SPEAKER_00]: door If you look up you understand why the
bottom of the door is not working if you
[SPEAKER_00]: walk to the very back You notice I
shouldn't point this out but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway We still have asbestos in the
garden It's covered by moss though We'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get rid of it one day This is what
our garages look like We haven't replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: all the windows The car model is from the
1970s If you try to leave the garden you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see there were some reparations
but some of the edges are not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: good and this is what's left of our last
greenhouse from the 19th century the
[SPEAKER_00]: others were destroyed Sometimes walls
actually fall down This was a year ago
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same wall from the other
direction This is what it looks like today
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting there It's actually a type
of youth build program that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuild the wall this summer Concretely
that means I didn't spend any money to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it Because the entire garden which is I
have to remember this 24 acres 9.4
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares is I manage it with 40,000 euros
not counting salaries but the total
[SPEAKER_00]: investment of how to say functioning money
is 40,000 euros so let's say $50,000 for
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 acres Actually I still have to mention
another big problem I forgot I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention something else This presentation
is rather general and for those of you who
[SPEAKER_00]: would be interested in a history of plant
selection and fruits and vegetables you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to stay for SOHO afterwards I just
wanted to mention that and I also wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to mention that I was an undergraduate and
that when I was an undergraduate here I
[SPEAKER_00]: never imagined I'd be coming back for a
second time to give a talk here Just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I'd have to mention that The
biggest problem is actually not all what I
[SPEAKER_00]: just showed you The biggest problem is
this The biggest problem we have in this
[SPEAKER_00]: garden is drainage It was built on an old
swamp and they put in a massive drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the 17th century It hasn't been
properly kept up and so we're faced with
[SPEAKER_00]: some real questions of root asphyxiation
and other difficulties of that type So
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the problems You'll notice that
I use this as a punctuation It's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: change from one subject to another What of
our strengths?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do another whirlwind tour of the
garden but this time a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start in an early winter
morning and we're going to go to a late
[SPEAKER_00]: fall afternoon So if I go towards the sun
I find myself in the alleyways We're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular garden created at the end of the
17th century This whole system of
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives of straight lines but that
aren't all that controlling If I go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward I go towards spring For me it's
the most anxious ridden part of the year I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it is for any fruit grower It's not
the moment where I'm working the most but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the moment where I sleep the least If
I go through the door and I take a right I
[SPEAKER_00]: go towards summer It's the king's gate in
the back The king's gate is the last
[SPEAKER_00]: original gate This gate is the last
original gate of the palace of Versailles
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see more general later,
you'll see This is still the whirlwind
[SPEAKER_00]: tour If I go around the central basin and
I look the other way I see the cathedral
[SPEAKER_00]: next door which is younger than the garden
The cathedral dates from 1742 The garden
[SPEAKER_00]: dates from 1678 or has begun to be
constructed in 1678 Generally when I look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this church the first thing I want to
do and the only thing I really want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in it is go to the top That's what the
garden looked like when I arrived about
[SPEAKER_00]: ten years ago You'll see a lot of dirt If
you look at more or less the same time of
[SPEAKER_00]: year a few years later it's changed
There's a lot more grass, a lot less dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: visible a lot less herbicide use We're
going to talk about that If we go towards
[SPEAKER_00]: autumn you can see some of our fruit tree
shapes some of our cabbage patches that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at more closely this is a
beurreardie it's a middle 19th century
[SPEAKER_00]: pear tree although the variety is middle
19th century the actual tree is about 140
[SPEAKER_00]: years old a five-tiered flat espace we
have 68 different fruit tree shapes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden This is going towards the autumn
the colors change and this is the setting
[SPEAKER_00]: sun behind the creator of the garden whose
name is Jean-Baptiste Lacantini
[SPEAKER_00]: punctuation Those are my two whirlwind
tours Now let's try to get a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific and try to give a context try to
understand the old uses and the new uses
[SPEAKER_00]: of this garden This is all of Versailles
This is the palace and the kitchen garden
[SPEAKER_00]: is right here A closer look, that was an
early 18th century map this is a middle
[SPEAKER_00]: 19th century map just because it has a
nicer close-up and nicer colors you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the kitchen garden better you can see
the extent of the palace you should
[SPEAKER_00]: realize this is the only thing that's
really new the only thing that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: new about Versailles basically is that
when you go when you walk this you've
[SPEAKER_00]: walked 600 meters so you've walked not
quite half a mile but that's a single
[SPEAKER_00]: facade the basic innovation of Versailles
is its size after that there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: technical innovations about how to make
flat glass how to drain but the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about Versailles is just its size so
it ends up with a kitchen garden which
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't an acre or two acres but 24 acres
what does it look like today that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like today an aerial view from a
few years ago you can see the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: palace you can see the Orangerie which has
approximately 2,500 large potted plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that go in and out and you have the
kitchen garden here with the school that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden along the buildings because
today it's a school we'll get to that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is just to try to point out how the garden
changes this is a mid 18th century it's
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down but you'll see why this is a
mid 18th century map this is a mid 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century map the big difference is that
aren't all that obvious okay here you have
[SPEAKER_00]: three gardens it's going to become one or
two here you have diagonal walls they will
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear you have 11 gardens here we
still call them the 11 gardens but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: only five because some of the walls got
taken out okay there are other differences
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically the shape has stayed the
same the big difference you can see here
[SPEAKER_00]: is the number of glass houses in the mid
19th in the mid 18th century there was
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of glass glass jars glass bells i
don't know you call them in english cloche
[SPEAKER_00]: you say cloche i should have known i
should have known that and lots of hotbeds
[SPEAKER_00]: but there weren't much there weren't many
greenhouses actually i think you see one
[SPEAKER_00]: on the on the image the only greenhouse
that existed at the time was right here
[SPEAKER_00]: and in french the word for greenhouse is
serre s-e-r-r-e and everyone thinks that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a greenhouse originally a serre is
a place where you reserre which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: you or you reorganize no you store things
and this is the serre but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse it's where everything was
stocked so this why this map why is it
[SPEAKER_00]: important although it's upside down
because in 1874 which is when mid 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century i exaggerate second half is in
1874 a school was created in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and since 1874 the kitchen garden is no
longer under the administration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: palace so it's been 140 years now that
this garden is separate from the palace
[SPEAKER_00]: always in the school when it was first
created it was the national school of
[SPEAKER_00]: french horticulture today it is the
national school for landscape architecture
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the map we show today that we give
to our visitors the idea is you come in
[SPEAKER_00]: over here this is the entrance today
although the historic entrance is here you
[SPEAKER_00]: come in here the departure is always here
for the visits but two three four and we
[SPEAKER_00]: take you around the garden today it's no
longer the landscape horticulture school
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the landscape architecture school and
the logo for the school national school of
[SPEAKER_00]: superior means higher education it doesn't
mean that superior to others it simply
[SPEAKER_00]: means that it's not elementary or
secondary school after secondary comes
[SPEAKER_00]: superior universities are superior okay so
it's part of the university system but the
[SPEAKER_00]: logo for the school is a my english is
terrible the stylized version of the of
[SPEAKER_00]: the central square of the kitchen garden
and that for me is very important because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the question of how do you go from
garden to landscape and the pedagogical
[SPEAKER_00]: how to say the educational progression of
the students in the landscape architecture
[SPEAKER_00]: school go from a first year about garden
creating gardens to a second year about
[SPEAKER_00]: larger urban spaces or larger spaces and a
third year working on coastal or railroad
[SPEAKER_00]: tracks that that that that cross entire
landscapes so the hot the idea is to go
[SPEAKER_00]: from small to large from microcosm to
microcosm to macrocosm the school is
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the garden but you do have to
understand or realize that there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fundamental contradiction between
a historical garden and a landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture school they think of
themselves as conceptors artists creators
[SPEAKER_00]: often at least in france i'm not sure for
here they're not gardeners and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other hand there's a historic garden that
tries to that communicates with them but
[SPEAKER_00]: in which essentially they come and see
things occasionally here they discover
[SPEAKER_00]: what soil is and three days a year they
actually work in the garden this is a rare
[SPEAKER_00]: picture this is three days a year okay
actually three days a year the first year
[SPEAKER_00]: two days a year the second year one day or
the third year so one of the main projects
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of restoring this garden and i do
like landscape architects don't get me
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong i just want them to be more aware
that once they've created something you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to manage it there's a landscape
architect in france you might have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of whose name is gil clément who had a
phrase one day that i really liked he said
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape architects shouldn't be paid
until 10 years after they've given their
[SPEAKER_00]: project but i don't think landscape
architects would agree and i understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that they wouldn't agree so what how do
how do how can we make these things work
[SPEAKER_00]: together well if i try to zoom simply on
this picture i see this behind it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: project to try to make this school work
together work with the garden together is
[SPEAKER_00]: in that building in those two buildings to
take some of the spaces that are in them
[SPEAKER_00]: and use them to create a residency for
international landscape architects where
[SPEAKER_00]: they both will be interested in what the
in teaching with the students of the
[SPEAKER_00]: school and also in working with the garden
the idea is that they come and we find a
[SPEAKER_00]: space within the garden to work with them
try to do the two together so we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of actually raising money for this
and we've raised not that much but some
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will start we're looking for
essentially three million euros and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already raised over half of it so we're
getting there it's not a we're well on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way and we'll start construction we'll
start redoing because you don't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: very well in this picture but we'll start
redoing some of the problems on the
[SPEAKER_00]: windows and at the end of the summer and
installing some of the spaces we'll all be
[SPEAKER_00]: well we will already be receiving some
international artists this fall that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: aerial view and as usual my punctuation
because all this is very important but
[SPEAKER_00]: what's most important to me is not just
the students it's the gardeners because
[SPEAKER_00]: the space doesn't exist without gardeners
without you know the garden doesn't exist
[SPEAKER_00]: unless there are gardeners you can have a
forest you can have spaces without
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners but you can't have a garden
without gardener and and what they do when
[SPEAKER_00]: I arrived in the garden 2004 both these
men were working Jacques and Francois and
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2007 2008 they retired both of them and
they had to be replaced well the idea was
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace them before they left so that
there be some transmission and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced essentially by these two young
men who've grown a bit older since this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture to do the same things that were
being done before so we have 68 different
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit tree shapes this is one that's
particular has each one has a name by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way and they're actually there's a we have
a list of over 250 that we would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: make but get to keep all of them going
this is one that takes a good 25 years to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it's called the vase Medici so that's
an early 20th century picture this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: early 21st century picture this is a fruit
variety from the middle of the 17th
[SPEAKER_00]: century one of the ones that was
originally cultivated by Lacantini so the
[SPEAKER_00]: creator of the garden and that we still
have in the garden today this is a and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was that this is a mid 18th century
print but this is a 17th century pear that
[SPEAKER_00]: we still have in the garden today and that
I chose to show with our 450 different
[SPEAKER_00]: historic well not just historical 450
different fruit variety if I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable the person who is now
responsible generally responsible what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call the the captain is Christine
Christine Dufour I was like I don't do my
[SPEAKER_00]: job properly if I don't talk about the
gardeners they're the ones who are outside
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's cold not me I'm here with you I
hope to come back here with this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: with her we'll see if it works or not
somehow rather I'm in the position of a
[SPEAKER_00]: coach I try to give a perspective I try to
create a plan I try to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can work but she's one who gets the work
done what do they do well with she's
[SPEAKER_00]: particular on vegetables but she also
takes care of the fruit this is the the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable team in their different areas of
predilection whether it be herbs greater
[SPEAKER_00]: production or tropical plants for David we
use old catalogs not so much to recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: but to find to have ideas about what
worked then what works now so in 1909
[SPEAKER_00]: among the most popular tomato fruits were
this one here which one there it is five
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I'll get it and we still have it
in the garden now we have generally we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't we every year I was talking mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christopher Dunn this morning about how he
functions with the vegetable garden and we
[SPEAKER_00]: do much the same thing actually we can't
do everything every year it's not possible
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have about we try to have a
selection of between 300 and 400 vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties every year and the idea is to
have some that what we are what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: collection we try them out and some that
we are producing and you'll see why I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in just a moment because we
sell everything we produce and forgot
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was so we have some in collection
some in production anywhere between 300
[SPEAKER_00]: and 400 varieties every year every two
years we try to choose one that we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: know better so we will do one year 80
tomato varieties but generally we do
[SPEAKER_00]: between 25 and 30 we do the same thing for
example for for beans this is a late 18th
[SPEAKER_00]: century drawing we have beans just want to
remind you that it was a tropical plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: one point we did one year we have had over
a hundred varieties of beans and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks that these are in terms of people
come to visit the garden yes they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: for the gardeners because for them to know
about beans they have to try them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to be able to answer questions
from our from our visitors we have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge so if we only stick on the
15 or 20 bean varieties we're used to we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't answer the questions that people
come to see us so every year we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: take eggplant or peppers or scallions
onions we try to do every year try to try
[SPEAKER_00]: out as many as we can find but generally
in terms of what we produce for regular
[SPEAKER_00]: production we're we're about a hundred
varieties but we go up to 300 or 400
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on on the year we're doing but
we're not just fruits and vegetables there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a small group one or two gardeners who
work on general uptake we have a small you
[SPEAKER_00]: say rosary you say we have a small rosary
of about 60 different varieties we have
[SPEAKER_00]: about 800 different taxons of ornamental
plants on purpose or not on purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there the older person who was
there in 2004 the younger person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: there now we have a young team what do
they take care of well we have this 200
[SPEAKER_00]: long meter terrace that has two sides of
boxwood that's what it looks like in
[SPEAKER_00]: winter that's what it looks like in summer
that's already a bit of work and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: box in many other parts of the garden as
well that needs to be taken care of is
[SPEAKER_00]: there a boxwood blight here as well I want
to tear them up anyway they smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: piss in the summer in the spring and
they're totally unproductive and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not existing in this garden in the 17th
century they were introduced in the 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to replace them by herbal
aromatic herbal borders the gardeners are
[SPEAKER_00]: in revolt against me because it's more
work and basically that's the only thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: can say about box is that the reason box
exists is it's less work than the rest I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope the people who like box don't
disagree too much but I haven't found
[SPEAKER_00]: another reason for box yet we have a fruit
of sedum which is in some sense what's
[SPEAKER_00]: left over from the horticultural school
when it was there and these are two of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite plants in the fruit of sedum we
have a hundred and so hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy-four ornamental shrubs that are
stuck in a corner of the garden that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: xanthosilum simulans which is a Sichuan
pepper and a poncierustri with my French
[SPEAKER_00]: accent poncierustri foliata so ponzerous
whatever all the orange trees are are
[SPEAKER_00]: grafted on but it makes great yellow fruit
that you can grate or use to aromatize to
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatize to flavor jams and I'll talk
about that in a little while too but the
[SPEAKER_00]: real point of all these gardeners is this
the real point of this kitchen garden has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been to be a kitchen garden because
so far that's not what I've shown you we
[SPEAKER_00]: produce about 40 tons of fruit we produce
about 20 25 tons of vegetables and it all
[SPEAKER_00]: gets sold in a small space at the entrance
some people think that's a lot I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very little for 24 acres the
gardeners think it's a lot of work and I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them but I did a simple
calculation just the other day if I take
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 tons of fruit and I transform about 15
into juice and jam that only leaves me
[SPEAKER_00]: with 25 tons if I have a 10% loss 20% loss
storage shift everything else I'm down to
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 tons and if I tried to do that over 52
weeks I got with only 150 kilos a week
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not that much so 40 times is not
very much oh I'm I'm I talked about jams I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a present for Don and I have a
present for Soho but they'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose how they want to work this is our
mug and this is two of our jams two pair
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties so you'll have to choose
afterwards but that's what we do that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do that is you know that is how we
make our money that's how we equilibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: our budget our budget it's a public garden
owned by the state but we have to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: living and I think that's very important
in terms of public garden management the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that a garden can be productive can
be visited and can produce produce we do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything jams we make the jams ourselves
we also dry our own peppers our own we
[SPEAKER_00]: make our own Provence mix and we even have
partnerships with a tea company this is
[SPEAKER_00]: our mug we even have partnership with a
tea company where there we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular apple variety which I adore
which is called and it's called Canada but
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody wants to buy anymore in France
because it's wonderful cooked but people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't cook apples anymore they always want
to eat them fresh they want to eat them
[SPEAKER_00]: raw it's very difficult to sell several
tons of this apple but it has a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and a great aroma we found a
solution we sell it to a tea company they
[SPEAKER_00]: extract the aroma they use it to flavor
their teas it's our biggest seller I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to remember what I haven't told you
yet in terms of the time okay and once I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about food the what I think is
probably the most important thing people
[SPEAKER_00]: come to this garden because it's a
historic garden they come there because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Versailles they come because Louis
the 14th and there's this image there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this there's this trademark here you have
David the one who likes tropical fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and who's also one of our best ambassadors
they come for that reason but we want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave with a better understanding of
today's contemporary stakes for fruit and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable production and consumption how
does it function I mean I I've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of I used to think this wasn't true
but I've taken groups of not so young
[SPEAKER_00]: children into the garden and shown them a
potato plant and had them say to me
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the potato and I've shown them pea
plants and and I've even taken adults into
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden and showed them a spinach plot
and the person said I wear the spinach and
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that the person could recognize
it when it was on a on a shelf because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was separated it was only spinach but when
it was mixed in with gallon soga or with
[SPEAKER_00]: something else and it was close to the
ground they couldn't recognize it so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically when they come in the garden
they come to see historic garden we want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to leave with a better understanding
of fruits and vegetables so that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to do now this is David
talking to a group this is what we try to
[SPEAKER_00]: show to our groups this is an exhibition I
did in 2000 we did in 2007 about fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties it was an ex we took three
editions of a book a seven a book from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1768 was republished in the early 19th
century and we tried to put the varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in the book out and we tried to
show that the three versions of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: book didn't describe them the same way and
that somehow rather people should give up
[SPEAKER_00]: on trying to give a specific name to a
variety we did an exhibition about beans
[SPEAKER_00]: where I discovered something rather
important for me at least industrial how
[SPEAKER_00]: to say those beans string green beans that
were bred to flower at the same time be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested at the same time to stand up to
transformation into whatever are often not
[SPEAKER_00]: good when you eat them after
transformation but when they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and you eat them fresh you can
pick them yourself they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent so the problem really is on the
processing side because some of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial varieties that everybody is
screaming about but they're not good when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in the processed food can be
excellent when they're in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was I thought that in terms of trying
to understand how our agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: functions that's an important point to say
that modern varieties are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: bad they can have some real interest
including taste the question is how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're used afterwards so maybe we have
to not just yell at the farmers we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to educate people to cook better we
did an exhibition this was purely for the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape architecture students this was
my this was this is what I call thumbing
[SPEAKER_00]: my nose we did an exhibition about
pollination because I was tired of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: comments about landscape architects who
didn't know about plants being allergenic
[SPEAKER_00]: and I did a presentation in front of the
Board of Trustees of the school and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned a landscape architect who had
populated a who had planted a schoolyard
[SPEAKER_00]: with lots of beach lots of birch trees and
birch trees are among the most allergenic
[SPEAKER_00]: what I didn't know when I did this
presentation was that the president of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Board of Trustees was that landscape
architect but it still went over fine
[SPEAKER_00]: because the students did learn that plants
were allergenic how to bring people to the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden we have we've been having this will
be our eighth or ninth year we have a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a school it's a school of landscape
architecture we have a festival a modern
[SPEAKER_00]: art festival you know in a historical
garden every year it's essentially dance
[SPEAKER_00]: it's essentially conceptual dance in a
movement in France called non-dance and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's wonderful I think it's a
great example of bringing people to a
[SPEAKER_00]: historical space to remind them this
historical space is always about being new
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not about being old and when it was
created it was created to be new so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: keep using it as a space that's new every
year we have a annual harvest festival you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do without it it's the moment of the
year where we have the most amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to sell and so we need a lot of
people to buy them and it's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment where we can show the most diverse
things of what we do so every year first
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend of October we try to present the
70 or 80 varieties of fruit that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: available that we can sell at that point
and as many varieties of vegetables this
[SPEAKER_00]: is an example and this is where we get to
how do we cultivate I look at the hour
[SPEAKER_00]: most people will see Louise Bonne which is
one of my favorite pears on the left and
[SPEAKER_00]: Calville Blanc which is one of my favorite
apples on the right I often compare
[SPEAKER_00]: Calville Blanc to Jonah Gold as the
example as the difference between Bordeaux
[SPEAKER_00]: and California oh I got myself into it now
I tell you why I do I don't usually say
[SPEAKER_00]: that one but California wine this was
worth out there no there we go for me it's
[SPEAKER_00]: big juicy fruit right away it's wonderful
it's it's it's how to say it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: it's explode it's an explosion and if
you're used to California Cabernet
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauvignon and you drink a Bordeaux
generally you're disappointed it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you know it's not as big it's not
Jonah Gold when you taste it it explodes
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mouth it's a it's a it's a
wonderful apple you taste the Calville
[SPEAKER_00]: Blanc and the first thing you say is oh
it's an apple and then 30 seconds later
[SPEAKER_00]: you say wait there's still a taste there
there's a little bit of fennel there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of mint but there's
the apple is strong and then two minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: later it's still in your nose and you're
saying what what's it still doing there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the difference between California
Cabernet and a Bordeaux Cabernet Calville
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not what I see I'll show you
what I see I hope that some of you see it
[SPEAKER_00]: too how many people see apples or pears on
the market with scab that's what we do all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and I hope that people can get
used to it we're not organic but we do
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and even if we do spray with not
with organic they still have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: dressed up that way and we call it our
Chernobyl suits and how do you do that in
[SPEAKER_00]: a public garden above and beyond I do not
know the the regular the rules in the
[SPEAKER_00]: states but in our case there's even on
copper sulfate with there's a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: limit before going on to how do you do
that in the public garden that's open
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days a week and how do you do it
when you're in a public garden that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces fruits and vegetables and next to
the trees you have strawberries and just
[SPEAKER_00]: stay on copper sulfate remember right it's
21 days before harvest what do you do well
[SPEAKER_00]: you can say you sprayed the trees and not
the fruit the strawberries so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still bring the strawberries to the store
ethically I'm not up for it okay how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: do it well we find solutions one way or
another our first solutions we no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: treat the central square where the fruit
trees and the vegetables are in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: place I have not asked for an organic
label we've known a 60% lowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest but we're still making it and
we're going to probably do something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to shock not you but shock
the the people I work for or the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are guarantees in terms of the state
for the preservation of historic monuments
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to tear out the pear trees and
put in plum trees slightly different shape
[SPEAKER_00]: two arguments first of all it'll give us
time to know how to cultivate pear trees
[SPEAKER_00]: without treating them because for the
moment we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: and plum trees will only last 20-25 years
and espaliered shape so it's just a time
[SPEAKER_00]: period and the second reason is because
plum trees we can treat them during the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter we don't have many visitors and
they are vigorous enough to survive most
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks until we harvest them in July
we'll see but it has been 320-340 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now that it's been the central square has
been cultivated with pear trees and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people take me to be a bit radical the
other choice of course is to find
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to phytophthora that's what I
worked on when I was in here at Cornell I
[SPEAKER_00]: spent hours in the lab trying to go
through to try to find mutant spores well
[SPEAKER_00]: we do treat them with copper sulfate but
we do it very specifically in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: situations and not all the time and
sometimes we even do it when visitors are
[SPEAKER_00]: there because it's a way for them to go
and to talk to them because in the states
[SPEAKER_00]: if I remember right only 2% of the
population is agricultural today in France
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not that much more it's four there is
a huge educational challenge in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting people to know where what they eat
comes from it's also when and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: items on purpose for here gallin soga is
in a North American plant this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbit also an American North American
plant or American plant where where are
[SPEAKER_00]: the squash in there have to get people
used to seeing that too and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener is happy when he finds one they
react poorly to this they react poorly to
[SPEAKER_00]: the one before this is my favorite way of
dealing with weeds in the garden at least
[SPEAKER_00]: in our garden I think it's perfectly fine
I think that we did the entire garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: black plastic that's woven though and
biodegradable but I don't think people
[SPEAKER_00]: would appreciate it either but this is how
we deal in a historic garden with
[SPEAKER_00]: producing tomatoes peppers we do some
green manure and when they see this they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand when they see this they
understand a bit better but I'm not that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more satisfied because if we have too
much cilia facility foot area whatever in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall we create problems for our
honeybees because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting later they're not going to be
able to dry out the nectar as long and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have honey that freezes so
we have to be careful about our green
[SPEAKER_00]: manure as well people complain when they
come to the garden and they see this I
[SPEAKER_00]: complained to the garden when I arrived
and I saw this because that's how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: dealt with before we're now at zero
herbicide use but we do have more grass
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think the next three pictures are
probably what I would like to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: most and that probably the whole
presentation was just for these three
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful fruit tree shapes what do we do
with our soil this is herbicide use since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1969 that's when Jacques who I showed you
on the first picture arrived he spent a
[SPEAKER_00]: year with a hoe in his hand and he got
sick of it and he started using herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden was cultivated with herbicides
almost entirely up until 2004 2005 2006 we
[SPEAKER_00]: said we have to stop we have to find
solutions that was the first idea but it
[SPEAKER_00]: took a lot of work geotextile the idea was
to have something clean underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant something where we could still
continue to see the tree because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: also dealing with this that the solution
we have today is this one because we found
[SPEAKER_00]: a machine for mechanical cultivation under
the trees that we adapted from fruit from
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard culture we still have to mow the
lawn but we have other ideas for that
[SPEAKER_00]: where we let them some of them flower but
the basic question is what are we doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a historical garden how does this function
are we a professional fruit growers
[SPEAKER_00]: searching for solutions for professional
fruit growing are we a historical garden
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be faithful to what the people
did 300 years ago and my answer is both we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to find solutions to both 300 years
ago they were already producing in large
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities for the King's table today we
have to continue producing in large
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities 300 years ago they had visitors
today we have visitors we have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those two together we both have to take
into account modern techniques modern
[SPEAKER_00]: limits and we also have to remember the
intentions with which it was created
[SPEAKER_00]: and for me the way here the difference
between this whoops sorry this picture and
[SPEAKER_00]: this picture is a difference in how we
relate to our environment in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: picture we're producing fruits that's it
we have fruit tree shapes we're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit in this picture we're managing a
space and as soon as we start managing a
[SPEAKER_00]: space that has ideas about production
we're also producing other things we're
[SPEAKER_00]: also taking care and this is very easy to
say and I've sure you've heard this a lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of times but we're taking part of an
ecosystem and we're taking part of both
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated and wild this is one this is
the largest wild French solitary bee this
[SPEAKER_00]: is we have a huge population of this that
nobody really understands why we have it
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have it in the garden and I've
tried to study it a little bit and it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting conundrum we have it because
we used herbicides because it likes sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that doesn't have plant on it they
want to make its burrows to make its nest
[SPEAKER_00]: and so when we no longer use herbicide we
are in part eliminating this wild being
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll find we'll have to find some
solutions beneficial insects of course
[SPEAKER_00]: he's up I couldn't resist sorry for the
eternal ladybug and it's strawberry I
[SPEAKER_00]: always thought the walls in the garden
were there for a heat that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody when I arrived in this garden
everyone told me that walls are there to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate heat I think the walls are
there to accumulate beneficial insects and
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae that eat the ones we don't want
because I think in terms of the heat it
[SPEAKER_00]: works it works even better when you try to
put the tomato plants out in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden you put the tomato plants
against the wall even a north facing wall
[SPEAKER_00]: you still have healthier tomato plants I
think has to do with its environment we
[SPEAKER_00]: even have a hawk that I found I got a
picture of the other day so I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: include it
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go very quickly this is you
have to the garden is inserted in the town
[SPEAKER_00]: on the one we have one side this one side
is the park the three other sides are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city so if we use some kind of general
name or a pirate or when we used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use rote knowns you're always
blowing excuse my language you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing all the insects away and we have
no way of recuperating them other than
[SPEAKER_00]: within our own garden so when you're in
this kind of how to say urban desert on
[SPEAKER_00]: one side or diversity desert on the other
you have to find ways of creating
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity within the garden itself this is
the fruit of sedum this theory that where
[SPEAKER_00]: we have all the different shrubs that's
part of it it looks a bit more unkempt
[SPEAKER_00]: than you can imagine their site to
generally be well that's the garden I work
[SPEAKER_00]: in we've included some within the fruit
growing areas we've included some
[SPEAKER_00]: non-productive hedges and we can we really
see the difference between the side and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not proven scientifically though I'd
love someone to come study it with us we
[SPEAKER_00]: the impression the gardeners and I have is
that the side towards the shrub towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-productive hedge is less attacked
than the one that's not and we've had that
[SPEAKER_00]: same experience with our prairies that
we've sometimes replaced the grass with
[SPEAKER_00]: because we got sick of mowing or rather
the budget couldn't deal with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing in this case we intervene three
times in the year once to prepare once to
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and once to mow as opposed to mowing
every 12 days and we do that in several
[SPEAKER_00]: places throughout the garden this is my
favorite current experiment this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture from just three weeks ago this is
our I transformed a space that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: below the offices of the director of the
school that used to be a more alone okay
[SPEAKER_00]: and just below the windows of the last
year students into a permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and it's quite I shouldn't say
I the guard after working with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: students of the school and the gardens
this is how we transformed it so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on it actually it's based on a
Quebec
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a vegetable producer just outside
of Quebec who's written a book in both
[SPEAKER_00]: French and English that takes up on
Elliott Coleman's book and we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those techniques there Ellie
Coleman and for time using books from the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the 19th century from Parisian
gardeners we even have some not just
[SPEAKER_00]: insects but some geese and some chickens
that have helped out I call them there
[SPEAKER_00]: there are gardeners as well we have some
sheep that we hope they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked by this that we regularly kill and
barbecue that's also part of educating in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of food it always gets me angry when
people only want they don't want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the carcass the angry is not the right
word disappoints me I think we really have
[SPEAKER_00]: food education to be done I don't think
everyone should be carnivorous my
[SPEAKER_00]: companion is vegetarian it's not a just
think about knowing where things come from
[SPEAKER_00]: before making decisions this is my dream
actually this is I'm almost finished I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been pretty good people often think we do
exhibitions for people to see outside I do
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibitions for because I want the
gardeners to see what we're doing or where
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be going I think we could
probably eliminate some of our tractors we
[SPEAKER_00]: have small garden tractors with some
donkeys and I think we'll get there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next two or three years actually because
it's a it's a different relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: the space it's a different way of working
and it's a great way to try to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: people come to this garden to see how we
do it don't forget it's about food it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardeners it's in a wonderful space
and it will always be a school thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: this has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu you
