[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave mentioned that I've been doing a lot
of traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: My primary responsibility for this year
and probably for the next two years is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be training our conservation planners
within the Natural Resources Conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have to be certified for
conservation planning, and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: courses that are required is the economics
of conservation planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we teach, we've been teaching,
I've got eight weeks this summer I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching it and we've got other
counterparts that are teaching as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have to change, we have to do
within five years 3,000 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done though for this
particular talk is taking some principles
[SPEAKER_00]: that we teach our planners and applied it
to the soil health concept for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to window it down and
actually talk about soil health in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and some case studies that have been
done here in New York that I helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a retired economist,
Flo Schwartz, who has worked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the case studies actually is
Dave Magus' farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out at the end so it doesn't kind
of take you away from my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down arrow, you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about a little bit
about the different soil health management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that NRCS will provide technical
and financial assistance for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more practices, soil health
related, but these are kind of the core
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are used within NRCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the conservation tillage,
crop rotation, cover cropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: field orders of perium buffers,
nutrient management, and integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do economists compare these
different practices and help to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: information to producers so that they can
make an informed decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would work for them in their
particular operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we divide things,
of course, into benefits and costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the benefits, NRCS looks at things
according to what we call SWAPA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is soil, water, air, plants,
animals, and then they added energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also human considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the type of benefit
categories that we look at when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this not only for on-farm,
but we do this when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: policy analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the costs, of course, are the typical
economic costs of land, labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, management, and risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, the off-farm and on-farm
benefits will differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking from a policy viewpoint,
you're looking at the off-farm benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for to be talking to a producer about
implementing practices, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at what is the impact to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some templates that we have
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Paul maybe can help me or maybe
some of these two contributions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's around 130 practices or so that we
have standards and specifications for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a counterpart of mine took those 130
practices and developed these templates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically take those categories
that I showed you before and talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: for each of these practices, what could
the potential positive effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects be for a producer if they
were to implement that practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helpful because when a
conservation planner goes on a farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to talk to it, they kind of have
a laundry list to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be some additional things
that are particularly on that farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a really good laundry list that
you can go through and say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: this doesn't apply here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps them categorize the benefits
and the costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave an example here of cover
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call those T-charts, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at economics and
what we teach our conservation planners is
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really looking at the change from
before to after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to look at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to look at enterprise
budgets and all of that unless we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really going down to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking to our producers,
we're just looking at the positive effects
[SPEAKER_00]: and the negative effects of the change
before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, the positive effects from a
partial budget could be increased revenues
[SPEAKER_00]: or reduced costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the negative effects could be
increased costs or decreased revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to help make up time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we take those concepts
and then we go through our T-charts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which come up with the different
categories we should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this we call level one, which is best
descriptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're looking at the
positive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment here, what they've done is
they've combined different practices into
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the system is looking at the whole
system on a field or on a farm or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be just one practice or it could
be a combination of practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a combination of practices is a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have a conservation
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have crop rotation, residue
management, pest management, and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through that and we talk
about the positive effects and the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the descriptive, we're just
talking about yield increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting a financial assistance
payment, that would be an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue on down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the negative effects could be you
have to buy no-till drill or increased
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management, those type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a short time period, you may actually
lose production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we outline all of that for a producer
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I jumped to a level three.
[SPEAKER_00]: A level two, just real briefly,
as you start putting numbers to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be like saving tons of soil per
acre or buying a no-till drill at $20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what the third example does is it
puts it in like terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you've got a crop
rotation and there's a formula that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can come up with to determine what the
average cost per acre per year is for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into detail, but it can be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reduce the cost by decreasing
fertilizer, reducing tillage passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing fuel and labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other positive effects,
improved soil and water quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you may have some sort of habitat
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the negative effects,
what they do is they take something like
[SPEAKER_00]: the purchase no-till drill and we amortize
it over a time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do all that, then you can
come up with a dollars per acre per year,
[SPEAKER_00]: positive impact and negative impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look, let me see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, did the wrong button, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, that's the sum of all the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's $60 per acre per year in this
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the negative effects,
the total is $22 per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the net benefits would be $38 per
acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that we do is we take all
this information and a lot of producers
[SPEAKER_00]: might say, well, this all sounds well and
good, but how does this really work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk to people or I'd like to
see some examples of real life
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're doing the case
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the benefit is that usually we use the
partial budget technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does give real world examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with the producers to develop
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good case study is not just a shining
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also shows the hardships that they've
gone through to get to where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because we
don't want to paint a rosy picture all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have trials and trips when
they do, when they change what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to make sure that it's
relatable to whoever your audience is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pick a producer that either is
respected or it relates, they've got very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar circumstances to the audience that
you're trying to provide this case study
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I want to say is when
you look at these case studies and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them out there, you want to read
it with a critical eye because different
[SPEAKER_00]: people have different agendas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's sometimes when they say,
oh, this looks really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got to get into the numbers
to see if they're accurate or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they inflate benefits or they
decrease costs or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that when you're looking at
things that you're really reading it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a critical eye and asking a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm going to the two examples
that I'm gonna hand out to people if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested are Angel Rose Dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, they did, both of these
are in central New York around the Ontario
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Watertown area, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in central New York somewhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Angel Rose Dairy where they
have been doing no-till and cover cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: on 350 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the total net benefits, it's over
$8,000 or $25,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: $24 per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read more details about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hand it out in these case studies,
the printouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to say about the
case studies is we try to make them two
[SPEAKER_00]: pages to hand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're meant to go to field days and
things like that so that people can very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a whole bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to delve into a lot of
research or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cut to the chase right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dave Maggis's farm now,
it was interesting that you're up to 800
[SPEAKER_00]: cows now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think ours was 670 or somewhere around
there when we did the case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that you're able to increase
production on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, there was 2,200 acres at that
point, which was two years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had total net benefits of over
$78,000 or $62 per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things to remember when you're
doing partial budgeting or looking at case
[SPEAKER_00]: studies is that when you adopt a
conservation system, you are looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with soil health, it's going to
take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how degraded your soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think they say that you'll see
more benefits quicker when more degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: soil than very improved soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are economic benefits that also
result in economic benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an example is the reduced yield
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're reducing risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soil health increases, you're not going
to get as much of a wild swing in yields
[SPEAKER_00]: that you might have had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's hard to quantify,
but it's something to be discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to realize the greatest
benefits from a system, you have to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out the system that works best on your
operation, given your challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's it.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
