[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to talk about my work a little
bit at first and then show you a few
[SPEAKER_03]: images of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my son Sam, he just went to
college this year and when he was a child,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had a kid's book about three bears that
encounter urban sprawl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these bears, they went up over a hill
near their den one morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked down, somebody's built a
shopping center overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, already people are hustling and
bustling up and down the sidewalk and they
[SPEAKER_03]: all look so satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the little bears, they're not sure
they're happy anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere they find people clothes and
the next sequence of pictures,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see these little pint-sized figures
moving amongst the legs of all the other
[SPEAKER_03]: passers-by and the caption reads,
well, now that they're like everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: else, are they really happy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, not really because underneath
those people clothes still beat their
[SPEAKER_03]: furry little animal hearts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, a big wind comes up it blows and
it blows, blows men's ties out,
[SPEAKER_03]: blows women's skirts up.
[SPEAKER_03]: One big gust blows off a little bear's
clothes off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the first time, they realize who
and what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, they go tearing back across the
parking lot, back to a place that they
[SPEAKER_03]: could just be themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't so many years ago as the
crow flies that I was getting ready for
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a coat and tie on and a briefcase.
[SPEAKER_03]: I start down my walkway and a really big
wind comes up and it blows and it blows.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first gust blows my briefcase right
down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second, blows off my coat and tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third blows everything else away.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm standing there completely amazed at
this unlikely turbulence in my life,
[SPEAKER_03]: the only thing I could feel under those
people clothes is thudding of an animal
[SPEAKER_03]: heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have this flashback to all these
times in my life that the only thing I
[SPEAKER_03]: could think about was giving up my regular
life, going off into the distance,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe into the wilderness and building a
small cabin and living in a more essential
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a time of change for me
and I found myself at the how-to section
[SPEAKER_03]: of the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw things like load-bearing and
R-factors and coefficients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, you know, building a house,
even a small cabin, might be a whole lot
[SPEAKER_03]: harder than I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: But luckily for me, as I start back across
the library, I happen to stumble on a big
[SPEAKER_03]: stack of national geographics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the first one I picked up was
about the barrios in Rio de Janeiro in
[SPEAKER_03]: which a whole segment of the population
that disenfranchised have to go out and
[SPEAKER_03]: pick up the dendritis the cast-offs of
urban life and take that material
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere and build them a place to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know I'm not supposed to like these
because these are really poor people and
[SPEAKER_03]: yet they've done an amazing job with the
material that they had at hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it was a tribe from the Amazon
basin who had to go into the jungle and
[SPEAKER_03]: forage whatever was available to build the
things they needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know these huts don't have any
running water or electricity, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful and they look so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the environment from which the
material came.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it was a bird from Africa that
had done an amazing engineering feat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, well, I know these birds are not
smart enough to do this, but in human
[SPEAKER_03]: terms, this would be amazing
craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was then I realized that maybe I
wasn't a normal builder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I was more of a hunter and gatherer,
some kind of an inspiration builder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did get started on that house and I
learned some things that really held me in
[SPEAKER_03]: good stead in my art life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the first is really the
simplest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's learning to accept what you do
because if you don't know much about
[SPEAKER_03]: building, you put a window in in the
morning, boy, by noon, you're totally
[SPEAKER_03]: disgusted with yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take that thing right out of
it, right out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be fair to myself, I decided that
each day I would try to do the very best
[SPEAKER_03]: job I could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I would accept my
progress and the next day I would build on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing is you use nonstandard
materials like so many sculptors do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't always go to Home Depot and
Lowe's and buy the things you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, if you cut a big tree down
from the woods and decide to use it as the
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstay of your house, how do you know it
would work and who would you ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I played a game with myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called giving it my one best shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, if there's nobody left on
earth, what do I think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I think it's strong enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere along there, I began
accepting responsibility for the kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I designed and made.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third thing is working day in and day
out in a very unselfconscious way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I begin to see what I like and what I
didn't like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw how important personal preference is
in making those decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over a period of time, I began to
develop my own sense of personal
[SPEAKER_03]: aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, I saw how important need was
in getting anything done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really needed this house, so I was able
to coalesce my best energies and direct my
[SPEAKER_03]: best problem-solving skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes when I have a sculptor
friend who's not doing that well with
[SPEAKER_03]: their work, I'll say, hey, you have to
figure out how to need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't know it was getting out of
hand, but my neighbors did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were coming over to my house,
scratching their head and kicking the
[SPEAKER_03]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a friend, Brooks, brought us a
relative from another area of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I really like what you're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a real artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe for all of you, that'd be a
great thing for somebody to say about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it felt like the edge of the
earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted them to take it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And upon reflection, I realized that as a
child, I thought being an artist was the
[SPEAKER_03]: greatest thing you could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only trouble was it came with this
enormous sense of personal responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were supposed to do something great,
something earth-shaking, something that
[SPEAKER_03]: saved people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seemed like it was connected with
that onerous word talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow you were supposed to be talented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I knew what the word talent in art
had to do with Michelangelo and Leonardo
[SPEAKER_03]: da Vinci.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't figure out what it had to
do with me or anything I was doing at my
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one shimmering moment, I found myself
at the nearest art department enrolling in
[SPEAKER_03]: art history courses in sculpture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, for me, that minute,
that day was the best day of my life
[SPEAKER_03]: because I didn't know there was anybody
else like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know there were lots of people
who liked material, who liked just
[SPEAKER_03]: handling it, who liked seeing their ideas
get worked out in three dimension.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only trouble was I was an art nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd walk around and I'd say,
is this art?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this art?
[SPEAKER_03]: How come this person gets to paint this
board blue and call it art?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just about the whole fourth again
when the professor grabs me by the throat,
[SPEAKER_03]: starts choking me to death, and he said,
who in the hell cares if it's art or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just go in there and make
something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Make whatever you're going to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to know the difference in 20
years anyway?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I needed that permission
giving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned some things while I was in
school that I think helped towards my,
[SPEAKER_03]: propelled me to become a working artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the first is the importance of a
role model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't know if you had to have a
psychiatrist standing by when you made
[SPEAKER_03]: your first piece or whether you,
you know, had to have some kind of great
[SPEAKER_03]: family of people like getting a divorce or
leaving your boyfriend or girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you had to go to New York and
work as a waiter in order to qualify.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until I saw these relatively
normal people who were really compelled
[SPEAKER_03]: about making things that I realized there
was going to be some hope for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing is that it's hard to be a
food fattest unless there are other people
[SPEAKER_03]: around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not who eat beans and rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, it's hard to be a working
artist unless there are other people
[SPEAKER_03]: around who understand what you're going
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest, my biggest challenge as a
working artist is to maintain a sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: personal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is somewhat difficult in our
society that gives high marks to culture
[SPEAKER_03]: but really ignores individual makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's easy to have an identity crisis
at any time in your career in which you
[SPEAKER_03]: walk in your studio one morning and you
can't remember who made that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're glad that there's a
university art department around or that
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a friend at a distance that you
can call and say, hey Scott, are you still
[SPEAKER_03]: working?
[SPEAKER_03]: And somehow when he says he is,
you're able to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just go right on with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third thing that I began to see is
there's a big difference between doers and
[SPEAKER_03]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between people who make things and people
who look at them seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, there were two different jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, museum directors and curators
and gallery owners, their job is to decide
[SPEAKER_03]: what object or person is more inherently
interesting than another.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's not my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to be true to my materials and true
to my ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times when I start a work,
I don't even know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I had to worry about whether it was
good or not or whether it was art
[SPEAKER_03]: historically significant, I would really
never get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fourth thing is that I had to deal
with that word talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although I decided talent wasn't
irrelevant, it just wasn't the issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the right to make what I wanted,
whatever, you know, as much as I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I could do as much artwork as I
could afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at some shimmering moment, I decided to
go home, build a studio and get to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's one thing that you know that you
have the right to make something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another thing to know what you're
going to make and how you're going to make
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily for me, I kept up with the
university.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to see a lecture by a woman named
Marty Zelt who had been a seamstress in
[SPEAKER_03]: her life before sculpture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she brought to her sculpture work
Velcro fasteners and zippers and cloth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe in that lecture,
I say, I wonder what I already know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what simple method of joining
some simple method of technology that I
[SPEAKER_03]: might already be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I'm driving back home to my house,
I'm seeing all these saplings alongside
[SPEAKER_03]: the road where maintenance crews are
constantly striving to keep them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And much like Saul being struck off his
horse on the way to Damascus, I have an
[SPEAKER_03]: epiphysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, hey, maybe I could use those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't so unusual that a woodsman
like myself would see the potential of the
[SPEAKER_03]: saplings along his driveway because
they're plentiful, they're renewable,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like having a giant warehouse at your
fingertips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after working with this material for a
while, I realized that I had a deeper
[SPEAKER_03]: resonance with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd grown up in the woodlands of North
Carolina and we have lots of underbrush
[SPEAKER_03]: and intersecting lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as some kids laid in fields and looked
at the architectural details of clouds,
[SPEAKER_03]: I found myself studying the drawing
quality of the winter landscape,
[SPEAKER_03]: all those hatch marks in the trees,
all those imagined faces surrounded by
[SPEAKER_03]: branches up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I turned to sculpture,
it seemed easy to co-opt the forces of
[SPEAKER_03]: nature and play all that natural drawing
style out onto these larger works.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing I had to cope with and find out
about was that sticks had an inherent
[SPEAKER_03]: method of joining.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what beavers and birds already
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that if you pull a stick through the
woods, you start out pulling it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but more or less you start really jerking
it along after a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, it's got this infuriating
tendency to tangle with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really the simplest method of
joining.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every stick has a little flexibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you flex it and you pull it through a
matrix and let it go, it kind of snaps
[SPEAKER_03]: back and holds itself in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the how, but the what.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had seen me at the time,
I could probably spend five minutes in a
[SPEAKER_03]: museum before running down the steps with
sweaty palms and going, I think they've
[SPEAKER_03]: used all the good ideas up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you read an art magazine and you think
they've exploited every material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you find out that in the last census,
over a million people in New York City
[SPEAKER_03]: alone claimed to be visual artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say, whoa, there are too many of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love to make things, and so I just
decided the art world was going to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: lump it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I say about my work is that I make
temporary work which I build on site from
[SPEAKER_03]: materials that I gather somewhere nearby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the unique aspects of my work
is that there is no studio doors to close
[SPEAKER_03]: and no place to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out there in public view, and the
public sees the good and the bad of it as
[SPEAKER_03]: I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm on site, I like representing
making in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like interceding for the arts,
and I like demystifying the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mainly, I like reminding people that
artists are just normal people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for their rightful place in the
world of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to show you a few slides,
a few images that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my house and some otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, if you would turn the lights
down for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough to be able to put some
slides of the piece here in Cornell in the
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, I'd like to show you a
few pictures of my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I live in a small house,
but the reason I do is because I tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: use only recycled materials in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to use the smallest footprint I
could possibly get so that I could live
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried to work really hard myself at
being, you know, extending the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental message of using less.
[SPEAKER_03]: These stones I dug in the backyard and put
them into my wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not quite as good at the bottom,
better at the top, because I got better as
[SPEAKER_03]: I started working.
[SPEAKER_03]: The inside is, this is the better stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always sequence your materials,
and I do the same thing with my stick
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the bad sticks underneath and the
good sticks on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, the worst stones went on the
outside of the wall and the best ones went
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout the various roofs of my house,
I've got all this cedar split out that I
[SPEAKER_03]: got from my woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I really like the idea of
extending your landscape into your house
[SPEAKER_03]: and to be able to look out windows on all
sides and see the forest outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also something that doesn't have to be
painted, that always kind of just
[SPEAKER_03]: maintains itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've built a million sheds for myself and
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was built from all the material
that I cut where I put my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing, even though it's been quite
some time, this shed still stands and
[SPEAKER_03]: looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, I had to build a monument
to myself, because I was afraid no one
[SPEAKER_03]: would build it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a big laid up stone monument,
about eight by eight, that sits out in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of my yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like good stone work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has got no mortar in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a combination of feature
stones and little goodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, my neighbors were always
providing inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, it's called Waiting It Out
in Maple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were telling me what their kids left
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, things would be better in their
lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot of neighbors, so I put
this out in the front so they could see
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to show you a little bit
about materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is materials outside my yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at these pieces,
you think the lines must go on forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the lines we're using are
really short sticks, and your eye is
[SPEAKER_03]: making the jump between one line and
another.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Scott and we're about to bring
material into this gallery and start a
[SPEAKER_03]: work where it's a distance subtraction
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at an Indianapolis at the Heron
School.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always look for materials somewhere
they're not going to be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm beating the bulldozer to the
stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, the city is expanding its
golf course, and we were able to cut these
[SPEAKER_03]: nice maples prior to the bulldozer
arriving.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is out in Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had the thought that if they took
a bulldozer to the willow in their lake
[SPEAKER_03]: that they would have less willow,
which was really a bad move.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to go out and continue to
collect endless trailer loads of willow
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Maui on the side of the
volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gathering strawberry guava and
eucalyptus trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the hills we're on are so
steep that you have to use a rope to climb
[SPEAKER_03]: up them to cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Ireland, we gathered at a biomass farm,
and we gathered willow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is a way that some times we
load and get things to be brought over to
[SPEAKER_03]: the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, here's a lot of leafs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in Richmond, Virginia at a
botanic garden there, the Lewis Gunner
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanic.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are our structural pieces laying on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had loads and loads of these
smaller branches which we used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is us working on that piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was the final piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 11 pieces set in a grid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all diamond shaped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can go in the piece and then go
in further.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's kind of three levels of little
huts to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to show you something from
start to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a willow farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time you cut one of these
stools, you get twice as many sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stools are good for about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I hear you all probably know
truly, how long that lasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So willow is a great bender, but it's not
the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up and down the East Coast, lots of maple,
elm, just lots of different things that
[SPEAKER_03]: can be as usable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always have to get the materials over
to the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, the city sent a truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Talla Community Arts Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always interested in trying to build
something where people can really see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were concerned that since there are
more than leprechauns in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of crime in this particular
area outside of Dublin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were afraid somebody was going to
knock the piece down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to use this tree as a center
core for it and also to use a vernacular
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of architecture that the people there
are familiar with was this Irish round
[SPEAKER_03]: tower from the 8th to the 10th century.
[SPEAKER_03]: The monks built these enigmatic kind of
towers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was my stick tower of Talla.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 42 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this was two years later when the
piece is about to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the living limbs were outside the tree
trunk and then it just so happens that the
[SPEAKER_03]: tree had been trimmed so that it exactly
took a kind of circularity of the tower
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we were able to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another great gathering site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people here in the audience
help me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know very well where this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a great stand of sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always have the problem of hauling
those sticks back to our site.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was over in front of the Performing
Arts Center and between there and the
[SPEAKER_03]: dorm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to make a companion piece for
each one of these locust trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that we've taken and spray
painted or somebody spray painted for us
[SPEAKER_03]: so we knew where all the power lines,
electric lines and things were under
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allowed us to drill into this plaza
because they were going to replace some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the concrete anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to make a small drawing about how
each one of these seven pieces were going
[SPEAKER_03]: to interact with the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I laid out the piece by drawing a
picture, a kind of a footprint of the
[SPEAKER_03]: piece and then drilled holes wherever the
dots are there allowing us to put these
[SPEAKER_03]: structural pieces down in the ground so
that they could help hold the whole piece
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set a scaffolding system around those
uprights and then pull the shape we want
[SPEAKER_03]: over and then kind of work on a structural
crust on top of these things and start
[SPEAKER_03]: really building the sculpture from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had quite an elaborate scaffolding
system pretty high for as things go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then this was our final deal, the day of
the opening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciated all the help I had
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a fantastic crew and it really went
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to show you how I work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is at the College of Art and Design
in Savannah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the old county jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I thought about a piece for the
county jail, I thought about escape
[SPEAKER_03]: hatches and maybe flying carpets,
a way to get out of jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to show you how I work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first thing is that I work
structurally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it goes in the ground,
in this case I wove into the jail bars of
[SPEAKER_03]: the old county jail and I've got this
platform lift and I'm driving back and
[SPEAKER_03]: forth and I kind of make a structural base
so that it will hold on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like making a canvas and then
drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next phase is to kind of
aestheticize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I'm starting to come up and bring
the image up, I'm making these big
[SPEAKER_03]: circularities and I'm just hanging the
sticks on my structural base so that in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way that they look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think mainly of how it looks at this
second phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third thing is to kind of build
the cosmetics of it, to go back and to fix
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see any cut-ins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see anything that interrupts the
eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: These big white lines are whipping around
and so it thoroughly makes a kind of great
[SPEAKER_03]: illusion of movement and kind of natural
forces.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk about my work in terms of
temporary because I do temporary work and
[SPEAKER_03]: work usually one good year, maybe a pretty
good year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would say the line between trash
and treasure is very thin with sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the piece starts looking
disheveled, then it's time to take it
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pink and white dogwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've bent the branches down a little bit
at a time over several days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I built this kind of container form that
went on top of the dogwood and then it
[SPEAKER_03]: bloomed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked really pretty and then the
leaves came out on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_03]: piece and I knew that I just had three
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could only stay on there for three
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had talked to an arborist ahead of time
and so at a point it had to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, a friend of mine and I
were going to hook it to his car and drag
[SPEAKER_03]: it to the dump.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were just dragging the sculpture
right down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at Swarthmore College and the
opportunity to work on a tree that was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be taken down in two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is, because you had this
strong vertical tree with limbs on one
[SPEAKER_03]: side and no limbs on the other,
you could weave into the limbs on one side
[SPEAKER_03]: and contrast it with this strong vertical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called abracadabra and it's about
45 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's its winter configuration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this, you know, some startling
takedown pictures, they had a bucket lift
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were getting up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could see, even after two years,
the thing had a bit of integrity and would
[SPEAKER_03]: have lasted a bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a piece in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some sculpture parks around the
world where you can only use natural
[SPEAKER_03]: materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time you can only get the
materials from the park in order to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it promoted a lot of sculptors trying
their hand at working with natural
[SPEAKER_03]: materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, this is Little Big Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's seeking his own reflection in this
little pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could climb up in his body and look at
his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the great things about it was
that it flooded half the year,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it gave this other kind of epic kind of
feeling to this piece, maybe some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a water sprite or something coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father-in-law is from Norway,
so he was there and he took this picture
[SPEAKER_03]: of its final demise.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hero has fallen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at Frederick Meyer Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've never been there,
it's a great place for art and plantings
[SPEAKER_03]: to go together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was my attempt at face jugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are three of them about 22 feet
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit along a window wall so that you
could see them all year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at them, they look back at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called juggernaut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was about three years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a four-foot snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came tearing down the roof and knocked
these pieces on their butts and they left
[SPEAKER_03]: them screaming in the snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, this piece was at the Botanic
Garden in Clemson, South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the first time we used living
plants within the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we planted plants in there so that they
could become a kind of talisman for what
[SPEAKER_03]: had been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the five-year mark,
some of these maples.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Botanic Gardens can offer
continuous watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can also offer somebody to go around
and kind of preen it and look at it all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they could do things that wouldn't
normally take place in a regular site.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a seven-year mark of the piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to talk about my work in
terms of drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a kind of half-permanent piece
that's in North Carolina at the North
[SPEAKER_03]: Carolina Museum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everything you do with a pencil,
you can do with a stick line.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hit a piece of paper with a
pencil, you strike it with one weight and
[SPEAKER_03]: finish off with another, leaving series of
tapered lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since sticks are tapered, they can ape
those lines and give you the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: make things that look like they're
speeding along or that they have
[SPEAKER_03]: animation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of give you the sense that
maybe this is some natural force of wind,
[SPEAKER_03]: water, or flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all just kind of a drawing style
of using X-ing and just different weights,
[SPEAKER_03]: color.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how I've masked the color of
some lines and let the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like little red sticks fall to the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I am making the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in Sheboygan, Wisconsin at their
color arts center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like this piece as much as anything
because it really explores drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pieces hang from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got big sticks that are stuck in the
superstructure of the building that are
[SPEAKER_03]: about 10 feet above the light track.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go over and move the pieces like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a red twig, dogwood, and willow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that we gathered them in
January, and we brought them inside really
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they held their color perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had these brilliant reds and
greens that really dried out and really
[SPEAKER_03]: looked beautiful during their entire time
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of skywriting, this is from
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a piece on the North Sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just simplicity plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went across the street,
gathered the sticks, brought them over,
[SPEAKER_03]: and worked them into this series of poplar
trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as an approach, you drive down the
road, you take a really sharp left,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're looking at this right square in
your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just, you know, working with
sticks allows for a lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the World Trade Center early
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, adversity sometimes can be
promoted.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Port Authority said you can use sticks
in the building as long as you don't touch
[SPEAKER_03]: the walls, the floors, or the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw these electricians using
ladders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I went down to Putnam Ladder
Company, barred a bunch of ladders,
[SPEAKER_03]: brought them up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things about working on
site is the ability to adjust the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can, you know, if you've underdone
it, you can build more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get more ladders.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've overdone it, take some ladders
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of times the success of a piece
in a public space has to do with the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriateness of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of a second look through
the ladders.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is at the Phillips Collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is three floors of sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually out on the top of the
building looking down through the oculus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like playing off these
small or mark-making with this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: large architectural line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's about 16 foot in the middle
of that stick hole there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a platform lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going up and down the three
floors and putting these sticks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times I have to work with
ongoing activities of a space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've learned to work without killing
the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it adds for a greater bit
of conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a spotter on the stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on the inside of the stairway.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking to us the entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really fun what I do and allows
for a lot of interaction with the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the Old American Craft Museum
in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing as trying to captivate this
stairway, try to activate it, try to blend
[SPEAKER_03]: these kind of whirling lines with the
lines that are evident in the
[SPEAKER_03]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to just talk a little bit
about I used volunteers in my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first it wasn't so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would partner with organizations,
use their goodwill in the community to
[SPEAKER_03]: organize the logistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first they would say, well,
we'll get you some people to help gather.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it turned out there were a lot of
closet stick gatherers around who said,
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't we help you work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so over a period of time I've gotten
really good at letting people help me and
[SPEAKER_03]: organizing the work in small bits and
pieces so people can plug into it easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really helped me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a plumber here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a electrician, a student,
a retired engineer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all came out to help me on this
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's having a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they say, well, how do these
people know what to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say, well, we've all been children
and children know everything about sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a weapon, a tool, a piece of a
wall, magic wand, musical instrument.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, all you have to do is kind
of reawaken those inkling and adults and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we always have a, make a good go of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd had too many bottles of Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was in France.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some wine drinking restaurants
all around this park.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gave me the inspiration of making
this gang of bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty tall, look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of a misty look.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at Middlebury College.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to show you this piece
because I wanted to show you how many
[SPEAKER_03]: people helped me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this piece had to be seen from the
road.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had to be able to stand up to six foot
of snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it lasted a really long
time and I was grateful to all the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that pitched in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of them cleaned leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of them moved scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of them helped me with the actual
construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a day of me being at the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are constantly talking to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the University of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, people stand around.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell you stories of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell you stories about what they like
and hate about the arts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a kind of disbelief when
you put a big pile of sticks in the yard
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're calling the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the same people that are
inviting you for dinner the day you leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that transition is part and parcel of
the success of the work that you would see
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you really didn't,
couldn't believe is going to turn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as the illusion builds and people
are more friendly to it and finally really
[SPEAKER_03]: accepting and defending of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes there's impromptu parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we pull this away, this was in
New Harmony, we moved our scaffolding out
[SPEAKER_03]: to the street and people came running out
of the barbershop with their faces half
[SPEAKER_03]: shaved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stopped their cars right in the
middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody came in this little place,
came over to see what it really looked
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a certain amount of fear about
approaching us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had five students helping from on the
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we pulled the things away,
everybody came for a look, see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, this is in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's raining the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the students there are very stalwart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no matter what you do, people are going
to come and see you in the rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece at the Morton Arboretum in Chicago
and constantly talking to people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: walking up to the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk about my work finally in
three ways because I've worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: architecture, contrasting contemporary
architecture with ancient ways of working.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the DeCordova and Lincoln
Mast.
[SPEAKER_03]: My idea about this was a tower falling
back to its origin as a surf hut or
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps a haystack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, of course, you know, they weren't
that happy about me getting up on the
[SPEAKER_03]: roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided that I would build a mockup of
the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roof is 70 feet up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked it up with a crane and set it on
there like a dunce cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had to get up there because
the line quality didn't look that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked too insignificant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to get up there and build the
line quality up using this platform lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you always start out being safe on
the platform lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you really need to work on
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say to the guy, would you just hold my
belt for a minute?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just crawl right out on the
outside of it and get over there and do
[SPEAKER_03]: what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see we did make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was in Florida at the Hollywood
Art and Culture Center, a kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction between insect life and this
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I try to build sculptures that
don't interfere with ongoing activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a piece that I finished for Max
Asri.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clothing store on Melrose Avenue in
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were talking to me about doing
something for the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, well, this is about cloth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make some paisley cloth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I ended up covering this building
pretty profoundly with all these flying
[SPEAKER_03]: bits of sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second thing I've done is I've
worked with trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used trees as a matrix on which to
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: This tree is 400 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was planted the day this little temple
was built in which I was staying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oftentimes in Japan, the sacred trees
in these gardens have a little right ice
[SPEAKER_03]: rope around them to signify them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that gave me the idea of putting
this kind of welcoming cornucopia around
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of ancient tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it was pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used the verge and all of the sticks and
so forth on there and these bamboos to
[SPEAKER_03]: hold it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: These kids came to visit me, put them up
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a piece using Lelandia in
England.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these Lelandia hedges look solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you walk inside, just inside their
curtain, you see these huge architectural,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful cathedral-like spaces in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm trying to feature those spaces
by putting skylights in there and weaving
[SPEAKER_03]: these big chambers inside the bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of how you get in the
Warren.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go in further and then,
you know, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece that was in a tree in Birmingham,
Alabama at the museum there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times if you put something in
a tree, unless you put something low down,
[SPEAKER_03]: people won't read up the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't look up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but if you go inside this building,
you see it's three floors up and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: quite an elaborate thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought the tree limbs of trees nearby
together and wove over them, kind of build
[SPEAKER_03]: this roller coaster for squirrels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've also used the overtones of trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, not just the tree
themselves, but let the tree suggest and
[SPEAKER_03]: have an interplay with the sculpture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was down in Savannah and using this
live oak tree and the sense of mothering
[SPEAKER_03]: by all of these bigger limbs above the
small limbs and having all the moss and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff drop down onto this little
architectural folly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Hawaii, this monkey pod tree,
one of my favorite trees, is just one leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using the trunk itself as a kind of a
model for how to make these pieces work
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go up and work themselves
like bookends over the limbs and into,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a piece in New Harmony, Indiana,
you saw that when people got excited and
[SPEAKER_03]: ran over there, but this was, it's more
formal view.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, it's a hornbeam hedge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was a lot of room up under
the hedge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gave me the idea of building this kind
of cliff dwelling up underneath the hedge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see how successful it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the winter, it has all this verticality
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got really great contrast between
winter and summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right in the, on the commons in this
little town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using a tree to help hold the heads up of
these things called trail heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, they're about 35 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, each head uses one,
one tree to hold it up and a kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: elaborate shoulder system to go inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, the third thing that I've done
sometimes there's no trees to work into.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no architecture to glom onto.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to make things that stand in
a certain place.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in Brittany.
[SPEAKER_03]: I built a kind of an earth saving turtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the world on its back and a kind
of elaborate thing, but it had to stand
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used the saplings that go in the
ground to make a big stabilized situation
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was a place that I was working
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kind of a place, an estate that the
state owns and has turned into an art
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was at the Morris Arboretum in
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it started out as a snail shell
from my garden and then it became a layer
[SPEAKER_03]: cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I said, no, it's a Japanese 14th
century hairstyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, I said, no, it's Dr. Shavago in
the summer palace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have lots of thoughts about things as
I move and kind of organize my thoughts as
[SPEAKER_03]: I build something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece that I made as a private
commission in North Carolina that has just
[SPEAKER_03]: come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called it Hocus Pocus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to call it the... But anyway,
I wanted you to look inside and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to call it the Petticoat
Palace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I couldn't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you can see that this is
nothing but sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no wires.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no string.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an infernal power of the sticks
to tangle that's holding this big piece
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I have to work inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to make things that stand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't touch the walls or be
supported.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called sleepwalking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's based on a kind of a tripod look
kind of thing, kind of elaborate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece at Purdue that's still up that
maybe just has come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was based on these serpent mounds
that the first peoples in the Ohio Valley
[SPEAKER_03]: built.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is looking at it from the top
of the building.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just such a great piece to
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece at Bowdoin College.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned to hook things together at
the waist to fight the potential of
[SPEAKER_03]: weather and deep snow to push something
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you have to make something
that can stand up under the conditions of
[SPEAKER_03]: the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece is up at Winthrop right now in
South Carolina, Winthrop University.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's outside of a performing arts center
called Ain't Misbehaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's five faces that look down different
streets, look different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece that was at the Museum of Glass
and using kind of imagery that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: made in glass or clay and extending that
image using the reflection in the pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted to show you how many
people would come to see a sculpture
[SPEAKER_03]: burned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fire prone there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're druids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the whole county came.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they knew one year before that they
were going to set it on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made after the Kalanish Standing
Stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, you can see the scale on
these pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were made from willow that was
collected from this farm that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was that fatal night.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the next morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a sculpture looks like when
it's gone, vaporized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these guys had the nerve to cook
their breakfast on my sculpture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any time?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I rushed through that so we'd have a
few minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey listen, we're working down at the site
this afternoon over at the Children's
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to pull off a workshop
on Friday where people can just come up
[SPEAKER_03]: and work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're trying to set up a smaller
thing, a little installation that people
[SPEAKER_03]: can just come work on with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be there from two to
four this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be there tomorrow from
nine to noon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow we're going to work and then
Friday all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be over at the
Children's Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to play around with sticks,
this would be a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, usually they bring a chipper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll bring a chipper at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll chip it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they try to take it away in the
night so that there's not too much
[SPEAKER_03]: controversy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to take the ones with the big
heads at the museum down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had an insurrection.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mothers from the neighborhood around
the sculpture park came in a big group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, we're going to tell the
artist on here that I am the artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're making me take it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really, really sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not without pain that some of
these things come down because people get
[SPEAKER_03]: very fond of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they need to come down while
they still look.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I rarely get to go back and look at
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see follow-up pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing how many pictures of a
piece are on the web.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can see what people think of it just
simply by going back on and Googling
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll see wraps of pictures about an
individual piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say, oh, I see it's opened up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they shouldn't have blinded me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get one great year and one pretty good
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some places, like if you have a children's
garden, the one in Sausalito onto the
[SPEAKER_03]: Brooklyn Golden Gate Bridge, there's a
nice children's museum there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kept one for seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just work on it and mess with it
and renew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turned out really pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, sticks can't last that
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just get brittle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start falling apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to use them while they're in
play.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in truth, a lot of times I think that
it's better to have a series of sculptures
[SPEAKER_03]: in a place so that you can present a lot
more ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my theory is that sculptures have
ideas embedded in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once the general public has looked
and come to accommodate those ideas,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sculpture becomes less interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having a raft or a number of
sculptures, one right after another every
[SPEAKER_03]: several years, really allows for a lot
more thinking and more provocative
[SPEAKER_03]: interplay with the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start out by pulling the shape with
rope.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then as we go, we cut it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just holds itself together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no twig or ropes or anything in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better if it's thorough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has more kind of substance and validity
to it if we can build something that is
[SPEAKER_03]: thoroughly sticks, that holds itself up,
that has inherent method of joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really good shots,
like pictures in that slideshow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you take most of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you just kind of collect them from
the internet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have an agreement with my sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I do is I ask the sites to take
the photos because they need them too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photographer has their copyright.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sign the right for us to use them any
way we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's never been just one photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been numerous photographers.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, I think that some artists
believe that they can take the best shot
[SPEAKER_03]: of their work, that no one else can see it
like they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: My theory is that I don't use a camera
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not really thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more in my mind what I think it
should look like, not what it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having somebody that is realistic about
what they think they can get in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: an image has turned out to be more
satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that they do a good job of
capturing the idea of the piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether they can capture the real essence
of the piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is photos only go so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you see a photo of a piece
and then you go and experience one,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see how lacking the photo is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just documents something and allows me
to get more work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the only way to get the
sense of the piece is just to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: experience it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have the associations that it might
promote in you when you're talking through
it and thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seeing how it really has a reciprocity
with its site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing how it works with the whole site
and the scale of the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started out with clay and my
dissatisfaction with clay is that I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to further process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted to work large.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was building these really huge large
things in clay and then trying to fire
them and this is not working out.
But this is another kind of green work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has got the flexibility, the
pliability of working with clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of fundamental and can be
taken from the site just like clay was
[SPEAKER_03]: often taken from the sky by early peoples
and used on this fire over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the source of it is right over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like that connection with site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I like the way that you can mark
clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hit it and mark it easily when
it's in its wet state?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing is that it translates
to all this mark making that you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: on the surfaces of these big stick pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering what your view is or
idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's fast and furious at the
children's garden because it's really not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a workshop in which other
people get a chance to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to set out something.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted something that kids could
ultimately use and go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we settled on a grouping of five kind
of shapes that were interacting with
[SPEAKER_03]: tunnels that go between them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out there's a big bunch of
pumpkins that are sitting on the site that
[SPEAKER_03]: will make absolutely great models as the
people come help us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, look at those and see what we can
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how we can bend these shapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're first starting and people
haven't really worked with sticks at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't give them too big of a task.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to have simple shapes to work
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are very simple pumpkin shapes
that we've derived because these pumpkins
[SPEAKER_03]: were on our site and they're looking
really pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think your work is so accessible
physically that you can enter the work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you spend as much time
[SPEAKER_01]: on these things?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think there needs to be a consistent
line logic between inside and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you walk into them, you realize
that you're kind of walking in and the
[SPEAKER_03]: lines are carrying you in and they're
finishing up on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I use volunteers, a lot of their
work is really on the inside of these
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an enormous amount of detailing work
to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've got to think cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to think the safety of these
pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't have jagged stick all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to have a smooth, beautiful,
flowing interior as well so that people
[SPEAKER_03]: can use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think a lot of these pieces would
look nice as they generated for the art.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a beautiful look at their
generation or process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just have to be careful because in
public, the public is not as forgiving as
[SPEAKER_03]: an individual might be in seeing entropy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might think, yeah, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first person to see it, they have
giant pile of dirt and sticks down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it doing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just leave it up to my sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want those things to go to dust,
they can do it if they would feel like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even me, having people shame them for
having to clean this up and fell down.
But I also think I can hear from the edges
that there's another class that's trying
to miss.
So what I might suggest we do is have
Patrick move up to the outside and please
continue the conversation.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
