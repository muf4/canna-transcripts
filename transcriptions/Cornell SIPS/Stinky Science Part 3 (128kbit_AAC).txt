[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's other stuff going on here,
and what we're hoping to learn this time
[SPEAKER_00]: is when does the plant make the switch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is sequential from being a
female to being a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see what's inside of this you'll
see hundreds of really small florets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't each have petals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just little sex organs,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the male and female expression is
separated by 24 hours, or maybe it isn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's separated by some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens in almost all chamber
flowers is the pollinator enters first,
[SPEAKER_00]: presumably with pollen from the last
flower it visited, because they get fooled
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they rub against the female organs of
the flowers, which are receptive first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing the plant does is we'll
take the pollen that you've got on your
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies and we'll fertilize our ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens in the first five minutes of
anything entering here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what they do is they hold those
pollinators captive overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They warm up the chamber, which gives them
a nice energetic reward, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it protects them against predators,
because most of their predators don't
[SPEAKER_00]: follow them into chambers like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the morning they shower them
with their own pollen, or make them walk
[SPEAKER_00]: past the male flowers, which are now
finally mature, on their way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go do it again the next
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you would think this must be harming
these insects, because after a while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to miss out on chances to
lay eggs, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them do die in the chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dead horse Arum in Sardinia and
Corsica has a bad habit of killing its
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, most of the insects
that do this for a living mate multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times, and they mate on the dead bodies,
or on the cow patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they do in that chamber sometimes
is make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rewards that they're not getting
nectar and pollen to eat like other
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're getting is a warm place out
of the rain, away from predators,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a chance to maybe get a second mating
or a third mating, and then do it again
[SPEAKER_00]: the following night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are so rare that they're
not going to wipe out a population of
[SPEAKER_00]: blowflies, which are, as most people know,
very abundant, and breed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my cat brings mice or voles into our
house, we've got blowflies in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how they get into the house,
but they find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good at doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are opportunists.

Thank you.
Thank you.
