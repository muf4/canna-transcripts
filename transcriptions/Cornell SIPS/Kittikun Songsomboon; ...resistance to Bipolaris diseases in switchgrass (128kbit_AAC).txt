[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, thank you Rochelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good afternoon everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have we have two research about
breeding for disease-resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's start with my non-edible
switchgrass first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research, my research is to improve
switchgrass population to be resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases caused by bipares or rye seed and
today I would like to introduce you what
[SPEAKER_00]: is switchgrass because I don't think many
of you know well about switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you know switchgrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally touched switchgrass before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty itchy though and and I'm gonna
I'm gonna tell you about background of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease that I'm working on, the progress
of the selections of those diseases and
[SPEAKER_00]: the correlation between the the resistance
of two diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is me with switchgrass and
switchgrass is pretty new newly
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just domesticated just only less
than a hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have like lots of diversity in
switchgrass and it was only about like one
[SPEAKER_00]: decades ago that we use it for that
Department of Energy has selected
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass as a biomass energy crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically switchgrass was just grown to
like proposed to be the plan for producing
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity like and also can convert it
to ethanol in the future in the when that
[SPEAKER_00]: when the gas pride is pretty high and not
not this time but maybe in the near future
[SPEAKER_00]: and you may think that hey in these
pictures like the switchgrass is even like
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than me and like not that good in
terms of the yield in these pictures but
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this picture it was taken in around
Penn State University and this area it's
[SPEAKER_00]: proposing to be an ideal area for planting
switchgrass because it's a marginal land
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that no other crop can make
any any good yield based on this in this
[SPEAKER_00]: land like in this in this area is a my
claimed area which means that like nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: cares about that land and switchgrass was
pushed to plant it in that low marginal
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and most of the research that has been
done in switchgrass it's focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the yield and other agronomic
traits but very few just only couples of
[SPEAKER_00]: research has been proposed about the
disease resistant in the switchgrass even
[SPEAKER_00]: though the one of the disease that can
reduce the yield up to 50% of biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a whole world of switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can if you reduce the biomass of
switchgrass like switchgrass is nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: for you so these diseases caused by
Bipers-Oraxi have a significant not only
[SPEAKER_00]: for in the yield reduction but also it can
reduce the germination which switchgrass
[SPEAKER_00]: is a perennial crop so the first year
establishment is very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass if it can reduce the
germination which it means that it reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: a biomass that you can get for many years
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my breeding program I am working
with up to upland switchgrass shelter and
[SPEAKER_00]: cave in rock and based on that two
diseases Bipers or Bipers leaf spot and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bipers seed rot I separate into I separate
them into like two distinct part distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program and I'll read done done
the two cycle of selection based on those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and I'm gonna continue the third
cycle of selection based on Bipers seed
[SPEAKER_00]: rot and you will see that why I'm keep
continuing this and on based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: second cycle of selection I taste the
reciprocal taste to see the correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move to the first resistant the
resistant to Bipers leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically I just sprayed inoculum on the
four seedlings and cover it with a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic bag for 24 hours, release it and
leave it for seven days and evaluate the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease based on the percent lesions on
the leaves and because these disease has
[SPEAKER_00]: very few study previously so I didn't know
like the genetic that control background
[SPEAKER_00]: that control this trait before so before
you jump in in general before you jump in
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding anything you should have a
background of these how is this this is
[SPEAKER_00]: heritable so I I wanted to calculate the
heritability before I made any selection
[SPEAKER_00]: so I produce a half zip seeds of the
lowland type of callow in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: because I cannot produce the seeds in the
field in Ithaca to call and I produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: half zip seeds of the callow and shelter
in the field and and surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding them by the Salkam Sudan to
produce a to read to prevent the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination between the plots but sadly
the heritability aren't based on these
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent to Bipers leaf spot is
significantly like non-significant or zero
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that I may not expect any gain
from selection on this but I still hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that okay after two cycle of selection I
should get some gain of the selection but
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly it's I didn't get any gain from the
selection from from these two like two
[SPEAKER_00]: years of cycle selection so the why exit
is percent the severity the the higher the
[SPEAKER_00]: bar the more susceptible it is so the
lower the more resistant but across the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle 0 1 2 here there's no like
significantly improvement on this so I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get any significant gain from that
or like significant realize heritability
[SPEAKER_00]: which mean that I like the 50% of my PhD
time that has already devoted to this has
[SPEAKER_00]: like nothing so I so I step back and I
didn't cry but I step back and like try to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the bigger pictures like okay I
made like things like too narrow to just
[SPEAKER_00]: like few culture bar that I tasted only
like couple culture bar so last year I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to access to the association
panel which is a which consists of five
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and nine switch grader has been
genotyped already and it was transplanted
[SPEAKER_00]: in in Ithaca last year so I have the
chance to to went to the field and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: few evaluations just roughly and as it
shows in the segregation then and I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see like some variation in in the
lowland type and upland types which grass
[SPEAKER_00]: so based on these results I really hope I
get significant peak from genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association analysis but again no
significant heat from this even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: QQ plot shows it's like chose no
significant at the end here like so so I
[SPEAKER_00]: would try my last year of my PhD now focus
in this summer to try to phenotype this
[SPEAKER_00]: trade again by now like detached the leaf
from the field and put it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: green in the lab and spread it evaluate
the disease later so I have five minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: left moving on to something something
impressive I have another disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant do you remember the disease
resistant to bipolar which basically I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't expect much about this so best
because I just soaked the seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interest water and tween as a control
compare with the the seeds with the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment which is a inoculum and based on
that I collected today the database on
[SPEAKER_00]: dominates or not zero and one so based on
that comparison I can also calculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: percent domination reduction which I can
turns out that I can calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability based on half seat how
however the way that I make a selection I
[SPEAKER_00]: make only like selection based on
individual plants that is germinate from
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment one so I need to find a way
to calculate the half seat heritability
[SPEAKER_00]: based on individual selection and I found
a way to fit the model in binomial model
[SPEAKER_00]: and luckily I get pretty impressive like
moderate to high heritability based on
[SPEAKER_00]: half seat selection range from point six
eight to point nine in each different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars and let's focus on the
individual selection here that I get in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Rock that I make a selection I had
the point three heritability and which is
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also significant heritability so
I I really have my last hope in my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: program that it may work and it and this
result is it showing the progress of my
[SPEAKER_00]: selection the X axis is percent
germination and each pairs of the of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bar representing each cycle of selection
on your left hand side it's a Kevin Rock
[SPEAKER_00]: and your right hand side is a shelter so
let's focus on the parental line parental
[SPEAKER_00]: generation the cycle zero you will see
that the blue bar which is a control one
[SPEAKER_00]: has high significantly higher germination
than the red bar which is a percent
[SPEAKER_00]: domination of the treatment one which is
consistent with a shelter here also it is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different however with it
within only one cycle of selection I can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce that gap between the blue bar and
red bar to non significantly different and
[SPEAKER_00]: based on that and based on this gap
between the blue bar and red bar I plot
[SPEAKER_00]: the next graph which Y axis represent the
percent germination reduction however I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see I didn't see any significant
progress in Kevin Rock from cycle zero one
[SPEAKER_00]: and two but you see that the trend is
reducing which means it's more resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to the disease when we consider the
shelter one from the non the the parental
[SPEAKER_00]: line the reduction percent reduction is
pretty high but only one cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: selection it totally reduce that that one
to to improve that a lot so based on that
[SPEAKER_00]: I calculate I can I get a significant gain
from from from this trade up to like 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent like in one cycle of selection
which I need to repeat that I already
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat a couple times but I need to repeat
it again but it's pretty impressive only
[SPEAKER_00]: one cycle of selection can can do that and
I would I wanted to to compare with my
[SPEAKER_00]: individual best heritability but because
of the the trade is only zero and one I
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot I cannot calculate the realize
heritability based on that so I found a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to to calculate the liability
heritability and you see here at point
[SPEAKER_00]: four it's pretty close to point three that
I calculate earlier which means that okay
[SPEAKER_00]: I got pretty like consistent results from
this selection and and now let's compare
[SPEAKER_00]: these two resistant as you as I presented
to you earlier I didn't get any impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: great gain from resistant to leaf spot
that's all flat here but you see the trend
[SPEAKER_00]: in resistant to seed rot here it's some
improvement here some improvement here
[SPEAKER_00]: which and so based on this data I can
calculate the correlation between the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant and as as a graph suggests
there's no correlation it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-significant here which which can
explain that the mechanism behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant are different which makes sense
right the the resistant in seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant in seedlings a different stage
so it has no correlation so in summary due
[SPEAKER_00]: to the low and non-significant for the
resistant to vibrate leaf spot I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get any gain and from selection and this
year I'm gonna try the US analysis again
[SPEAKER_00]: like improving my phenotyping in the field
again and I hope I can come up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism behind that some significant
peak behind that and based on moderate to
[SPEAKER_00]: high heritability of the resistant to
vibrate seed rot I get pretty in although
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the significant gain in
cabin rot but I I get pretty impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: significant gain in shelter and we I'll
continue the selection of the third cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: again based on the different trends in
this resistant I I we get like
[SPEAKER_00]: non-significant correlation between these
two traits so thank you for all of my life
[SPEAKER_00]: and thank you for your attention very
welcome for any questions or suggestion
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so I calculate the broadsand
heritability and even the broadsand is
[SPEAKER_00]: only 0.3 for that so I need and and
because last year it was not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: representative year because it's a it's
pretty dry and it's not a like it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: good for my disease to occur in the field
and also the plant was so small it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just transplanted so it's like these sites
and compared to like these side of
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass that it should be so yeah so
it's ranges from data ploy to octa ploy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the one that I make the selection is
all octa ploy so it may like have some
[SPEAKER_00]: like like difficulty in terms of like
pushing those genetics oh I so this I try
[SPEAKER_00]: like couple of them but the one that I
present that to you I used this only are
[SPEAKER_00]: by using our block package oh the point
the point in this case is I use I try our
[SPEAKER_00]: blob and tassel because switchgrass
although it's octa ploy and data ploy but
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a disomic segregation so we can
like use those like pathway yep thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: so much this has been a production of
