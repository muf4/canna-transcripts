[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a lot we want to do this
morning with our great guest here,
[SPEAKER_01]: the director of the Northeast Climate
Center and professor here in Earth and
[SPEAKER_01]: Atmospheric Sciences, Dr. Arti Gaetano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for taking the time to join
me and us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, I think it's not too early,
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's master's week, right,
brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of spring for every male
species that plays golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say this is a global phenomenon,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you hear people in Australia talk
about the Augusta effect that they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of like become a cultural
piece of cement that we deal with in this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, much like spring lawn care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get to the videotape here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, you know, listen, the slow
coming out of the spring allows us to see
[SPEAKER_01]: poa annua in its glory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These perennial types on the old poa
putting green greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what a walking around on a golf
course in the spring is is all about to
[SPEAKER_01]: really enjoy this and see the diversity
that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by summertime, you can't tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a uniform stand of grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, I thought I'd draw, you know,
I like to show a picture every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while of things going good and make things
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do this during the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always tried to have a picture,
make somebody smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's somebody out at Sahale with his
daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took this picture, Carl,
because I got a guy wearing those DG
[SPEAKER_01]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying who wears these shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a guy in the Pacific Northwest
that wears these shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I also also always love a good pet
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Tyler Warner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Tyler at all, but he lost
Brutus recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just love how he says it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is as emotional as money guys get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang dogs are so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just something about a dog in
this business that makes everybody smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our we had our really well attended
shortcut conference call this week,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we've been doing for the last 29 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the docket was mole and vole
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more snow cover than usual left a
lot of places with some surface scarring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in good term, we say, get out and
roll the darn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that lawn smoothed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you have grub damage, just roll
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if the soil is in good shape and
the grass was growing good, just roll it
[SPEAKER_01]: down, get it smooth and then throw some
seed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really isn't any more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we get to Carl, you two setting
art up for our conversation today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just do a little bit for the week and
tie it into some of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: heard as observations across the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Art said to us earlier in the maps
from the forecast website, that anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: can access, you know, cooler to the north,
warmer to the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that we're necessarily
falling behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we're pretty close to normal in
most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils, you know, have made an interesting
turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was soils last week where we had very
few soils in the fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it is this week, really seeing a
few more many much more widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: fifties, higher forties and fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things warmed up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I asked you about the soil
stuff, because things really moved at the
[SPEAKER_01]: two inch level pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this I mean, this is a time of year
where we really see the soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially at two inches, move around a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tied to the air temperature in
some some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about us being on roller
coasters in terms of of the air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some lag.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some, you know, there's some
buffer in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But particularly at this time of year,
you know, when we're going from the
[SPEAKER_02]: thirties to the seventies in terms of air
temperature, you see the soil start to
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're here, we're chatting about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the wild card in this thing is
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does the moisture then affect
that swing at this time of year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the moisture makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot easier to heat up soil when
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not heating up all that water in
the soil and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the moisture plays a huge role actually
at this time of year.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you look at growth,
right, Carl, and I'm sort of setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: some other things that we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take into account temperature
and moisture, as you're doing with our
[SPEAKER_01]: growth growth potential here and you look
at the New York metropolitan area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you still see we're really not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's greening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The landscape is greening and for city is
starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hearing reports of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, big disparities between the
east end of Long Island and where Walt
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson is up in the Adirondacks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like living in two different
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important to understand,
you know, when you when you do when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the forecast website, make sure it's
localized for your location or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for some other location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we've talked about before,
we had a really dry fall, historically
[SPEAKER_01]: warm and dry fall, and that left a lot of
grass looking pretty bad already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the even, you know, because we're
not growing, we might be green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in this image we've got a few
things that are green, but more things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are brown that have not recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things we talked about,
I think, this is worthy of some mention is
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a lot of first time homeowners,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it isn't necessarily the best
time to get a home, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: buying homes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The economy seems to be plugging along.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time homeowners are very anxious to
sort of get after it and do some
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosing of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing they run to is a soil
test, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, you know, I will say this image,
these images in this image is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: AI generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and except for the rims, it's a
ribbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to say is, you know,
you can go and test your soil and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people will do it for chemical purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend that you just take a put it
in your finger, make yourself a ribbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, if you get a really long ribbon means
you've got a lot of clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little trickier to grow
grass and add a whole more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can be difficult if you walk on it
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the other end, if you can't
even put it together, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be more sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may need more water to grow some grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding those physical
properties and how the moisture you add is
[SPEAKER_01]: much more important than the nutrients you
add in most cases really helps you solve
[SPEAKER_01]: this and sort of break us out of the soil
chemical testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then we go and we run and we do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run and we go buy products,
walk down the aisle, leave with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, as Art told us
earlier, it's going to rain this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This weekend, you know, we're looking at,
you know, at almost anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you said almost an inch and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rain art and we've got the maps and you
can see the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the forecast website and see
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a runoff model and the
runoff model indicates over the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: days that we got a moderate chance for
runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I you could look in there and see the
map and zone in on where you're at to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if this is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at a time when we tend to put a lot of
stuff on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's fertilizing in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nobody's putting weed and feed
in the summertime very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's putting insecticide down in the
lawns, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a particular time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're understanding runoff risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, again, the great climate work
that happens over in the climate center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we also have this pollinator risk
assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're running out there putting
products out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got a model that's looking at
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure we're starting to see some of
these dandelion flowers and early spring
[SPEAKER_01]: ephemerals come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was this was this is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it's going to be like in
another seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the forecast website gives us this
opportunity to see where we are now and
[SPEAKER_01]: also see the risk if when you're going to
plan what you're going to do for the
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, Carl, here we go in on the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we've sort of I would
almost say are we didn't pioneer the sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of study of it, but we certainly pioneered
the idea of using it to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a visual way, looking at maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the first one after this and
bringing in a lot of data and bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of data, a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so here we have our two seed head
control recommendations that we base on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are base 32 growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our dandelion recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are base 50 that starts at March
15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to leave it there,
Carl, because we have predictive models
[SPEAKER_01]: that use growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your question for Art today is about
growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this can I pass it to you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and one thing you guys have talked on
the show before is when should we start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree days and and Art,
what you've said in the past is you sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of turned it back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when do you think it matters to a
crabgrass seed that's going to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: or a bluegrass weevil that's going to
start marching over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's if we get 20 base 32 degree
days in February 10th, does that mean
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided I'm going to look at a
little bit of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Art's talking about a lot of data on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 14 years in Ithaca, New York,
2005 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just looked at how we accumulate
those growing degree days base 32 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those watching right now,
you can see this is if we start March 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a forecast website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we throw out, there's two outlier
years that are really early or really
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, we can expect to hit the
200 growing degree day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about when we start thinking about
proxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: About when we start thinking about
crabgrass pre-ease or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about a month bracket in there
where we may hit that 200 growing degree
[SPEAKER_00]: day mark between March 24th and April 18th
in Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I decided, OK, you know,
we thought, OK, the spring is warming with
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we start maybe February 15th?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually what the Michigan
State degree degree trade tracker does is
[SPEAKER_00]: they start February 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that change how we make our actions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this now you can see it's a little bit
more scattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, if we bracket getting rid of
those outlier years, it's the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: date, March 24th to April 18th,
about a month in there where we hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 going degree mark where we start
thinking about doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one is art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right is, hey, it might
actually not matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's point number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And point number two, as you can see in
some of these early years when we
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate stuff in February, these sort
of flat lines, these stalling years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly what you're saying,
Art, is we accumulate some growing degree
[SPEAKER_00]: days and then we're cold for five days,
10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to us, that probably doesn't matter
biologically or to weeds or to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is rationale from you,
Art, is like, I think we're still good
[SPEAKER_00]: with our March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's where I mean,
I think location matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you looked at Michigan,
but I wonder what this would look like
[SPEAKER_02]: someplace down in Virginia or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your your graphs show actually
quite nicely up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the northeast, March, March 1st is
fine, except for maybe an outlier year
[SPEAKER_02]: here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of that, those plateaus,
I guess that's where I'm the meteorologist
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're the biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, does does a seed or does an
insect kind of put those degree days in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bank and they're able to pull on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are they there there or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we oftentimes I think we I
think sometimes and this may be an
[SPEAKER_01]: overgeneralization, but I think sometimes
when we stall and then you know how it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: light switch sometimes where it's boom,
it was cold and then boom, it's 85 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get in a warm rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this what feels like a rebound
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like like you just said, it's storing it
up, Art, and it's waiting and it responds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if it's responding
because it stored it up or because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: flipping a switch and the next day it's
just 80 degrees and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: physiologically ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said, it's green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly has the solar panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the solar panels to collect the
sunlight and turn it into energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the conditions aren't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, does it store it or you
know, this is a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but here's this is the other thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is how big the window is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only when we start hitting
that 200 degree day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, if you want to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how many days we're spending in sort
of the time we have to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hundred to five hundred is what our
proxy window is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting late if we're we're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making that app beyond five hundred
about the same for crabgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the chart I think most people
care about, especially landscapers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have hundreds, maybe thousands of
properties where it takes two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks maybe to make an application
of pre emergent herbicide to all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have longer time spent in that
window, if it's generally cooler in that
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree threshold, I can get to all
my properties and get pretty good timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a shorter window and I am really
warm and I blow through those degree days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough time to get to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a general range in Ithaca,
New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do I spend in that in that sort
of ideal application window?
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, it's about 20, 21 days,
19 days, three ish weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's maybe just enough if you're a
landscape or get into all your properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the short end, the really warm year,
you blow through that in 13 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008, 2018, 2023 were really warm years in
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had very little time to make those
apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years, 2020, 2016, you had 30,
33 days spent in that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big, that's three times as
long really as the shortest year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is interesting, Carl, because you
said location matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up in Ithaca, centrally isolated
up here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were in Jersey where our brother,
Rich Buckley is, or even where our turf
[SPEAKER_01]: programs in Virginia Tech are,
do you think this window's narrower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't say that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as narrow as you get further south.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew you were going there and I was
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you set it up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My intuition is the window will not get
much narrower as you go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you go south, what the window will do
is move earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the width of that window is really
going to change quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I hesitate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see the warm up coming a little
bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you even think of what we've been
having lately with these warm spells where
[SPEAKER_02]: we get up here in upstate, we might get up
into the 60s, upper 60s and think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I call down to my family in New
Jersey or Philly, they're up in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are accumulating a lot more degree
days there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might affect things in some years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think overall, I'd expect to see the
same window size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting, Carl, because this is a
knowable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could sit there and ask the machine a
simple question like, on average,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the ideal time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this window and your window is
from when it starts to when it's not any
[SPEAKER_01]: good anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this period of time where it's
ideal, which is maybe its own range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this ideal or this is just it'll work
if you put it down at this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ideal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and if you bracket on the ends and
marginal, we could also look at that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you start thinking about,
as Randy tells us all the time or early
[SPEAKER_01]: down, early gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at a pre, that doesn't
last as long because you put it out early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what we don't know is how much
degradation or movement of it happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring as soils warm and things break
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but we know they don't last more than
10, 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these pre-emergence, maybe
barricade could be 14 or longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going with team like a
homeowner might be doing, that one's only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get to six or seven, maybe eight
weeks of crabgrass control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crabgrass pressures well into July
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're you're going to see the grass
burn out by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this window becomes more important for
something that wears out like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: less important for a proxy because you
just need to hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of these guys, this is a follow
up spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're locking in seedhead
suppression in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole nother area study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Carl, listen, we've sort of I think
concluded here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talked earlier that the grass
isn't growing, but yet every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they see it's green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Belichick, we found out this week,
is ripping out synthetic turf to put
[SPEAKER_01]: natural grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the guy that ripped out natural
grass in the middle of the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: got himself in some trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started playing on synthetic
turf in New England.
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently Dr. Belichick there has
changed his tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, Carl, these multipurpose surfaces
have a role as we've talked about in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get in the summertime,
it starts to cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Art, you also have experience of this
both in your meteorological world and in
[SPEAKER_01]: your world as a soccer ref.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to want to draw on that,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start with the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when everybody thinks about
synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, if it warms up,
it's actually a good thing, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: for us when we need it in the shoulders of
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this image is just showing 89.2
Celsius is what some synthetic systems can
[SPEAKER_00]: get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's 170 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting to a really crazy number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water boils at 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it ain't too far off from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Art, I was reviewing some of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: High solar absorptivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go back to that slide,
yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two primary factors of why is it
so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: High solar absorptivity and water
evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, Art, from a physics perspective,
you could just explain those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy, Art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a few Penn State people listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can dumb it down then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, actually, the physics isn't all
that complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this in my Intro to Physics class,
actually, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl kind of hits it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the incoming solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the energy coming into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that energy comes in,
I would say three things can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can reflect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it can evaporate water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the reflectivity of natural
grass and synthetic turf is probably about
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you get a big difference
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you do do is, I mean,
the absorptivity goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The darker the surface is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know what Carl's next slide is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those darker surfaces absorb a lot of
solar energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they absorb it, they have to do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things is increase their
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing they can do is evaporate
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're taking a system that no
longer evapotranspirates, you have more of
[SPEAKER_02]: that energy going into upping the
temperature, as opposed to evaporating
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things we've
learned, Frank, is these systems are
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flush the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't hold any water, which is great
for playing on the field all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not great from a storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storm water perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we're going to, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say it's not rocket science,
right, Frank?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actual rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are absorptivity coefficients of
various black coatings they can put on
[SPEAKER_00]: rockets and white coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high numbers on the left,
0.8, 0.9, is how much of that solar
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation it holds versus white coatings,
0.3, 0.1, 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just the physics around a
black, a dark surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to hold more of that
absorptivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the background, we have a black
synthetic field that was put in at
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrisville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ari, we were just talking before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have refed on this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a ref, sort of setting aside your
expertise as a climate scientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: what were your thoughts when you were
refing a game on this field?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always want it to be a cloudy day when I
go to Morrisville, basically, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: sucks when it's sunny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, even going late in the season,
I know this past season, I refed up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was end of October, basically,
at least mid-October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bright, sunny day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the air temperature was wonderful off
the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the field, it was just hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is, as a high school ref,
I looked in the New York State Public High
[SPEAKER_00]: School Athletic Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: They refer every sort of person
responsible for are we going to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: game or not when it comes to heat stress
to wet bulb globe temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a weather bug app that you can
go on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a little bit in the past
about wet bulb globe temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a brief primer on sort of what is
that looking at from an athlete's
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, heat stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than just the air temperature,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's been a whole progression
in these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, it was the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature humidity index that
brought in the amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really what this wet bulb globe
temperature is really brings in
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, the temperature, the humidity,
the wind speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most importantly, the solar
radiation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you think of a nice sunny day up
here in spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels pretty good when it's 60
degrees out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't feel the same on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the body absorbing that solar energy,
just like the synthetic turf, actually
[SPEAKER_02]: helps quite a bit in that temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this the feels like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's the feels like temperature on
steroids, Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of it's the extension of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so so all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the New York State Public High
School Athletic Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming the NCAA's got another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this work in practical terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you confronted this in any way where
because let me just step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've chatted with some people who manage
natural grass fields in the south and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic fields in the south,
and they got this rule down there and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've never canceled the game on
synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to for the record,
while this is there, I wonder how it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually gets implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not implemented, you know,
because everybody wants to get the game
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with rain on a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get the game in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how does this actually happen in
practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had high school games either
canceled or delayed because of the New
[SPEAKER_02]: York State rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically there again, it's kind of
it's the athletic director at the field
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at his phone to the weather bug
app and telling, you know, weather bug in
[SPEAKER_02]: this city is saying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're either delaying the
start of the game if it's close or we're
[SPEAKER_02]: canceling the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally that call.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a college game canceled
because of the heat, although I've
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely been out there on some very,
very hot days, you know, standing at
[SPEAKER_02]: midfield before the game at the National
Anthem and basically just sweating like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not familiar with what the NCAA
rule is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in a lot of cases the game will go
and we'll have more frequent water breaks
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that in professional soccer as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to my knowledge, there's not a cutoff
like in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this is this a good metric art?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we were going to pursue this and
you were an athletic field manager,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at a university or at a really
nice high school where there's high
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations and you've got one of these
carpets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is more likely something,
as Carl said, they'll encounter when they
[SPEAKER_01]: get back in August for play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarely are we worried about this thing up
North because actually it's desirable now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where you can get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering about, is this a good
measure of what you think is simple enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also actually protecting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some kind of measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I think this might go astray a
little bit is it goes back to natural
[SPEAKER_02]: versus artificial turf, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these measurements, measurements
you're getting from Wailerbug and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, they're clearly not over
artificial turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most of those measurements are
coming from at least something that's in a
[SPEAKER_02]: more favorable environment to produce a
cooler temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are, you know, that that skews
things quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, really there should be,
you know, if you wanted to do this the
[SPEAKER_02]: right way, there should be some special
on-site type measurements of doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could be also something that if
you got enough data from different fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could model just like you do
everything else, right, Art?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, again, it's just not the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Carl started off with 80 degrees
C at the turf surface and looked like he
[SPEAKER_02]: was showing that from an infrared
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right there at the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, maybe you could find egg,
your shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet your feet are very hot on these
surfaces when you referee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now up at body level, there's a difference
and that difference is going to matter
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's a real windy day or a calm
day and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some variation even in there
within the height of a typical athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even with with the different
synthetic surfaces, right, Frank,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're learning more about alternative
infills and there's ones that purport to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold water and you will irrigate
those fields and it holds water and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get that evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably won't last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to guess, maybe maybe half an
hour or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see this on campus, right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spray there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're irrigating the at least they do to
the field hockey field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that's for ballplay, but also for
for some cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no question about it that
this remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, this is a part of
everybody that's managing natural grass
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces at a high level is magic managing
synthetic surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the nature of the people that we
service in this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what I like about this and I
think always have said about this with
[SPEAKER_01]: sports fields, sports has liability that
just about every other part of turf
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kids can get hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to your point, Art,
these laws are a little bit these
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations, a little bit more
stringent on youth fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you're younger,
you not only are you closer to the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'd say when you're a peanut,
you're spending a lot of time on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, on the ground, on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that that does bring the measurement
into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl, we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions from the field or any more
final questions from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did want to point out on this chart,
you see region one, two and three and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cutoffs for sort of low threat,
moderate threat, high threat are different
[SPEAKER_00]: for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the regions of the country you
live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, how acclimated your kids are to
heat matters in how you will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: play of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're from the south and you're
used to warmer temperatures, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: region three here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cutoff is a little bit higher because
you're used to that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up in the Adirondacks,
actually, and within New York state,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be cut into two different
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, public high school events
played in the North country would be
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to region one versus region two
for more downstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that probably
gets overlooked, but it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, in New York state, we have two
different sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would explain a little bit why,
you know, maybe games in the south aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: canceled.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your point, Carl, they may be as a
population, more more heat acclimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so listen, art, thanks for taking the
time to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's really great to have always
always fun to be with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Carl, who do we got next week?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have Evan Machete on next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be talking sports turf
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Evan is going to be one of the experts
on we're going to ask him about traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a good idea of best ways to
manage traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evan's probably one of the experts in the
entire world on using some pretty advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery to to measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be it'll be fun next week with
thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
