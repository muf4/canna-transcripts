[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do two parts of what I'm
going to share.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm just going to talk about
fruition seeds and a little bit of how we
[SPEAKER_03]: came to be and some of the questions we
ask ourselves as a young startup seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to spend a little bit
of time talking about some of our breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: work and selection work actually within
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Lauren said, we started about five
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: My partner Petra is the one with really
the seed background.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a lifelong seed saver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably about 10 years ago,
started thinking about starting a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had been farming for a while and
always had been saving seeds and felt like
[SPEAKER_03]: she wanted to really invest all of her
energy in seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So started working on seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed farms and for seed companies on the
East Coast and the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we bumped into each other at a
dance in Ithaca, actually, about six years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few months later, we started a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not necessarily a reluctant
entrepreneur, but I've never thought of
[SPEAKER_03]: myself as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I've started several
companies and ran several projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing that trajectory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just started a fruition of the
sea about five minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be starting to breed kelp.
[SPEAKER_03]: After Charles's presentation, I am hooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually grew up in Old Saybrook,
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as he showed that slide, I was like,
ooh, I get to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we started fruition seeds,
we were really thinking about where can we
[SPEAKER_03]: make the biggest impact?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just the two of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Petra had all of the seed knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been farming since the mid-'90s and
know a lot about food production and the
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution side and had worked some at
Cornell looking at small farm issues in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with my MBA background and some other
businesses I had run, had a good handle on
[SPEAKER_03]: how to explore opportunity and what types
of risks are we able to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we take an idea that we're
passionate about and bring it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_03]: So between us, we jumped in with this idea
that originally we were just going to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce all of our own seed, focus on the
finger lakes, and see what kind of needs
[SPEAKER_03]: assessment could be done for growers
within the finger lakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We quickly realized that doing that work
by ourselves wasn't the style that either
[SPEAKER_03]: of us really enjoyed pursuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both value a lot of our professional
and personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also seeing where the needs and
opportunities were, we realized that it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't just going to be us on our farm
doing that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit of feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that wonderful affliction where
when there's background noise my brain
[SPEAKER_03]: stops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we realized we wanted to start
working with other people and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to happen on our farm,
all of a sudden it expanded the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities of who we could work with,
not just at Cornell, but what farmers were
[SPEAKER_03]: in the region, what other ag
organizations, education organizations,
[SPEAKER_03]: what other seed companies and other
breeders are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the finger lakes, in New York,
in the Northeast, all of a sudden it
[SPEAKER_03]: became this really big network that we
instantly jumped into.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both really good at asking a lot of
questions and pursuing those ideas through
[SPEAKER_03]: others' expertise and experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking with Rachel right before
this conference, and she was talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: some mathematical selection theory that
she's been learning about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way we do our selection theory is
mostly through amazement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put stuff out there, we cross things,
we try things out, and then we find out
[SPEAKER_03]: what worked and what didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually works really well for a
small company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not work well depending on what
products you're and what crops you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us, we're very much about test,
you know, analyze the results,
[SPEAKER_03]: take the next leap, making really small
steps and taking small risks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most, I should have probably done a
slide show on the failures that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced in the last five years because
most of what we do doesn't work and every
[SPEAKER_03]: once in a while things do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a startup or as an entrepreneur,
it's thinking, it's continually to explore
[SPEAKER_03]: what pieces work for our company,
for our skill set, for our market,
[SPEAKER_03]: and trying to make lots of mistakes small
and quick, and then settle in on the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are working well that then we
can scale out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually, there was three things
that I wanted to make sure I covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the first was about our impact
and who can we really serve.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second is we think about our work more
as artists than we do entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're, although we need to make
profits, we need to make a living,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have employees that we have to hire and
retain, we're really thinking about how do
[SPEAKER_03]: we do our work well enough today to
capture and acquire enough customers so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can continue to do our work
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the drive is not how do we get to X
type of salary or X size of company or X
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way we think about it is we love doing
this work, we want to make sure we can
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every step, that's why we're really
okay with a lot of failures because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: our process of exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as we're finding some successes
along the way, we know we can continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that from season to season and day to
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third piece that I want to touch
on that I will, you know, keep weaving
[SPEAKER_03]: this in is there's a writer and thinker a
lot around marketing, Seth Godin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody has read any of
his books.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty amazing if you're going to
start your own company or even if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working within another company and you're
thinking about products and communication
[SPEAKER_03]: and the whole side of marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had this piece where he said the
opposite of more is not less.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really resonates with us as a
small company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's Petra and I, we have two
year-round employees and then we have
[SPEAKER_03]: seasonal hands anywhere from two to four
people now that come in in the spring,
[SPEAKER_03]: work through the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're always thinking about,
you know, how do you do, one way to think
[SPEAKER_03]: about it is how do you do more with less,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: With less resources, with less time,
with less money, with less experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But another way to think about it that
gives you a different set of answers is
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really helped us continue to
steer where we've gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we originally started,
we were doing lots of work ourselves as we
[SPEAKER_03]: started to build these connections with
Cornell and other market growers it was
[SPEAKER_03]: how do we identify the needs that we're
hearing from growers and what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing out of the university and other
extension staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we put us all in the same room,
on the same farm, in the same conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: and apply some of that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we focus some of our
better piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to run through what does better
look like for us at fruition seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have this process that we had to
give a name to after a couple of years of
[SPEAKER_03]: running around and doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it custom collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is focusing on, again, back to this
idea of impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really focused on the finger lakes,
people and growers that we can work with
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, have direct contact with
here to understand their needs and their
[SPEAKER_03]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with about a dozen market
growers in the finger lakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are a little bit farther out helping
them identify their genetic needs on their
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a San Marzano paste tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very common paste tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top, there's a grower in Lodi that
grows a really large significant crop of
[SPEAKER_03]: this for their late summer, early fall as
a processing tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hate the yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've noticed over the years as
they've tried strains from lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: different seed companies and different
seasons and different cultural practices,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's always a range of fruit size,
overall yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they asked if we could start working
with them on that selection work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see this is, you know,
how we started to phenotypically start to
[SPEAKER_03]: make some selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all from the same field,
but you're getting different plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: are throwing different size fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way it works, so here's just some
of our different farms and some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: different farmers we work with all the way
over from Norwich, which is east of here
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually a grower in the Hudson
Valley, to some Trumansburg and Lodi
[SPEAKER_03]: growers on Seneca Lake, and then some
growers over towards Rochester and closer
[SPEAKER_03]: to us on the western side of the finger
lakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we work on a whole bunch of different
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kales, radishes, beets, chard,
you know, you can see all of those
[SPEAKER_03]: different crops that we work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's an S, it means we're working on
multiple crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way it works, again, it's all very
farmer-led.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's them identifying what their needs are
on their farm, whether it's a seasonality
[SPEAKER_03]: issue, they're looking to extend their
season later into the fall with their
[SPEAKER_03]: greens program, whether it was that San
Marzano that I pointed out around yields
[SPEAKER_03]: and productivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're evaluating some of their chard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love red chard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a really significant market for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've found over the years two things,
well, three things really have been
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, again, as they explore what all
the seed stock out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found three things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, it's less red, so they're getting
lots of this variation in their red kale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, it's bolting earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And three, the architecture is becoming
less and less upright.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's becoming more prostrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe 60, 70 percent of their plants
are performing the way they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of a field production,
that's pretty low for what they really
[SPEAKER_03]: expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started working with them,
making selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: On, you know, on bolt resistance,
on dark red stems, on a rumpled green
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf, on good veining.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working with them now for,
this is our third generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going, you know, this is that
part of that selection through amazement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really had no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hadn't worked with Beta vulgaris and
hadn't worked with chard, so we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know how quickly our selections would
actually make a visible improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it, you know, even within that first
generation, we saw a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue that we're running into now is
at some point we have to take that
[SPEAKER_03]: selection work that we've been doing for
the farm, and they're getting the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's working out great, we have to be
able to take that seed and bring it into
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace so that we get,
so we can make some money so we can do the
[SPEAKER_03]: next project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where we're running into issues now is
just on seed quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the grower, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can give them several 5, 10 pounds of
seed, and if it's low germ and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing everything through transplants or
they can cold water shock to deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: some dormancy issues, they can deal with
low germ because they know the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to get are going to be
outperforming anything else they get.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can't sell that seed through our
seed company on the open market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what we're having to do is look
towards a west coast grower that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: send our stock to, they can produce it,
send it back to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second issue that we're going
to face that we've experienced with other
[SPEAKER_03]: crops is once we deal with the seed
quality issue is the marketing of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still going to be a ruby red chard.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ruby red chard in hundreds of seed
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's produced more or less as a commodity,
so it's very cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do we communicate that this
ruby red chard is something different if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for something different?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really where our challenge is
as a small company, how to communicate
[SPEAKER_03]: this really detailed, focused work really
that was for a specific farm but is
[SPEAKER_03]: important to other growers, but how do you
differentiate other than just in your,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have three, four lines in your catalog
on your website to say why your chard is
[SPEAKER_03]: different or better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it comes back to this idea of winning
one customer over at a time, convincing
[SPEAKER_03]: one more grower to try it, to experience
it, to give us feedback
[SPEAKER_03]: winning that customer over this year so we
can do the work again next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: winning over another customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are continually amazed at the work
that can happen in that relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll recognize Michael Mazurek doing his
fancy squash dance down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is another way that we've pursued
some of our breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Zade is a grower up in, or out in
Norwich.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really dependent on a squash called
Magda which was a hybrid that had been
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped from the seed company that was
carrying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Michael do some participatory
breeding together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael mentioned that Zade was frustrated
that he didn't have any Magda seed and was
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for a replacement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael gave us some technical expertise
and training on some, what we could do to
[SPEAKER_03]: either recreate it or create a better one,
a Cusa style squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Michael's been advising us in the
technical side of our breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now into the fifth generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and then this is another grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed an isolation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I didn't mention is we, Petra and I
operate three different farms in Naples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows about 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that allows us to manage our isolations
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at times as we work with other growers
on projects for their farm, they allow us
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nathaniel's a big greens grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he allows us to do some of our cucurbit
work at his farm in exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this kind of, in this loop,
Michael continues to provide us with,
[SPEAKER_03]: as we go through our breeding work,
making sure we're doing more than just the
[SPEAKER_03]: amazement selection theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Zade is continuing to look at every
generation on his farm while we're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's looking at plant architecture,
fruit size, color, and mostly taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zade is extremely particular about taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's looking for a very specific flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every generation is on his farm as well
as on our farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this feedback loop continues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think we're getting, making some good
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall see in a year or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, once this becomes, Zade,
there's enough, there's enough fruit every
[SPEAKER_03]: season that Zade is able to market and
sell the produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though he's not getting exactly what
he wanted, he's getting closer to what he
[SPEAKER_03]: wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, you know, which allows us for our
breeding program to keep some of the costs
[SPEAKER_03]: lower because he's using a lot of the
produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's able to market some of that,
which allows us to sell him some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed, even though it's early generation
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're recouping a little bit of money
in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once it's ready, then we can
publicly release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was another, we've been working on a
purple cone cabbage with another farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just, this was more kind of the
looseness and the kind of youngness of our
[SPEAKER_03]: company, how we do these relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them are just handshake
agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll work on this with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be providing us with plants or
kind of instead of us having a marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: department, they are our marketing
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're telling us what the need is and
where the gaps are within the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could just be on handshakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be on seed exchange where they
provide us with their cabbage plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We overwinter them, grow them to seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then give them the seed back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's an outright purchase with
some of the alliums we work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll purchase the seed from us that we
produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll grow out their fields of alliums.
[SPEAKER_03]: We come in and do all the selection work
for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We purchase at a wholesale price the
alliums we remove from their farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: from that population, produce the seed,
sell them the seed back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a monetary exchange back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with some of our more advanced
projects, where we have multiple projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: we kind of do a balance sheet approach
where the farmer talks about the expenses
[SPEAKER_03]: they're incurring in land and labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we lay out the expenses we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just figure out who owes who
at the end of the month or at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that's great about it is it
allows us to keep our farm focused on seed
[SPEAKER_03]: production and have these other farms
doing the population grow outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's a couple acres of kale
that we can go in and do selection work
[SPEAKER_03]: out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer is selling all of that kale.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a marketable crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we remove 10 plants or 300 plants,
it's no loss to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we didn't have to grow out these huge
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or with something like cabbage,
we don't have to grow cabbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just get to go into the farmer's field,
dig them up, overwinter them, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: produce seed the second year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get these really big populations
really at no cost for our program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the farmer isn't really giving up that
much, because it's only a very small
[SPEAKER_03]: selection of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some radishes we were working
on with another group.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other advantage that I touched on a
little bit is really this is our
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming directly from farms that know
what's available even more so than we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have their own trialing program.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always looking for the next crop,
the new crop, their replacement crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what market trends are
happening, whether they're a whole sale or
[SPEAKER_03]: a CSA grower or a market grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paying attention, because they're
the ones selling the produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know where their needs are and
what's not available to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more years we spend with them,
the more conversations we have,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more it influences the type of
projects and crops that we're excited and
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, we still have to be
able to sell seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we're paying for all of this
and making our living.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't just be a whim of a farmer to try
something out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really has to be something that's
clearly identified and an important
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity for us to pursue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the challenges really are just there's
lots of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Partially it's around communication,
making sure expectations are clear,
[SPEAKER_03]: outcomes are kind of laid out and
timelines and benchmarks, which we're
[SPEAKER_03]: learning how to deal with pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest thing that we're facing now is
just scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growers we work with want more seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are still primarily a seed packet
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sales side of our work is going to
home gardeners primarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our bulk seed is really only
available to this network of market
[SPEAKER_03]: growers that we support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if they're the ones producing
cabbage and we're doing a cabbage seed
[SPEAKER_03]: project with us, they still get to see our
bulk list and can buy off of that bulk
[SPEAKER_03]: list.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just the scale issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put 100 seeds in a packet versus 50
pounds of a brassica seed in a bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: your margins change as a small company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we're just trying to
understand how do we do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are starting to look at contract
growing outside of the Northeast and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about ourselves more.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we go through a lot of this,
as we've gone through this progression
[SPEAKER_03]: from this early, doing all this work
ourselves, improving a handful of
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties for the Finger Lakes in the
Northeast, as we've been influenced by
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, by breeders, I see Martha in the
back who's helped us with some stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're starting to think of ourselves more
as a merging into a small breeding company
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than a small seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do we make that next leap?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've started to do some hybrid seed
production work for ourselves as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: for other seed companies, which allows us
as a small company to do some niche
[SPEAKER_03]: specialty things where we can actually
make some margins on, because it hasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: blown up yet and being produced in other
regions that are maybe more economically
[SPEAKER_03]: productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also starting to look at where are
the, as we think about ourselves more in
[SPEAKER_03]: the breeding format, there's a lot of
stock seed work that we realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been selling a lot of our stock seed
as seed packet seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that over the last few years,
seed companies have come to us asking for,
[SPEAKER_03]: to purchase stock seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've said, oh, you can just buy that
off our rack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $2.99.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've realized we've missed an important
opportunity and also that there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: emerging need with seed companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may have all of their commercial
scale production lined up, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the stock seed isn't necessarily being
maintained and isn't necessarily being
[SPEAKER_03]: developed with regional focuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of those larger companies that are
looking for regionally focused stock seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's this new opportunity for us in
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's black.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where the breeding
program is going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I've kind of raced through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've covered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can talk about a whole bunch of
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's questions, I think we're
spot on for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, how do we decide who
we work with?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've generally narrowed it down to they
need to be experienced growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we want to make sure that they
understand their farm and their cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure that it's not just
them being an experienced grower and not
[SPEAKER_03]: managing the ability of weeds and water or
the alongside equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to make sure they're
experienced enough, that they're focused
[SPEAKER_03]: on whatever that crop is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that crop type, so that they have a
breadth of experience in looking at 30
[SPEAKER_03]: different carrots over the last 10 years
and understand that not every seed company
[SPEAKER_03]: has the same carrot, has the same
strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they're coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure they're coming in
with a body of knowledge about how to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce it well, what's available in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to be open to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning about their system, their market,
their methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because the thing we've learned several
times is that it's not the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the farmer, it's the market,
it's the processing crew of their farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of have to go around quite a
bit before we're willing to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, there seems to be a lot of debate in
USDA about organics and organic seed
[SPEAKER_06]: production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one side of the debate says that
regulations should be changed so that
[SPEAKER_06]: conventionally grown seed and GMO seed can
be used in organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a seed company, you have a big
threat ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if regulations change tomorrow,
and if growers are allowed to use
[SPEAKER_06]: conventional seed, or even GMO seed,
and produce their organic produce,
[SPEAKER_06]: what would happen to a company like yours?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, what is the threat to
USDA standards changing organic seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, I think our biggest challenge as I
talked about, maybe it was with Ruby and
[SPEAKER_03]: Char, it's still around communicating to
our customer base and our audience,
[SPEAKER_03]: regardless of what happens with the
organic standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have seed that is better suited and
outperforming based on the traits that we
[SPEAKER_03]: are confident in, the growers we're trying
to serve, I think that the regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: changes won't impact us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The harder challenge is how do we
communicate the work we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the pricing would be quite different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pricing would be different,
but I guess the piece behind that though
[SPEAKER_03]: is the value of the work we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody, and all of us have to meet
our bottom line, but not all of us will
[SPEAKER_03]: only shop by price.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are traits as well as values behind
those traits that people will continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to us to find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was a mid-size or large-scale
company, I would probably be more nervous
[SPEAKER_03]: about that type of regulation change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's other hurdles that we
focus on that are more significant for a
[SPEAKER_03]: mid-size or large-scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, NLP will never go GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, the biggest source of
organic seed right now is conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for organic because you have the
ability, as long as you use untreated
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, you can use conventional seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have, in the NLP international
organic standards, you have to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: three sources of seed and prove that you
cannot get organic seed of equal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the value, a farmer that goes
organic has to try to source organic seed
[SPEAKER_00]: first before he can go to take
conventional untreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a way, you're protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the NLP is actually pushing to make
that even harder and harder, meaning you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to source organic seed even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one really the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say in your favor, and I agree
totally, you've got the value.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that usually this time of year is
when we start to see that exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that situation happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our market growers and larger seed
orders happen in December and January.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start to get asked now for certain
varieties on larger volumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people all of a sudden are like,
why does everybody want Italian flat-leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: parsley all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_03]: We go look around, and we look at the big
three or four Northeast seed companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're all sold out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're still looking for an organic
source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just lower down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is semi-related and maybe a
touch of subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm interested in seed territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the organic seed community,
my point is, is relatively collaborative
[SPEAKER_04]: in its nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're still walking into a region
that has some heavy hitters in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetable seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just curious how fruition has
approached that and what kind of response
[SPEAKER_04]: the philosophy is on differentiating
yourself and the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to piss too many blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately, Petra is very gracious and
engaging and like her so we can make a few
[SPEAKER_03]: more mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sometimes a little cold-headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I think that's where we're
focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're focusing on depth, not breadth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our differentiation is really trying to
pay attention to the growers that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: have actual contact with and know that
that extends outside of the finger lakes
[SPEAKER_03]: to a broader region.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really having our hands on in the work
and trying to dig deeper and create better
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that maybe are already available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our new work is about bringing new
varieties that don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of our work is just increasing
the value of already important crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we've found is the organic
seed industry is really inviting,
[SPEAKER_03]: open, sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've visited all of the big and small
companies in the Northeast as well as some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're happy to show us most of their
secrets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of their secrets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them are mentors to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's nice now is like with this stock
seed piece that I brought up, some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those companies that we rely heavily on
for understanding of the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace, and some of the back-end
processes of running the seed company that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've mentored us in, they're now coming
to us and asking for us to produce stock
[SPEAKER_03]: seed for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some contract jobs, which feels really
nice that we're being seen as somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: that can contribute back to these other
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that it will continue to
just stay circular and reciprocate in all
[SPEAKER_03]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've definitely stepped up in most of
our support by just showing up and so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just a man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ordered a bunch of seeds from your
company.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the novelty of your
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, to be honest, I didn't
realize the whole process you go through
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up with some of these novel
varieties in your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you promote that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get your newsletter too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I learned a lot from your talk
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that creates an element of
novelty that is very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just say keep promoting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we process all of these
different crops?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were super fortunate and still are to
be close to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we first started, we'd run up to
Geneva all the time and have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: dirty seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bill would show us what screens,
air columns, gravity tables, you name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they gave us access to that,
which is really, really great for us to
[SPEAKER_03]: experience and explore what's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since then, we've just been modifying lots
of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of stuff on the old interweb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of small seed companies have to make
their own equipment or use
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory-scale equipment for processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's cucumbers in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where our scale issue has
started to come into place, where we used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to, an example is, so with some
of our winter squash now, we used to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do a single lot in a day's worth
of, we used a log splitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used vacuum cleaners.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run it through our simple water sluice
to separate the last of the pods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was fine for a single lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do one lot a day and work through
a bunch of different projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now some of our scale, it might,
at the way we're doing it, it might take
[SPEAKER_03]: us 10 days to do one single lot,
which all of a sudden can work,
[SPEAKER_03]: starts to become, you just can't hire
enough people, let alone you can't make
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at a few different
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is modifying some more equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other short, which we're
starting to work on, the other short-term
[SPEAKER_03]: is there's a seed company that has some
large-scale vine crop seed processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they said if we drive and drive the
trailer up there, we'll process it in two
[SPEAKER_03]: hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive it home with wet seed and drive it
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it still might be a day on the road and
hiring a driver, but it's not 10 days
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's incremental hurdles past the day,
as it takes us.
There's a question right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're working with a grower who's
interested in a new project, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: determine pricing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we determine pricing with a new
grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will take a shallot as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: We buy the shallot from the grower at a
wholesale price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have trouble figuring out how
much we sell the seed back to that grower
[SPEAKER_03]: for, because we just don't have enough
experience in volume production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I could make money if I sold it
back to them in packets, but when I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to send them back 100,000 seeds,
I just have to benchmark what other seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I add a premium to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for some of these earlier projects or
larger volume things, we don't have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: way to measure the production costs of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for us to put a genuine price on
it, where we know we're at least not
[SPEAKER_03]: losing money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just have to look around in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're hoping is that the process in
this exchange, where we buy the produce
[SPEAKER_03]: and sell the grower back the seed,
really we look at that as a reduction of
[SPEAKER_03]: our overhead in breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: That the sales part of what we're doing
will happen after the breeding project is
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll know what our costs are and
what we need to charge, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_03]: packing or in per thousand seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you structure the costs around the
breeding program?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for both the farmer and for us,
the idea is to contribute what we're best
[SPEAKER_03]: at and have the most of and try and bring
even in the breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have sort of a rule of thumb or
formula for how much of R&D costs do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to recoup from that grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: So do we have a formula for how much we
have to recoup?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's more about the
relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of hope at the end, our sales,
in our seed packet part of the business,
[SPEAKER_03]: allow us to keep doing that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about, we see the value of the
relationship as the first element in
[SPEAKER_03]: funneling and building our breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have a monetary formula.
[SPEAKER_03]: If everybody's happy and we want to do the
project into the next year and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing results, if we have to incur some
costs, which we do, then we're okay with
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be one more question.
Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
