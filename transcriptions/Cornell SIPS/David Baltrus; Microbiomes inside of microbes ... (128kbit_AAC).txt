[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first want to and I did this
yesterday, but I'll do this today again
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much the students like I've
been on both sides of Now I've been on
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides of both inviting people as grad
students as a committee and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome to be invited by people you know,
it's a We do this job and we toil away
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes and then it's nice to know that
at some level like people people recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: you so that's awesome Yeah, so the talk
I'll give today is completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the talk I gave yesterday What I like
to do in my lab is focus on a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a naturally curious person And I
like bacteria and so luckily bacteria do
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much everything in the world And so
there's a ton of topics to dive into the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic I'll talk about today was something
that I really started probably my third or
[SPEAKER_00]: second or third year Having a lab and it
really just blossomed from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some really good people at
Arizona that contribute greatly in Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: drive this project in a lot of ways too
that I'll I'll acknowledge now So Betsy
[SPEAKER_00]: Arnold is is an awesome collaborator
Rachel gallery is an awesome collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're fully involved in this as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I can't take any Personal credit it's
it's we work really well together as a
[SPEAKER_00]: team So I just want to say that upfront
mental I'll acknowledge Rachel and Betsy
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end as well Alright, so my talk
today is going to be on a symbiosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a symbiosis interaction at least
that I had no clue existed until I really
[SPEAKER_00]: started my lab so I was very focused on
Pseudomonas syringae and then started
[SPEAKER_00]: reading papers and Once you start reading
more broadly and you have some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: read more broadly you it opens your eyes
into a variety of different ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions can happen To begin though
and as a just to warm the room here do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit I'm going to talk about a
horrible human pathogen outbreak that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in about 1976 So in 1976 there
was a convention of American Legion folk
[SPEAKER_00]: in Philadelphia and so this convention
that takes place and I was during the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer I think of the Spanish flu or one
of the flus that came through and so
[SPEAKER_00]: People went to the convention a lot of
people got sick and then some people died
[SPEAKER_00]: from this convention There was a mystery
as to what the actual cause of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity was where this where this
infection came from Turns out that after a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of epidemiology and some
microbiology and some really cool genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: work The conventioners that the American
Legion folk were actually infected by a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of Legionella, which is now called
Legionella it was called something
[SPEAKER_00]: different back then it's Legionella
because American Legion convention
[SPEAKER_00]: Legionella has a pretty interesting life
cycle where it'll just kind of grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: human environments because there's amoeba
in human environments and so the amoeba
[SPEAKER_00]: really like the water the Legionella can
get into amoeba kind of survives
[SPEAKER_00]: intracellularly in amoeba and Always well
and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is involving human pathogenicity
there and everything is kind of hunky-dory
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem is that amoeba look a lot like
some human immune cells and so because
[SPEAKER_00]: Legionella has evolved to Infect amoeba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really good at infecting human
immune cells certain types of human immune
[SPEAKER_00]: cells like matric macrophage and so what
we think happened is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different bacteria can evolve to live
inside of a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryotic microorganisms like amoeba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we get the secondary Spill over
into things like human pathogenicity
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially things like plant
pathogenicity So just setting the stage
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of precedent for some work
in some systems Showing that bacteria can
[SPEAKER_00]: really proliferate and survive well in a
variety of different eukaryotic microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: the Legionella system in the amoeba system
is actually Amoeba are basically used as
[SPEAKER_00]: an analog of macrophage now a lot of
different labs and the genetics actually
[SPEAKER_00]: works out pretty well So there's paper
showing You know amoeba survival Dicty,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dictyostelium ends up being a good model
system for this as well and as Some labs
[SPEAKER_00]: here have shown as well and contributed
greatly to this is not limited just to
[SPEAKER_00]: just protists or Other single celled
eukaryotes seems like this is a more
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread phenomenon where there's a lot
of microscopic Eukaryotes that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: infected by or at least hosts different
types of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Really started this project because so I
started in about 2012 2013 when the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome wave was happening and
everybody's microbiome was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced and The joke used to be that
when I made this slide there was the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that didn't have a microbiome was an
otter now There's an otter microbiome even
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's microbiomes for everything and
there's a variety of systems where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown that I'm at least at the level
of plus or minus bacteria This seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect development physiology across a
variety of different eukaryotes What I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to focus on though is that there's
been a good legacy of at some level at
[SPEAKER_00]: some very specific level investigating
interactions between bacteria and fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and so, you know I when I started my lab
and when I was starting reading papers I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have a good appreciation that fungi
actually hosted a microbiome But once I
[SPEAKER_00]: started digging in it, it kind of makes
sense like lichens are well-known lichens
[SPEAKER_00]: are effectively a fungal microbiome
there's a burkholderia rhizocinica system
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a Candidates glomerulobacter and
I'm not the greatest fan of bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature But basically there's a
another candidate that can be in a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of micro mycorrhizal fungi There's other
systems where these other very specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems bacteria have evolved to
intimately interact with their fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts They seem to be vertically
inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be there's some certain
genomic properties there that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to this symbiosis And so
there's this legacy of at least at very
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized levels understanding that
Bacteria can interact with fungi can be
[SPEAKER_00]: intra hyphal inside of fungi and can
manipulate fungal Behavior and physiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again when I started I Didn't have
this appreciation and I think hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: I've contributed to expanding this This
theme throughout a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: systems So this work really started the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about today really started about
2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I emailed Betsy Arnold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a paper It might have been Teresa's
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been a different paper using
the same system Where I read a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that type 3 secretion was involved
in this burkholderia rhizocinica System
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I was coming from Jeff Dangle's lab
working on type 3 secretion in Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: syringi So hey type 3 secretion in
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can jump into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can figure out some stuff With the
factors and then type 3 secretion in
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I emailed Betsy Arnold and said hey Is
there any way we can team up and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: work on this and she said oh I got a
system for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people working on the
burkholderia Let's work on this other
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different system that that we
have no clue what they make of it But I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like all right like fair game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for it So all of this work just
started with an email and it kind of went
[SPEAKER_00]: from there So we'll talk about today
builds off of Betsy Arnold's work and
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy Arnold's a variety of people in
Betsy's lab where they identified in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different bacteria that can
actually interact pretty intimately in an
[SPEAKER_00]: endo-hyphal way with a variety of fungal
endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about today I'll just give
you an overview of this system and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you a little bit about the background
and the diversity of this then I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about my role and how my questions
interact with this system and so here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the overview
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so with the overview I'm a native
New Yorker, so I'm not used to
[SPEAKER_00]: microphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of scream at people but
Alright so with the overview I'll talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about bacterial simulants of
fungi and kind of Betsy's story working
[SPEAKER_00]: into this and then I'll start to get to
the nitty-gritty of it so if we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's bacteria inside of hyphae we can
ask questions like Do they alter fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way that we can control this
symbiosis and maybe engineer it in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the bacteria get out of this
partnership?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a type 3 secretion system?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all of these questions about
interactions that really I've come to you
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant pathology side But I'm
really just curious about how these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions evolve What kinds of genetic
structures these interactions and how
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward and how we can predict them
manipulate these interactions maybe for
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefit of Agriculture or you know
we're never going to feed nine million
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but we can we can feed at least a
couple more I think so an overview
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial simulants of fungi I'm not going
to show many pictures of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Have a hard time growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a I don't have a green thumb I'm
in a plant sciences department,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't grow plants very well So what
I can do is I can isolate bacteria from a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different plants and so a lot
of what I'll talk about today takes place
[SPEAKER_00]: in the comp You have to imagine put your
thinking caps on imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all taking place in the context of
Plants like this so this platycladius
[SPEAKER_00]: orientalis basically a juniper Juniper
berry kind of plant the needles on it are
[SPEAKER_00]: like pine needles They're kind of
coniferous and tough all of the fungi that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about For the most part of today
were isolated from this type of plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the bacteria I'll talk about from this
fungi are theoretically living either on
[SPEAKER_00]: the needles or inside of the fungi inside
of the Russian dollotus whole system If
[SPEAKER_00]: you look across different plant species,
I don't know if there's an exception to
[SPEAKER_00]: this I'm pretty sure there's not but if
you sample all plant species will contain
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes at some level a lot of them
have fungal endophytes and these fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes Contribute to different plant
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have been shown to influence
pan plant physiology and immune systems
[SPEAKER_00]: They make them a little bit more resistant
to pathogens some of them are potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, you know that every plant
species seems to have its own fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: Endophytes at some level these juniper
species and Betsy has shown us throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of plants throughout the world
these tend to be covered in fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes, so if you just sample a little
bit of a The pine needle you'll find a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity in terms of the fungi that
actually live there or live in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: or live in the stems or live in the soil
around the fungi or the around the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungi I'll focus on for about three
quarters of the talk today are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes of leeks and so they're found
within Leaves and that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy specialized on going around the
world Fungal endophytes of leaves have a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an interesting life cycle when you
think about it And so a lot of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: found so when the leaf emergence it tends
to be sterile in a lot of plants the fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: we think Through spores and other ways get
up and infect the leaves as they emerge
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a really high level of
diversity within a leaf over a short
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time So, you know within a
couple weeks you get a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse types of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually within these leaves
Eventually though, you know spoiler alert
[SPEAKER_00]: everything dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually the leaf is going to die
It's going to fall to the ground and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these fungi end up being able to switch
their life cycle to become saprotrophic So
[SPEAKER_00]: they go from endophytes to saprotrophs and
we don't really understand that transition
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of a cool transition if the
same fungi are doing both roles So
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually the saprotrophs break down
things in the soil they spoil later or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Some other mysterious ways they might
get up into the air again, but those
[SPEAKER_00]: spores get up in the air, which we think
Then infect those newly emerging leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is kind of a Lion King circle
of life thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four-year-old so I speak in
Disney movies a lot of the time so I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize for that up front, but If you
guys have kids you understand that very
[SPEAKER_00]: well frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've taken all the frozen references
out but All right, so What Betsy showed
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is where this is where I come
into the story So I came in right after
[SPEAKER_00]: this paper was published Betsy and her
former grad student slash postdoc Michelle
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoffman had shown In a variety of these
fungal endophytes that they seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: contain bacterial symbionts and though
it's a cool story to understand I This is
[SPEAKER_00]: the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell I think Betsy tells it slightly
different, but I like my version better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Betsy is very very detailed and very
specific in how she Carries things and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleans things and her and Michelle were
isolating a bunch of these fungi from
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world We're preparing sterile
isolates of it and then putting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: water auger or water or water vouchers and
so over time They just had this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of water vouchers of fungi
which is basically just fungi in water
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, they would see
bacterial contaminants pop up in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: auger and they're like, oh, there's you
know, we got to autoclave things better
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got to clean things better and it'd
be really really vehement and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: these bacteria out because they thought
they were contaminants when they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: look back at the data the same
contaminants are popping up in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal cultures and No matter how well
they cleaned they would get these same
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants coming up again and again and
again Then Betsy and Michelle Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they're not contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're actually in the fungi and
they're just popping out at certain levels
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they did some fish
these are fish papers from 16s fish from a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different fungi basically these
dots are Bacteria that seemed to be within
[SPEAKER_00]: the hyphae of a variety of different fungi
So again, this is where I come in What
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy Michelle were able to do was just
you know 16s PCR and amplify using
[SPEAKER_00]: amplicon sequencing a variety of these
bacterial sequences from the fungi they
[SPEAKER_00]: built a tree the tree is going to happen
in a second in a couple slides,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I Will get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think and this is kind of how
Betsy's whole isolation scheme So we think
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens is that there's just fungi
and bacteria inside of those fungi inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaves of things like platyclitis We
can plate out the fungi and then They look
[SPEAKER_00]: like normal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just plate them out on just normal
auger Bacteria don't emerge out at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this plus represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bacteria inside of there But
when you actually grow them on plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see the bacteria popping out It
took a while to figure this out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not just that you can put the
fungi and have the bacteria pop out What
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do is stress out the fungi and
bacteria a little bit And so what we would
[SPEAKER_00]: do and again, this is sometimes you do
indirect experiments that end up showing
[SPEAKER_00]: you how to the way So it turns out you
need to heat shock These fungi a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and then you get the bacteria kind of
dotting out and growing out from the fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can take these Clean fungal isolates
heat shock them a little bit and then We
[SPEAKER_00]: get what we now call EHP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of emerging out Now I think
there's the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so Betsy and Michelle sequenced
both without culturing and then with
[SPEAKER_00]: culturing some of them Variety of these
different bacterial types that they found
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of these fungal endophytes This is
a tree representing a lot of the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: they found I like this tree because it
represents a couple of things that I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to frame this question with First off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tree that shows a huge diversity
of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have gram positives a
proteobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of proteobacteria there And
then even within the proteobacteria some
[SPEAKER_00]: other more specialized ones One I want to
make is there's gram positives and gram
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives in this tree It's not like
there's a truly specialized, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern that we're seeing yet Second thing
I want to point out with this in this
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow box that represents the
Burkholderia If you look at a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different bacteria interacting with fungal
systems More often than not, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a Burkholderia that you see And so this
yellow box represents the Burkholderia in
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of different forms Even that
candidatus glomerobacter Again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get in arguments with nomenclature
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glomerobacter kind of is the
Burkholderia clade like it's just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more specialized Nonetheless,
glomerobacter is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burkholderia is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another Burkholderia endophorum on
the different clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that yellow box effectively represents
the 80% of what was known before Betsy
[SPEAKER_00]: published this paper showing kind of
bacterial diversity inside of fungi What
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy was able to show him, what Betsy and
Michelle showed are in this blue box.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all isolates from different
fungal sequencing isolates from different
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we have some Burkholderia I
didn't put overlay on that but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other types of bacteria they were
never really shown to be associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi before and there's a huge diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gram positives, a bunch of alpha
proteobacteria, a bunch of gamma,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta, all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice part about these is that a lot of
these bacteria end up being highly
[SPEAKER_00]: cultureable, very easily cultureable and
so as a bacteriologist, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: screamed out to me like I can actually do
genetics and grow these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like an awesome system to
actually jump into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different diversity within
bacteria, within fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we actually started looking at the
phylogenetic diversity and matching up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which bacteria was found in
which fungal hosts, what you would see was
[SPEAKER_00]: that within, and these boxes just
represent clades of bacteria, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue box and within the red box,
these are different isolates of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: from fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the fungal names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to take away from this is
that we find very similar bacteria in very
[SPEAKER_00]: different fungal hosts, all within kind of
the Ascomycetes but very different fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've even now got nearly identical
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically there's no snips between the
strain, no single nucleotide polymorphisms
[SPEAKER_00]: between the bacterial strains found within
different classes of Ascomycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that speaks that there's
maybe, these are being horizontally
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred across strains pretty
frequently and pretty readily versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical inheritance that you may see with
things like the burgledaria or the
[SPEAKER_00]: glomeribacter or the molecules isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this in a variety of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's, these are the ones,
the blue box is the ones I'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Ludibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of xanthomonas, Diela,
Ludibacter things, yellow, proteobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are more enteric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get Irwinia, Pantoia, other things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we find Irwinia, very similar
Irwinia strains across very different
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think they're being horizontally
transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even within the same fungal
hosts, we can find multiple isolates that
[SPEAKER_00]: are divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have a fungal host,
Pestilodeopsis, that actually has,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in this case, we have one that's a
Pestilodeopsis that has Ludibacter and a
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's, I'm showing a Pestilodeopsis
within Irwinia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a Ludibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be multiple bacterial types
within the same fungal hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spatially, we don't have it quite worked
out yet, but it seems like we've found
[SPEAKER_00]: about up to, I think, 12 different 16S
sequences within a high full map of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like there's potential there
for quite a high amount of diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to what we would originally
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't quite know how they're
spatially structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like there is some spatial
structure to where they're found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can find multiple bacterial
isolates within the same fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's interesting going
forward, kind of thinking about what that
[SPEAKER_00]: does in terms of combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far majority of them, though, just have
kind of one isolate that we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 12 in some cases, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are culture-able.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're culture-able, that means we
can do a lot of interesting bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and other associations between
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also clear the fungi of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was pretty easy to kind of
figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other labs have shown this
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we grow these fungi, on a cocktail
of antibiotics, and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: this doesn't even work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we grow them on a cocktail of
antibiotics, eventually we can get clean
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi without bacterial symbionts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We verify this through fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We verify it through PCR and just through
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get Azenic isolates, Azenic just
meaning no bacteria, colonizing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can culture the bacteria and we can
culture the fungal hosts, it seems like we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to try to figure out how to
put them back together as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a while, probably two years,
to figure out the tricks with this because
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't take for a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we finally figured out that if we grow
the fungus and bacteria separately,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix them together in mineral media in some
cases, the trick was actually growing them
[SPEAKER_00]: in mineral media and giving them a little
bit of a starvation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the bacteria tend to go back
into the fungi a lot more under those
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it ends up being pretty easy to
re-associate these if you have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mix them together in liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tend to just go back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can re-associate bacteria with
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we prove this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we prove it through, again,
through PCR, through just culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow, if you take this mixed
culture and just put it on a plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see any bacteria growing on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think they're inside, but then you
can do things like microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to show you in this case
is we've been able to label with TD tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: a fluorophore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've labeled the Ludibacter with that
fluorophore.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we just did some microscopy
showing fluorescence of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is going to be look here for the
re-inoculated bacterial isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just going to be a sterile hyphae
showing that there's no background
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's TD tomato showing up kind of
along the lines of the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reviewers tolerated this, but they
weren't quite happy with this because,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can kind of, they look like
they're inside the hyphae, but they might
[SPEAKER_00]: just all be attached to the hyphae and
kind of fluorescent, even if you did it
[SPEAKER_00]: from planes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it published, but we weren't quite
happy with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took us a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we had that fluorescent isolate
of bacteria, I mean, then we could do
[SPEAKER_00]: confocal microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using my own computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a fancy illustration of showing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be as dramatic as I
want it to be, but here's the confocal
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do Z-stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you label the TD tomato, there's a
bacteria in the little red spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue on the outside is chalcophore,
so that basically stains chitin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stains the fungal walls blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do a Z-stack through this,
you can basically definitely tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's fluorescent bacteria inside of the
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just that they're bound to
the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I just imagine a little bit,
this part turns blue, and then the red
[SPEAKER_00]: goes away, and then the blue comes back on
the other side of the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, kind of sad when you spend a lot
of time trying to get this, and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if any of y'all are reviewing that
paper, we finally have the confocal
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly, at least in this case,
truly believe that we can re-inoculate and
[SPEAKER_00]: then get back inside the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'll see, we don't think that they're
super dense inside the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in a lot of cases, we think they
might go into some stasis, kind of a not
[SPEAKER_00]: really growing actively state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're at least growing actively
enough to make that TD tomato a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorophore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I want to show you,
and this is another trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of this talk ends up being a
lot of the tricks I learned along the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to figure out how to actually do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I wanted to do was try
to measure, can we figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-associate these bacteria where I could
almost not in a high throughput way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a much more systematic way go
through and understand host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is in evolutionary
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand the genetics and how
host range evolves across a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why I went to Pseudomonas
syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like to go to now with this
fungal system, I want to understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does host range evolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there host range?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's still a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a host range?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what is the genetics underlying
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get to that point, I need to set up
a pretty straightforward host range
[SPEAKER_00]: re-association system.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background was in helicobacter in grad
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a trick to actually select
intracellular just using tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and human tissue culture cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you could do with helicobacter is if
you took tissue culture cells mixed in
[SPEAKER_00]: helicobacter, put in genomycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomycin ends up being, if you target it
right, get the right concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: genomycin ends up killing extracellular
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inside the cell is protected because
the genomycin doesn't penetrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a shot in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I magically picked the right levels to go
with in the beginning with the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm showing you here is the
initial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a liquid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just bacteria inoculated into
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let this grow for three days,
again, in minimal media, so M9.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two populations that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's multiple replicates within
these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiple replicates here, multiple
replicates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I can do on day four is just
hit them with genomycin at 40 nanograms
[SPEAKER_00]: per microliter, put that in, and then
measure the cultural bacteria that come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the supernatant, not measuring the
fungi, that come out of the supernatant
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you'll see that in the no
genomycin treatment, they don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just kind of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genomycin treatment, universally,
I get nothing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either they're being killed
extracellularly, extra hyphally,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're just being non-culturable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, I think it's a pretty
good selective measure where if I do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can at least screw up the outer side of
the bacteria outside the fungi at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level, where I think it acts as a
sieve to select at some level for ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that get back inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of happy to see that that
actually worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going forward, now I have an assay to
measure, can we take different bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates, put them back into a single
fungal isolate, and see, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: primary question here, is there something
as a host rage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just every bacteria that is
available gets in, or is there some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of way that fungi can select for who gets
back in, or some way that bacteria can
[SPEAKER_00]: actively evolve to get back in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I'm going to do this assay is
going to grow up, just like I showed you
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last case, grow up the bacteria and
fungi together in mineral media,
[SPEAKER_00]: add genomycin for a day, which
theoretically either kills or renders
[SPEAKER_00]: non-culturable everything in the
supernatant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll take that fungal mass,
which is growing in the liquid culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: plate it out on water auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, really no nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these bacteria grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to grow on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the fungal mass expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after five, six, seven,
eight days, I'll pick on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: growing edge of the fungal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in no case do I see bacteria
actually growing on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those confocal images and the
microscopy images I've shown before is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place in this plate context,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done the controls to show it's
not that the bacteria are just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferating on the auger plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're actually in the hyphae
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to sample on the edge of
the growing hyphae, just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a bunch of different samples per
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one I was just showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sample was taking four days,
five days, six days, and seven days after
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there's not bacteria kind of
proliferating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly just fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data I'll show on the next slide is
just taking these cores, plating them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done this in a bunch of different
replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of saddened at the beginning,
because we worked with probably eight
[SPEAKER_00]: different endohyphal bacteria that I was
like, oh, there's got to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation here in a single fungal
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's got to be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did this assay, they all seem to go
into the same levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a lot of bacteria back out of
these single fungal cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of those endohyphal bacteria seem
to go in at the same levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe there's not a host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got my little variety of other
side projects in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to work with Pseudomonas stutzeri,
which is just a ubiquitous environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's naturally transformable, so the
genetics is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my baby, my lab baby that I try
to work in any experiment that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a Ludiebecker strain,
reassociated with a fungal host,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then took a bacterial, that
Pseudomonas stutzeri strain, did the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to have to wait for the
reveal on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've reached the level of
associate professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen every technological
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so what you're seeing here is
just a bunch of those fungal hyphal cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is log CFU, so this is a log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a Ludiebecker species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we get 10 to the 5th out per
centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of Ludiebecker there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas stutzeri, usually we get back
nothing, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there really is something as a
host range in terms of some bacteria can
[SPEAKER_00]: reassociate and some can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, I'll get a little
bit of Pseudomonas stutzeri coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: these assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some that get into the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I don't show the cleaned up
data is because there's a number there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a positive number.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every case where I followed up on this,
there's Ludiebecker contamination in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hyphae as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of cross-get it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's just stutzeri, it doesn't get
back in at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix it a little bit with
Ludiebecker, the stutzeri can get back in
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's something cool going on
there that I haven't fleshed out yet as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are qualitative differences and
reassociation capabilities, which at some
[SPEAKER_00]: level means there's something like host
range within these bacteria and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, again, going forward is kind of
awesome for the way I like to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and the way I like to test the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the symbiont of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we can do reassociations and kind
of do the controlled assays, we can ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about, do these bacteria
actually contribute to fungal behavior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they change anything at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take this pestilodeopsis 9143
isolate, naturally infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ludiebecker species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate bacterial nomenclature,
but indigo, because they have to do field
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to actually name this guy,
because they have to do that for the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: and release and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to now be called
Ludiebecker, I think, mycovisinus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mycovisinus for fungal proximity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ludiebecker 9143 is the isolate that
comes from 9143.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fungi is naturally infected with that
yellow Ludiebecker bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can cure that fungi, that fungus,
by antibiotic treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can re-synthesize this strain
with the same bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the data I'll show you going
forward will be called natural infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: cured, or re-synthesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of keep those in your head
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of different assays I
could show, but I like this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it kind of makes an interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these fungal endophytes end up
having, again, that circle of lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can be plant growth promoting,
they can be degraders, saprotrophs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, for a variety of reasons,
we went down the road of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation, because maybe JGI likes that
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in quantifying the
ability of fungi to degrade various plant
[SPEAKER_00]: materials with and without bacterial
symbionts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assay I'll show you here is just a
cellulase assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Congo Red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds to things like cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in the plant, it binds to a
bunch of different sugars, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've kind of ruled those out as a
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fungal mass growing in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're just going to measure this
zoning, this clearing outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cellulase, whatever it is,
we see clearing outside of the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: mass's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to measure in
terms of our quantitative ability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally infected has a certain amount of
clearing, which we kind of normally
[SPEAKER_00]: normalize to a level around one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So naturally infected has a certain amount
of clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cured strain of this 9143,
we see no clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a nice qualitative
something's changing in these fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the bacteria away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clearing zone goes away, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because we can re-synthesize,
we can actually do the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the bacteria back in with the
re-synthesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clearing comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever it is, whatever this
bacteria is doing, it's affecting whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: this clearing zone means in terms of
cellulose clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our foray into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you take a shot in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a quantitative assay on a
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just mix plants and fungi
together and see what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still amazed that this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to say is that the
bacteria themselves, the luteobacter,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a little bit of cellulase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in transposymmutants,
we still see that clearing zone going
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the bacteria that's doing it
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something happening to the fungus
that's leading to that clearing activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about rates of decomposition?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm amazed that this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can do is take plant material,
put it in a petri dish, and then inoculate
[SPEAKER_00]: it either with fungus, azenic fungus,
or fungus with that 9143 strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we let that go for three months,
what you can actually do is weigh this
[SPEAKER_00]: petri dish over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, you do it in replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you weigh that over time, you can
actually measure mass loss because we
[SPEAKER_00]: parafilm them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they lose, either through water or CO2
or something, they lose mass from this
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually measure amounts of
degradation over time just by weighing the
[SPEAKER_00]: petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very non-intuitive graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the higher the number here,
the greater the mass loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most intuitive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But greater the number, the more mass is
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of mass is being lost here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we've done this in a bunch of
different replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stats worked out, as I'll show
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a high end, we've got 3% and then 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the naturally-infected, just that
naturally-infected fungus, we get about a
[SPEAKER_00]: 2% mass loss over, again, two or three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cured fungus, we get less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's maybe 75% of the mass loss or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, non-parametric stats, like a bunch
of replicates like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever, it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can do that resynthesis and
show, does this come back together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, it comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually recapitulate that mass
loss with the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's not the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sometimes people don't like numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the picture I'm going to show you
next hopefully convinces you that
[SPEAKER_00]: something else is happening here,
because I'm going to show you pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: those various treatments, at least
representative pictures from those
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the control with nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the mass loss of no fungus
growing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a different fungus, but the same
kind of a treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is azenic fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, after three months, hasn't broken
down that plant material at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fungus plus bacteria, you get a nice
map that's actually breaking down stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens really repeatably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have numbers, but that's pretty
striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get growth and not growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it's like a 1% difference,
you're measuring degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something's cool happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the data following up on
this, but we basically just finished the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step with this was to take
plus and minus bacteria fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a litter box or a litter bag,
and stick it in the ground for three
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kinds of trends happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the degradation difference happens in
the ground in Arizona in January,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is weird because it's not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed that it works, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the same difference in degradation
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this might be ecologically
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious going forward in the
future with the genetics of all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think there's a lot of questions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the fungal behavior side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy has some other stories showing that
plant oxygen production, plant hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: production synthesis by the fungus kind of
changes with the bacteria, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a story here going forward
where that partnership actually matters
[SPEAKER_00]: for a variety of different fungal traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can ask, what do the bacteria get
out of this partnership?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: At some level, it might be things like
antibiotic resistance, where if they hide
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the hyphae, I've already showed you
that they can tolerate genomycin at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there might be something else there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with this question, I'm going to
focus on that Ludibacter mycovisinus
[SPEAKER_00]: species that I'm focused on before,
because I noticed something weird with
[SPEAKER_00]: that species compared to a bunch of the
other bacteria I was working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you actually look through,
we had a bunch of these Ludibactors pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a variety of different fungi,
and it just seemed like there was
[SPEAKER_00]: something there that was different with
the Ludibactors versus the other bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at biosphere, just
microbiome samples, you don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ludibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them a lot in the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought maybe this is something to
dig in and actually make the system out
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the story behind this is that I
had my Ludibacter, and I teach microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics course every year, and we do a
transposing immunogenic experiment with
[SPEAKER_00]: the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just assumed that things would behave,
and so I knew Ludibacter grew on LB media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, we can grow it on LB,
make transposing on mutants, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: can look for things like oxytroph mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set up this whole lab with 80
undergraduates, and they were looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: oxytrophic mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out Ludibacter doesn't grow
in N9 media alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of naturally an oxytroph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you set up labs for 80 people,
test that it works first before jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that led me to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that Ludibacter, from that lab,
I knew it didn't grow in mineral media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that if we put Ludibacter in
with the fungus in liquid mineral media,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would get bacteria in the supernatant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see the bacteria growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of recapitulated that
experiment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a growth curve in liquid
culture in N9 mineral media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Ludibacter without fungus in the
triangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of stays static.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow it with the fungus, put the
fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ludibacter in the supernatant,
the density goes up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fungus is able to produce
something that feeds the Ludibacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something it's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we would interpret this as
maybe there is an oxytropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's some pathway in the fungus,
in the bacteria that's missing an amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid production pathway or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the typical assumption you
would make based off of this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I went back in,
tested every amino acid individually with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ludibacter to see if it could
complement growing within that liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that it was not a simple
story, but it's a cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was two amino acids that could
complement Ludibacter growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In liquid culture, in N9, cysteine and
methionine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are those having come?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only sulfur-containing amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that if you add
sulfur-containing amino acids to N9,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ludibacter can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started digging around in the genome,
trying to figure out what's actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Ludibacter, it's like a
xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a proteobacter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be able to grow on sulfate
because all the mineral medias are derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and they all have magnesium sulfate
in them as a sulfur source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on with Ludibacter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just from a different paper
showing, again, across proteobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all transport sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all really good at acquiring
sulfur from sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at Ludibacter, it's actually
missing all the sulfate transporters and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the associated genes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's weird for proteobacteria because
it can't use sulfate as a sulfur source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's using in terms of
growth with the fungus, but I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: might be hand-wavingly potentially a step
towards more of a specialization going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future with the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a cool early stages
maybe of a more specialization that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing because it's just weird that they
don't use sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say in a couple of marine
systems, you do see a eukaryotic microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying sulfur through DMSP to some of
its microbes that actually grow on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's precedent with sulfur transport
between eukaryotes and microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing I'm going to talk about is how
do we use this data going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do going forward in terms of
potentially manipulating microbiomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe making the world a little bit of a
better place?
[SPEAKER_00]: We always like to write that in grants,
but I'm cynical, but we'll see going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we actually make a difference and
engineer some microbiomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about plant microbiomes is that
they're really hard to change once they
[SPEAKER_00]: get established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria coming from the outside
environment, they're coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil, the air, the vectors,
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once the plant is there,
it's really hard to change the microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start thinking about this,
there's a couple of places where I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really manipulate who's growing on
the plants and how you can change the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology of the plants going forward
with the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drew a tree, and I always like to show
the tree that I drew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do the small victories in
science sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to focus on though is
the microbiome is hard to change once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: established, but at the beginning,
maybe we can change it a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of skew it towards manipulating
physiology of plant hosts in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be beneficial going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can do this at the stage of
the seed, because the seed typically is
[SPEAKER_00]: colonized by a few, if any, fungi and
bacteria, and we might be able to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference if we actually do things like
coat seeds, and that might affect
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rates or survival of seeds in
different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a grad student who wrote an EPA
fellowship to go down to, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama, which was awesome, because he's
like, I'm going to Panama to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had a fun time down there,
but what he was doing was investigating
[SPEAKER_00]: seed-borne fungi and their bacterial
symbionts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we manipulate the bacterial
symbionts of these seed-borne fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate germination rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant that I'm going to show you data
from was Sacropia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ends up being one of these pioneer
species in the Panamanian rainforest or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever tropics, one of those hot places
that's not for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sacropia is one of these pioneer trees
where it's really limited by sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the rainforest, you get holes when
trees fall down, and then these pioneer
[SPEAKER_00]: trees pop up really quickly, and it's kind
of a life strategy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sacropia is one of those trees that
really pops up to capitalize in those open
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds end up being huge, and they end
up being pretty easy to collect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's why Justin actually went
with these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assay he did was basically to,
just like before, isolate fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the fungi and antibiotics,
and try to cure them of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had a bunch of different pair
of isolates of bacteria and no bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi isolated from Sacropia seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assay he then did was in like 50 days
in a shade house in Panama, he would take
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these, great grad students now,
great postdoc doing CRISPR stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Justin Schaeffer's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have a chance to hire him in
the future, hire him, he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my plug for Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I have no clue whether he
applies anywhere, but nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Justin would do is he would take
these individual seeds, put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dish, cover the dish for like 50 days,
and then go back and measure the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here some of these seeds
germinate, some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you measure the percentage of
germination of these plates, both with
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria in fungi and just with fungi
alone without bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these plates have fungi on them,
and the fungi have bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's very different fungi,
very different strategies here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just going to measure germination
rates in Sacropia seeds going through
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the best genetically controlled
experiment, but you do what you can in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That at Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he found was in a variety of
different cases with different fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know kind of who the players are in
all of this, you can get different results
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on which partnership you
actually choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, and in a majority of
cases, we actually saw fungi with bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: had more germination of the seeds than
just fungi alone with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing minus and plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus is without bacteria, plus is with
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just, again, a completely
non-intuitive graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is low germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is higher germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low germination, higher germination,
low, higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria plus the fungi seem to affect
the germination rate of those seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: that shade house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other cases, we get no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a good control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in some cases, we actually get a
negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether you want to call this a
pathogen or not, you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: semantics of how to call this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, we've got a fungus alone
affects germination at a certain rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus plus bacteria lowers the
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, maybe a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get into sticky situations there
when you try to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping up, hopefully on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've hopefully shown you, at least at
some level, that many endophytic fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: contain bacteria in a facultative bacteria
in a way that we don't quite understand if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're specialization or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that they're pretty prevalent
in terms of who's out there and who's
[SPEAKER_00]: associating with who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luteobacter strains can modulate at some
level the ability of fungi to degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material, both in very synthetic
context, but also we think in very natural
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luteobacter seems to require organic
sulfur, maybe from amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe from some other weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have like sulfolipids and stuff
that might get processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of different organic
sulfur sources that could be used by
[SPEAKER_00]: Luteobacter in the fungi in the plants,
but they can't use sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of weird compared to other
proteobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, that last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endohyphal bacteria can influence fungal
interactions with plants in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other data that I haven't
shown that we haven't really processed
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but it's taken us five years to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we finally have like transcriptomes
and dual transcriptomes and dual
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolomes for all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And expression changes when you put
bacteria with fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's what seems to be the theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Joe Spraker's work that I'll
mention in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the theme here is that a lot of these
fungi were thought to be silent secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix them with these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those secondary metabolite
clusters get turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can see the metabolites actually
showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's another cool story
there showing about how these associations
[SPEAKER_00]: actually matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, all of this work,
like none of it would have happened
[SPEAKER_00]: without a simple email to Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Betsy, she's a force of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring the bacterial side.
[SPEAKER_00]: She brings the fungal side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kayla Aron was a grad student who did a
lot of those early re-association work,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figuring out how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin was the guy that got to go to
Panama for a couple of months on the
[SPEAKER_00]: government dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Joe Spraker is a postdoc now in
Betsy's lab again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe is applying for jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joe's a good guy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing the transcriptome and
metabolome stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lab, a couple of technicians,
and Kevin Hockett helped out with this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin's now a PI at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of other postdocs and
undergraduates and a variety of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have contributed over the years to this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just get to be the lowly bacterial
geneticist and a huge team of awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the invite.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a few minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start in the photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody has any?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Host ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little more about host
ranges for those individual bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they defined by those genetically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they defined in any particular other
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I talk about host ranges for the
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a certain level, the patterns don't
make sense to me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every bacteria that I get out of that
nephritic fungi seems to be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into that 9143 isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned before, so the other thing
that I'm trying to chew in on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just finally, I think I have an
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pestilodeopsis ends up being a mess
to work with genetically and genomically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always tried to get the system
working in Neurospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those endohyphal bacteria go into
Neurospora using the assays that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've found one that I can
reassociate with Neurospora and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: gets into the hyphae of Neurospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at some level, the pestilodeopsis
can pick pseudomonas versus the endohyphal
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurospora doesn't like any of those,
but there's another one that gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurospora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's something happening
there, but I don't know the phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns of what's actually going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we talked about, I want that
Neurospora system to work because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: use so much cool stuff in that if I can
get it to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we ever find any that don't have the
bacteria in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done some sampling, and Justin's
done a lot more sampling in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed-associated ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look, somewhere between 60% and
70% seem to have bacteria, and then about
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a phylogenetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is like some have it and some
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even within the hyphal mat,
it's kind of like citrus greening where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like there's some in some places but
not in the other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to contextualize this and
maybe what is happening is there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work in the microbiome world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of plus and minus bacteria
in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take the bacteria away from mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You compare it to the notobiotic mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's completely synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the fungal world, we really do
have this natural analog of plus and minus
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria at certain spatial parts of the
hyphae, and that might matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might matter for differences in
physiology throughout the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it may be not at the specialized
level of interaction, but maybe plus and
[SPEAKER_00]: minus bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that changes what the fungi are
doing, even within a single mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so there's definitely a bunch
of, there's much hyphae out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have bacteria in them that we can
see or that we can PCR or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be something that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions from anyone
remotely?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so with that, we'll thank Dave again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have a plaque, but we do have
a bacterial spec pint glass we would like
[SPEAKER_03]: to present you with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
