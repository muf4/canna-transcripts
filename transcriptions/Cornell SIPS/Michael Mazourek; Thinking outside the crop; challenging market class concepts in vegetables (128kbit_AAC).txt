[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to do a talk that is a
little bit different than the technical
[SPEAKER_00]: talk I gave in plant breeding a couple
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on YouTube,
it's maybe in one of the channel videos
[SPEAKER_00]: around this portion of your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here today, so I just want to talk
about some things we do in more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: art side of breeding and some of the
trends and things we are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence to try to maybe give us some
more opportunities in what different crops
[SPEAKER_00]: we can breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in plant breeding, much of what we
do aligns with some grand challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding a global population, look at
sustainability in various facets,
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change, addressing malnutrition
throughout the world, and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up with evolving and dispersing pests
and pathogens that are coming to challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot we do to directly
address these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the process, the topic I want to
integrate today, and we'll explore in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple different stories, some you're
familiar with, some might be new,
[SPEAKER_00]: is reducing waste in the breeding process
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not necessarily looking at directly in
the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of the squash that is left
over from our breeding program that ends
[SPEAKER_00]: up going to the food pantry, a lot from
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been distributing the leftovers from
our genomic selection populations around
[SPEAKER_00]: before Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some direct waste, but there's
also just some wasted opportunity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main things I want to
talk today and really bring it back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market class concepts and demands of the
marketplace and to see if we can influence
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can maybe influence how much progress
we can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the main challenges we work
on, and so this is a pest, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: striped cucumber beetle, is a specialist
herbivore feeding on cucurbit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard from myself or my
student Lauren about how these beetles are
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized to feed on cucurbit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will lay their eggs at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sequester some of the bitter
compounds in the plants used for their own
[SPEAKER_00]: defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a winter like we did last
year, or it looked like we might have this
[SPEAKER_00]: year remains to be seen, we really didn't
have the killing, the really low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures to really reduce the beetle
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were swarms everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the most challenging
year for a lot of cucurbit growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really thinking about climate
change and how those mild winters are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to intensify this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the breeding perspective,
what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to think about it from
a plant breeding perspective because as we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at some of the chemical controls we
have and we've relied on, breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to these insect pests and
probably many insect pests has lost a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of attention because of the cheapness and
efficacy of a lot of the pesticides we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had that really do a really good job of
eliminating this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge and the increasing scrutiny
these pesticides have is, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: these insects are attracted to the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of nectar in the flowers,
pollen protein, and that's also where the
[SPEAKER_00]: bees are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we're starting to scrutinize
neonicotinoids and their use and how there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be some interaction with pollinator
health, having some alternative and if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can find one within the plant,
that would be an ideal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we initially approached this how many
people have before starting to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: field assays of beetle damage,
where you can see there are some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and some plots that are green and thriving
and other plants where it's noticeably,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, the plants are rather absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beetle just devoured them to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we sorted through this,
we definitely focused originally on those
[SPEAKER_00]: extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a slide we've shown a few times
before, so on the top we have a success
[SPEAKER_00]: PM, a straight neck summer squash
developed here at Cornell by my
[SPEAKER_00]: predecessor and also very popular in
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic seed is broadly available at this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom, you see a golden zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a crop where the beetles
really prefer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've defoliated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in the process, the plants have
escaped that have gotten bacterial wilt
[SPEAKER_00]: and then will die from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of people that have
looked at some of the recommendations and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out, so what kind of
grower plant is really going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a crop that will be less
vulnerable to these beetles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've often looked at different
cultivars that are popular at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took it one step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at all the different market
classes and the amount of defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: damage we saw, there's definitely a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can order the market classes
through increased damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further, where the biology really
comes into play is it turns out there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice demarcation in the middle
where of all these squash you eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins, jack-o'-lantern pumpkins,
acorn squash, zucchini, cocazell,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two different subspecies,
two separate domestication events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a clear distinction in
preference based on the same subspecies
[SPEAKER_00]: cline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top, you see the summer squash
that are getting very little damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: a member of the subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom, the zucchini,
a part of the pipo pipo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how this relates to some of the
market class questions is one thing it
[SPEAKER_00]: really comes down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two extremes I was showing,
genetically, they're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the beetles, they're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: To consumers, they're still different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to what degree could they substitute?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is that yellow summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the far side is a golden zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two yellow summer squash fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put a lasalmic marinade and put
them on the grill, how different might
[SPEAKER_00]: they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, there is a drive in the
marketplace to have these two different
[SPEAKER_00]: market classes and use them differently,
or at least the demand to have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, the zucchinis tend to be a little
bit more preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the marketplace, which is, again,
a question that comes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability because the yellow summer
squash, they have multiple flowers per
[SPEAKER_00]: node and actually much higher yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the more sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further, looking at all of the
different market classes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see for breeders, often what we do is
to try to be able to continue to make
[SPEAKER_00]: progress the most rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people do conservative crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seldom see crosses across the
subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, you'll see crosses within a
market class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the amount of gain you can stand to
make is quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite narrow, quite restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have started doing many of those
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a population between those
two contrasting squash I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the selection process here
after Lauren has gone to the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuumed up thousands of beetles to put
into these cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's some clear
preference differences as we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: segregating populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants still have full intact leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, so we're doing a cross
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one question we're going to have is,
so at what point are we going to be close
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to a golden zucchini?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this time that we're doing the
breeding, to what extent can yellow summer
[SPEAKER_00]: squash substitute in the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a market class drive we're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of being able to have just
a good summer squash, it's well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that already exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The true alternative that we are very
excited to be starting to work on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's something where I myself need to
be kind of persuaded down this road to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore, this is an Italian summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tromboncino summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of the most shot of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than being between those two
subspecies, it's own species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be used as a winter squash,
the butternut squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be enjoying this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they can be used as a summer
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our work to look at some of the climate
change aspects, we often have trials in
[SPEAKER_00]: the southeast because that's a good
predictor of the climate we might have to
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers are working through many
of those challenges now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the key differences that makes
this tromboncino more sustainable is
[SPEAKER_00]: nearest to me on the right, you have a
zucchini stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hollow and very susceptible to
squash vine bores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get in that passageway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very hard to control once they get
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your left, you have the solid stem of
one of these most shot of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just naturally much more resistant to
the vine bores because they can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: burrow in and just have a subway system
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the tromboncino is an
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of room to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where we started to get
some of the great input from the team at
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Hill and Chef Dan Barber as we look
through to see, so what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics we do need to preserve in
these tromboncino squash as we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understanding, so how can they
best be displayed in a dish?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have some different uses where
you find the tromboncino, they're much
[SPEAKER_00]: more delicious than a zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you've ever thought about
where's flavor in zucchinis, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some classes that they do have
some great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also here in a tromboncino,
you get a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of density to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this became a very popular offering
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this model is something that we have,
we're very optimistic for how it will work
[SPEAKER_00]: with the tromboncino because of the great
success we've had in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the honey nut squash you know,
hopefully know and enjoy now is here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't something that originally
took off because it looked different than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is on the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tromboncino is going to look different
than the summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers we talked to, that's one of
their major concerns is how are they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to get in the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crop they know that works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so how do you get that culinary trend
to catch on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the chef is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honey nut is a small squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a built-in ripeness indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell when it's fully ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll change from a green to an orange
rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is much more delicious,
at least I'll tell you, than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: butternut squash you'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key within that is that it has a
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick Robinson at Geneva started the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly John continued it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a cross between a butternut
squash and a buttercup squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that yielded the honey nut squash,
which as I've talked about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical aspects before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exciting crop, both for how
good it is itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much sweeter, much smoother texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it owes much of that to the buttercup
and its pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it has about twice the
beta-carotene, more than three times the
[SPEAKER_00]: lutein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as much alpha-carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really an antioxidant nutrient
powerhouse there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also been serving the basis for
further genomic selection work we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it had some challenges getting
into the marketplace and what's helping it
[SPEAKER_00]: now is that it's distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that orange rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing your garden,
it's starting out dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a while for that to catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting that popularized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when it did catch on, now we're
getting a privilege that's normally
[SPEAKER_00]: reserved for apple cultivars, where it's
sold by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grocery store, it has a skewed code
that's specific to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the work we've done in the end
of creating this really delicious is
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable so consumers can go back to
find that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can know when it's ripen at its
peak is all coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we can do,
hopefully, for many of the other varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripeness indicator is a trend we're
putting into all our squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to tell whether a
butternut squash is ripe or not otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just an example of one of the
trends that we now know we can drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple others where we are creating some
crops that don't necessarily fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: existing molds is our work with some
purple snow peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is exciting to us for the
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, of course, an antioxidant boost
that comes with the anthocyanins and
[SPEAKER_00]: associated flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a little different because
they're not perfectly ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in pea breeding, a lot of effort
has gone into making the pods perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge we find when it comes to
being able to incorporate them into food
[SPEAKER_00]: is we have a few of those in a stir fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you start to add more than a
certain amount, they start to look a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like the truckloads of firewood
that might have been dropped off at your
[SPEAKER_00]: house's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just kind of that pile of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all just kind of stack together.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, as you can see, have a curl to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this wavy nature that actually
is really cool and interesting because it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives them loft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just have much more presence,
appearance on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you are starting to work with them,
share it, it is actually just something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more interesting to work with and
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to all the work we've done on
getting the flavor to be sweet and
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome some of the astringency of those
purple flavors, there's often some
[SPEAKER_00]: bitterness and astringency associated with
the accumulation of anthocyanins in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other example where we're just having
fun and creating new types of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just trying to do some things to
really increase the market appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see those little snacking peppers that
you'll see increasingly on the vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatherings, it's great to see that they
are one of the first vegetables to go off
[SPEAKER_00]: the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can think we can increase the
consumption even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vitamin C content in these is also
through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this novelty in looking at
flavor and quality and then also being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to capture some insect disease
resistance with the trompincino.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also work we do on another
pathogen, cucurbit downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of this work I do with Chris
Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resistance we had to downy mildew,
it wasn't really an issue for many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For quite a few years, for a few decades,
there was some resistance that hadn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: bred into held really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge we faced is we started to
get some new races, some new strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen that were starting to
overcome the existing resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have some types of telltale
symptoms on a cucumber leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it occurs in an area,
it rapidly defoliates the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the bottom left, you can see
just a little bit over just 10 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease progress for this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it moves in, you go from having a
productive crop to nothing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the downy mildew resistant cultivars
that were out on the market, the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: has overcome that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And toward that, we started to do some,
this is the work of Peter Ojumbo in North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina, and looking at how we can track
the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing you can see, it's kind of
restricted to the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can watch how it moves through the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with some special emphasis,
we have been in some of the major areas in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Carolinas and Michigan, where a lot of
the pick production happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then up in our area in New York,
it often arrives later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a pathogen that's being
dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably overwintering in protected
structures around Michigan, whereas we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to have this global continuous
supply of cucumbers year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to we're growing cucumbers year
round, and the pathogen is present year
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially as tropical storms move up
the East Coast, as those increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: we often get much more and sooner the
dispersal of downy mildew up the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a pathogen that interacts
with some of our food system issues on a
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most direct way you would interact
with it is if you were growing cucumbers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that your plants just quickly
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all the regional local food markets,
all the cucumbers are lost at some point
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall, not just because of the frost
of the season is ending up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this pathogen is moving in,
and the fungicides are losing their
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy as it continues to rapidly
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been excited when we can be able
to have a major change in disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our two most resistant varieties on the
top, so varieties that are now
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available I'll talk about
now, compared to some of the other options
[SPEAKER_00]: growers had as they turned to something
that had improved downy mildew resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: or was just one of the heirlooms,
a typical crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been cucumber cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And excitingly also, and as I showed you
that map of how downy mildew is coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: the East Coast, this is a trial of the
beautiful location our collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeanine Davis has in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the foreground as downy
mildew starts to move in and take out our
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber and melon plots behind it,
you can see the site I was overjoyed to
[SPEAKER_00]: see as I pulled in is the area where we'll
show you the green patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our resistant cucumber
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's bred in New York, but it's not
just something that works in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is also really holding
up in some of the severe disease pressures
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the main cucumber producing
regions in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, and one of the backstories
with it that is exciting is often as
[SPEAKER_00]: people think about the timeline for
introducing a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, this new downy mildew resistant
line, 401, it's something that I've showed
[SPEAKER_00]: in some other talks is much higher
yielding when downy mildew is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's still alive, but also has
some competitive earliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the initial cross we did in 2012 to
take what was a later but robust disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant breeding line, this 264,
cross it to Dasher, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most commonly grown slicing cucumbers
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cross in 2012, we were doing
selections in the field in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the benefit of a couple of
generations a year using the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a selection that we were really
confident about in 2015 was out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of trials as a really preliminary
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our release just came out last week,
and so the publication of its existence is
[SPEAKER_00]: just coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's a seed company that has
it licensed, did a seed production this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that we started
the process in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be available to growers with
a specific focus on the southeast where
[SPEAKER_00]: they really need it most next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really rapid response to
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really fully finished?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do more of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in part why we're giving them these
numbered lines and not names yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are still going to be works
in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that a grower can't
really benefit from having this tool on
[SPEAKER_00]: their farms now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just continued to release
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we have something that we know
is an improvement, try to fast track that
[SPEAKER_00]: good out to the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that is something we're proud of
and seems fast on that scale, there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: something that could be even faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the sources for downy mildew
resistance we're using are things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that are, well, they're
cultivars, depending on where you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the key to much of our resistance
breeding is taking different cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that had moderate resistance, bringing
that together, and getting an even higher
[SPEAKER_00]: level of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking through some of these
cultivars, you'll see there's some Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that are grown in parts of the
world where these pathogens are endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also Indian cultivars that are
also being grown in parts of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: where some of these pathogens are endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are existing cultivars that
are fit with existing cuisines around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we can spend a lot of time
adapting these, doing some breeding to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to kind of take that resistance and
introgress it into some of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: classes we enjoy, there's also the
potential for these to be enjoyed right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and to help to diversify, to share
more broadly just how well they might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many have excellent yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done high tunnel, open field
trials with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the flavor is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it needs to be used differently
in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are still cucumbers that can be
grown now and enjoyed at least while we
[SPEAKER_00]: are at certain times of the season when
it's difficult to grow the other cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: or while we are continuing to make it into
the breeding process to introduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance into the market classes we
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really looking at some of
those aspects of the breeding process and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another opportunity that has increasingly
drawn attention, so here's a study by the
[SPEAKER_00]: NRDC, is just looking at the amount of
produce that is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just never really makes it into
our diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never makes it into our bellies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is oversupply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's often to make sure a grower
can meet a contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will produce more just to make sure
they can have that supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of what's overproduced might end up
in a landfill, something that doesn't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like you might be expecting to fit that
market class concept might end up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we've been starting to look at
some of the different ways we can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: this, again, we've taken the lead from our
great collaborator, Chef Dan Barber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his salad collaboration with sweet
greens has been a big inspiration to us in
[SPEAKER_00]: how we start to think about also how we
can change some of the attributes we're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is their salad, where it is
essentially what you might have left over
[SPEAKER_00]: on your cutting board after you make a
salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is broccoli stems, carrot peels,
you see the leaves and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brassicas that actually do make a fine
salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all edible parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was celebrated in a salad at
Sweet Greens where it ran for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: just really looking at even as we have the
harvested plant parts that come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not we choose to use them,
how can we be able to change our
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches to be able to use more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's part of it that can happen
through culinary trends and how consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the public approaches what to do with the
produce they bring home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be introduced to them in these
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also for me, as a plant breeder,
we start to increase recently starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about, so what about all these other
components of the produce that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always selecting for the best fruit
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I tried to get over the hurdle with
the tromboncino and how that was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't really fitting with my concept
of what I was going for in a butternut
[SPEAKER_00]: squash, we were going for a straight neck,
small, really sweet, then to be introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: to this long, windy squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little while for me to be able
to really realize the potential of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding work with it and how it
really fit into the food system in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the underappreciated
components in this salad, the part where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of come home to some of the
breeding and selection I've been doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself going through a squash
field, tasting more parts of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: than I ever would have imagined even a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Barbara started to tell me how I
should be doing this and how there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to breed for the flavor of the
stems of a squash plant, the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this was something where he
helped me really kind of think more
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly about what we could be selecting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, what converted me was sampling
the dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nearest to me is a Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: curvita people penne pasta, where it is
the leaf petioles of the squash plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look for a gluten-free pasta,
this is 100% gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the leaf petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's variation within squash,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some actually don't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some actually do have good flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I've gone through, through the
field and doing a lot of selections,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the key places you can really see
this can impact sustainability is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a panorama of a squash field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the side nearest to me
on the right, you see the typical loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are succumbing to powdery
mildew, even despite their breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, they senesce and go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some other species from other
parts of the world that I have growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are naturally adapted species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the breeding work we started
to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see they are still green,
vibrant, growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at my house in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could only imagine a little bit more
milder part of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have been growing just fine
probably up until maybe, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: today, last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ground is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers can harvest the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the season, or as they
are just having a succession of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really a lot of food out there in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we've gone through and learned
how to be able to do some of the sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: or kind of realize that this is a great
thing we can do, it can only have some
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's also an emphasis on learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned this from a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sort of approach in some of the
cultivars we're using, it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not new to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in many parts of the world,
this is part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are eaten, the whole plant,
in many other different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, it's been a matter of kind
of learning those cultures, learning those
[SPEAKER_00]: traditions, appreciating the value they
have and how it contributes to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability, food access, and those
parts of the world, and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: really starting to enjoy and celebrate
those opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, of course, as a plant breeder,
there's also, as we look into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these crops that are growing in much
warmer parts of the world, still there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity to adapt them to more
thrive in our parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Northeast, it will be very
different from where they're originally
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so this is learning from other
cultures, kind of getting some more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and being able to appreciate
some of the plants as they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they come from many different places of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely some breeding that
can be done, but also there's value as
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the themes I wanted to
focus on today is to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's an opportunity cost in
waiting until something is finished and
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting ourselves to this is exactly
how it needs to look in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what diversity, what potential is there
to have uniqueness, and how can it be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually drive consumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so increasingly, some of the
approaches we use as we look in how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's working well now and just
get ready access to a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on-farm trials as pilot production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we start to do our on-farm trial
work, there's often an idea that,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it'll be available later when it's
commercialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can commercialize some of the
cultivars and the breeding lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing well now, they give growers
immediate access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to have them risk their
whole farms to it, but they can certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to take a portion of their land
and be able to have something that might
[SPEAKER_00]: work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work into more land for it as we
continue to improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because before it's finished
cultivars, there's often some value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding for reduced waste, learning from
other food cultures on what are the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, parts that are used, how are they
consumed, what makes them delicious,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we be able to look at what we're
growing and be able to apply some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same and also maybe try some of those
cultivars here to see what we can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, as we can get some culinary
trends led by a chef to look at how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to take those cultivars that were
adapted now, are working really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to hopefully start some
culinary trends that can embrace that
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are things we can eat now
that will have a much greater
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability even before the breeding
process starts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to really embrace the breeding process
that's been going on for the many years to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to the state it was as we
experience it from those other parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd like to thank the
graduate students in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed quite a bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauren Brzezowski, former post-doc Brian
Leckie, and a fantastic group of graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students and post-docs in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great technical support to make
everything come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big thanks to Chef Dan Barber at
Blue Hill that's really led us as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned to explore things, explore
vegetables a little bit more bravely than
[SPEAKER_00]: we were before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of great collaborators that have
helped or we've helped with some various
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of what I've shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a great support from USDA,
NIFA, and some other funders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had one slide that showed five years
to cross to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you call up that slide?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked to me like maybe it should have
been six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it should be six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the F1 and the 264 are synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting two generations a year of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cucumber, we can get multiple
generations a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can even squeeze it to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what really helps us be able
to push it forward quickly.
Thank you.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach and then Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any
slides for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess maybe I should repeat the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question about if there's
hazards in right of rushing something to a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there might be some more durable
resistances, other progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is in kind of rushing it
to a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the considerations are they might
be losing production now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have given up on a crop
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we talked to some growers in the
Southeast, they've given up on summer
[SPEAKER_00]: squash zucchini entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that system, being able to share
something that might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't suggest they'll plant their
whole farm to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a huge risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to put in a row and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just really those exploratory
plots kind of getting them at a scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: an appropriate scale, where they can be
introducing them to their production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also at the same time, then,
they have enough to test market and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to build that following before
they take something new and novel and
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce it in a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have to be balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marcus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's in terms of culinary
trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a chef-driven trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the baby leaf lettuce and how
that's similar to the peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that provides
loft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So loft to a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we moved away from icebergs lettuce
to all these baby greens, it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually much more sustainable for
a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them more some opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many farms do we see now with high
tunnels that are growing greens year
[SPEAKER_00]: round?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not just doing one market
class or type.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have multiple different species,
families, brassicas are being mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's great diversity of leafs
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that got a lot of
its push from the chef community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions in Geneva?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have been working with some seed
companies that can kind of see a real
[SPEAKER_00]: critical way to address a need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these are ending up in more
regional seed companies that do not need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have thousands of pounds of seed,
but can do it at a much smaller scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to kind of get it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we have field days throughout the
southeast, it's attended by many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: southeast seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those are picking up some of these
varieties now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see it's starting to work well in
a region in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their seed production can also be kind
of their last proof in the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So otherwise, it is being able to convince
someone to take the plunge in something
[SPEAKER_00]: radically new.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need some more of the pull
through help.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else from Geneva before I move to
a couple here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bruce.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't focus on it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a talk in plant breeding a couple
weeks ago that really focused on much of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that should be up on YouTube now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for the people on the screen at
home, it will be hopefully in the list
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so a lot of the work we're doing there
is so genomic selection is a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: and promising tool for us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been doing genomic selection
for quality in winter squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is storability because we'll
have that the whole the whole crop cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: is one year to be able to fully evaluate
the storage of those to go from when we
[SPEAKER_00]: plant them to when the last ones come out
of storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be a huge help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be looking at the gains we've been
able to make next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, it's very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing the gains being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, that's one that kind of fits
in as we've had the intermediates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been distributing a lot of butternut
squash from that, which are all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, hopefully being received very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're already high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mixtures of fruit sizes and some
qualities and shapes, but there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: very high quality produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other major areas with the striped
cucumber beetles starting to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the reason for that subspecies
difference in beetle preference?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been focusing on F2 populations
by parental populations because the
[SPEAKER_00]: population structure for an association
study precludes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are studying the substructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to mix that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we've done that coupled with
starting to look at RNAseq to see what and
[SPEAKER_00]: using some of the new three prime
quantitative methods to look at the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: response for beetle feeding and what's
going on between those, cucurbitacins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also just some other volatiles and
other maybe anti-feeding metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that we're very proud of,
and was just accepted this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the powdery mildew resistance that was
famously done by Henry Munger here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell for cucurbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving the wild species introgression
from cucurbit and marnesii into moshata
[SPEAKER_00]: and pipo, and a key attribute in much of
the breeding that's been done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the first to have a published
publicly available marker that's so far
[SPEAKER_00]: completely co-segregates with the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very excited about how we did
that approach because rather than creating
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of populations for ourselves,
we just took advantage of the populations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we had that resistance gene that
Henry Munger did and shared throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, dozens of breeding companies
hundreds of plant breeders working on that
[SPEAKER_00]: for probably millions of meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we've been able to just genotype
what's resulted from that, the one region
[SPEAKER_00]: they share in common is a 75 KB interval,
about 75 KB, with a couple really
[SPEAKER_00]: promising candidate genes that we're now
following up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the types of studies we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be another video that
kind of summarizes all those, but this was
[SPEAKER_00]: really just looking at some of the art
behind it and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to change how we do what is
otherwise kind of an established pipeline.
Thanks, Bruce.
Yeah, Rachel.
I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the much more
preferential species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zucchini's type, that subspecies,
yeah.
Right, and you
eat preference?
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the question here was, as we're
crossing these two and we are trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: toward being able to put the
non-preference from the summer squash into
[SPEAKER_00]: the more consumer preferred market class
for the golden zucchini, how are we going
[SPEAKER_00]: to know when we're close enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be something that will be in
part up to kind of consumers, and as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing some of the intermediates with
growers, if they are being able to market
[SPEAKER_00]: it, there are some subtle flavor
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other characteristics that
might come along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably, in the end, just be a
match of the visuals, if we've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: converted it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are some culinary
differences that we can also, we'll taste
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any time for, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's a conference in 2013 that
really helped get a lot of that going,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of a much greater visibility to
the potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's increasingly, you'd see the
chef breeder interaction going,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a way to be able to capture the
creativity from both sides and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: work directly, so there's actually two
ends of the process that are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hannah, did you still have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the thing I'd be arguing is,
to what extent can we be able to move
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond that a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what other, as people think about
creating new market classes, is kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: when is something just great as it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you introduce that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the honey nut squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A miniature butternut squash was not
something that really fit into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was small and looked different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tasted really good, but it wasn't
until people really got introduced to it
[SPEAKER_00]: that it got popularized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join me in thanking Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
