[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone, my name is Kenzie
Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a PhD student at Cornell University
and today I'm with Steve Reyners.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a horticulture specialist and today
we'll talk about some pests that can be in
[SPEAKER_01]: our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve, we know that there are some
pests or diseases that can affect our
[SPEAKER_01]: fields or our vegetable gardens and we
would like to know what is a common pest
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will see and what are things that
we can recognize to know what it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a control that we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first one we're going to be
talking about today is squash vine borer
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a huge problem for home
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing zucchini you're probably
going to have squash vine borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shall I show this plant right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plant that we had and I've
just pulled it up so we just cut it right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the base of the plant here and this is,
I don't see any right here, this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: squash vine borers typically lay their
eggs and what will happen is the eggs will
[SPEAKER_00]: be laid usually within about two to three
inches of where it goes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eggs will hatch and as soon as they
hatch they will go inside the stem and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's the perfect place for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they'll do is they'll just start
feeding inside the stem and then they will
[SPEAKER_00]: start eating and pushing their frass out
behind them and you'll always be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell because you'll see some small holes
and this will just be starting to rot and
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be all this insect frass that's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually the plant will start to wilt,
eventually it will die and again that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a real problem and something that more
so probably home gardeners have a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with than commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do to control that or like
is there another way that we can use to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for a home gardener it's a little bit
more work but again since the insect is
[SPEAKER_00]: laying its eggs right here and it's not
typically laying its eggs further up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant what you can do is you can wrap
that stem and people have wrapped aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: foil around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people wrap like old pantyhose
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a floating row cover you can
take a little strip of that and wrap that
[SPEAKER_00]: around it and again it only has to be up
to about those three inches and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the insect as it's flying and it's
a moth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't really see it but I
think you'll show a picture of it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a moth that flies during the daytime
hours and will be laying its eggs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again if you wrap the stem that can
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another method that's
approved with the eggs to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use a spray it's called a dipel
spray which is a bacterial material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approved for organic farming and
organic gardening and again if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: spray that maybe every five to seven days
just right here at the base and again what
[SPEAKER_00]: will happen is as soon as those eggs hatch
before they can get into the stem they
[SPEAKER_00]: start eating and they'll eat this bacteria
and again it's naturally derived from soil
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and that will kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also cover the entire plot with
a row cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we won't see vine borers around
here until mid-June or so and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: will usually we only have one generation
so the moths the adult moths will be
[SPEAKER_00]: active from mid-June until usually the end
of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again a late planting of zucchini which
only takes about 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you planted about the first week of
August you can also get around the season
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay a really important thing with squash
vine borer as well is once you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: with your zucchini plants even if it's
wilted if it has the squash vine borer
[SPEAKER_00]: pull them out of the garden compost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find the the worms themselves
the caterpillars pull those out because
[SPEAKER_00]: they will overwinter in the soil and then
they're just going to be a problem next
[SPEAKER_00]: next spring for you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you want to make sure that you
pull up that all those old cucurbit plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have out there that'll help
really to help control it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: following year too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just learned about squash vine borer
and this is a good time for us to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do whenever we have this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much Steve for your advices
and I know that this will be very helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: for people that is harvesting or is having
their squash plants or their zucchini
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in their fields or in a garden.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
