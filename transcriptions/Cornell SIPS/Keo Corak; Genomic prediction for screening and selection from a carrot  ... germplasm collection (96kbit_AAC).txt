[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking to you today, though,
from my home and roughly where that yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: star is, where I work in an urban and
regional food systems lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that the farmers that we work
with are very diverse in their scope and
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, but our research broadly
supports farmers that are serving
[SPEAKER_01]: small-scale regional markets across the
upper Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to mention here that
Wisconsin is also home to the two working
[SPEAKER_01]: public care recruiters in the state,
in the nation, rather, and we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky to be able to work with them on this
project as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to meet the needs of the
farmers we work with who value things like
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor and weed competitiveness,
as well as open pollinated varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're interested in being able to use
germplasm from the USDA care collection in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to introduce traits that are of
interest to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carrots in this collection are
relatively unstructured and carrot itself
[SPEAKER_01]: is an out-crossing diploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also hoping that the approach that
we're taking can serve as kind of a case
[SPEAKER_01]: study or a proof of concept approach for
other groups that are interested in using
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm collections in breeding,
but need methods to be able to do so
[SPEAKER_01]: deliberately and efficiently in order to
be successful whatever the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I begin to talk about the approach
that we're using, I did want to touch just
[SPEAKER_01]: briefly on one of the traits that we're
interested in a little bit more in depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'll be referencing it again
throughout the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so canopy height is simply the
measurement between the soil on the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the longest petiole, and we're interested
in this because it's positively correlated
[SPEAKER_01]: with weed competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is something that's really important
to a lot of our growers, many of whom are
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and spend a lot of time and
effort, especially earlier in the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: managing weeds in their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a phenotype we're able to easily
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have methods both for whole plot
phenotyping in the field, and then using
[SPEAKER_01]: barcode rulers and scanners, we can
quickly do single plant phenotyping in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to discuss a little bit
about our approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're interested in using genomic
prediction and broadly genomic assisted
[SPEAKER_01]: selection in order to quickly identify
useful germplasm from a collection while
[SPEAKER_01]: minimizing the need for extensive field
screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this work, we're really drawing
on two sources of inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that of core collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, usually these were, and this was,
these are methods used, that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: used to reduce the size of collections
that need to be screened in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically they've been based in phenotypes
or passport information.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the increasing accessibility of low
cost markers, however, many germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: curators are able to genotype the entire
collections, making them amenable to
[SPEAKER_01]: things like genomic prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last five years or so,
there has been an increased interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: using genomic prediction in germplasm
collections, but most of these studies
[SPEAKER_01]: have been based on simulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really want to do is directly
compare phenotypic and genomic assisted
[SPEAKER_01]: selection by developing breeding
populations using different methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then taking them into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just really briefly, one slide on the
prediction models we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are kinship-based methods in which
we're building models by regressing
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes on markers in order to
calculate breeding values of untested
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's our experimental design.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are comparing three different selection
strategies, two different flavors of
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic assisted selection against
phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for each of these, we're taking
five highly ranked accessions for each
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy-trade combination to see harsh
flavors on the screen where I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: time to talk about that today,
but it's another thing that we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of these accessions is being
crossed to two popular inbreds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be thought of as either
biological replicates or kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these are progressed to the F2
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the phenotypic selection is serving as
kind of our current standard approach
[SPEAKER_01]: using data from Hancock, Wisconsin a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first flavor of the genomic selection
worked around the genomic breeding values
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy in which we're using available
breeding program data to calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding values for untested accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of racing through these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more than happy to talk more in detail
about these strategies later in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, we are also working with
the genomic training population strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: in which we identified a genetically
representative training population,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we then phenotyped in our target
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one maximized the relationship
between the test and the training
[SPEAKER_01]: population, which can dramatically
increase predictive accuracy of models,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it did require an extra year of
phenotyping before breeding could begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'm gonna talk about just some of
the results we've been able to achieve so
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the main thrust of this work is
going to be the comparison of breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad to report we just got
approval to actually have a field season
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, which wasn't clear a few weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we have some pilot data,
we're going to be able to dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: increase that next year by doing a
replicated trial of these breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: populations and measuring them for the
traits we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we were developing our genomic training
population strategy, we also were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: test different parameters of the training
population using cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we looked at was both composition
and also relative size compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: total collection, which is what you see
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, and this has become
somewhat of a pet project of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're beginning to analyze intra-accession
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So observationally, we note a fair degree
of heterogeneity within a given accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think moving forward, the success of
this type of approach is going to rest not
[SPEAKER_01]: only on improving strategies to exploit
variation between accessions, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: methods to quantify and track diversity
within accessions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in closing, we believe that
genomic-assisted selection can help small
[SPEAKER_01]: programs use genetic resources more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're finding is that high
prediction accuracy seems to require large
[SPEAKER_01]: training populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even moderate accuracy still may be
useful to programs who really just need to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the number of accessions that
they're screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our future work will compare
phenotypic and genotypic selection in more
[SPEAKER_01]: detail, and we'll continue to track
intra-accession diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'd like to thank people who
have really been invaluable to this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Kao.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll be taking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing in the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to go ahead and raise your
hand, and you can ask a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Hannah Jeffrey has a
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go ahead and unmute yourself,
Hannah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, about how large do you
think your training populations will need
[SPEAKER_04]: to be in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what kind of statistical modeling have
you implemented to try to predict what
[SPEAKER_04]: size it will have to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you still hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what I'm looking at right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw a pretty dramatic improvement in
prediction accuracy when we increased the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of our training populations relative
to the total size of the collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm seeing another question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many germplasm do you work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were using about 470 cultivated
accessions within the germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the training population that we
phenotyped was 10% of that size,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is consistent with previous
literature that looked at core collections
[SPEAKER_01]: that were roughly 10% the size of the
total collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's interesting is how
dramatically accuracy did increase when we
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the relative size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jumping from 10% to 20% had a large
effect on prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second part of your question
is, how did we look at that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one graph in the results section
that I showed showed how we had a data set
[SPEAKER_01]: of accessions for which we had data for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used cross validation to mask a
percentage of that that served as our test
[SPEAKER_01]: population and then used the remaining as
the training population in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict the test group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to do that many times
with many different training populations
[SPEAKER_01]: of a given size calculated in the same way
in order to calculate the mean and
[SPEAKER_01]: variance of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful for me as a student.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you answered how many germplasms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mark Sorrels, would you like to unmute
yourself and ask your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't your phenotypes compounded by the
percent header zygosity in individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shorter answer is probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're working with single
genotypes per accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an out-crossing species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a degree of heterozygosity
within accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found with some preliminary
analysis is that level of heterozygosity
[SPEAKER_01]: also varies across accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think future work, it's going to be
really important to follow up with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and be able to account for percent
heterozygosity in our predictions.
