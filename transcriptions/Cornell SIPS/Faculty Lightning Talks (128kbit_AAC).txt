[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you, Gillian, first for the
invitation and Joss and Lou for organizing
[SPEAKER_01]: these across all the sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Gaurav Moghe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Mumbai, India and did my
bachelor's in microbiology, my master's in
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I came here in 2007 at Michigan State
where I did my postdoc, PhD and postdoc
[SPEAKER_01]: and joined Cornell in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my lab here is working on various
aspects of plant biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about two projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a more computational project on
predicting enzyme function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is more wet lab aspects of
things where we are looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms behind stress response,
mainly in sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main motivation for many of the
projects in the lab is that there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge diversity of plant metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because of the complexity of
the underlying metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of these are not completely
characterized or the regulation is poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what are some of the challenges for
this pathway discovery?
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that now we can sequence any
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can sequence any genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even polyploid genomes, it's easier to
sequence than before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gene functions in most of these
genomes are very poorly defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do an RNA-Seq or a QPL analysis in
each QPL or RNA-Seq data, you see hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of genes, dozens of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But which of those genes are really
important for a given function?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not clearly understood because you
don't know the functions very well,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in nonmodal organisms where
there aren't a lot of genetic resources
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the type of genes that are affected
by these are enzyme families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because metabolic enzymes, because they're
part of large enzyme families.
[SPEAKER_01]: The function inference is difficult here
because across large evolutionary
[SPEAKER_01]: distances, the sequences change and
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't take something from
arabidopsis and try and predict the
[SPEAKER_01]: function in some other species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an illustration of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a large family in which only
two genes are characterized, arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_01]: and rice, you want to predict the function
of a tomato ortholog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't predict that because a lot of
duplicates and speciations have occurred
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also allelic diversions and
promiscuity that's present in enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads to missing annotations,
incomplete annotations, or wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: annotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very prevalent problem in all
sequence genomes, even in arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we are trying to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our model family is this family called the
BHDSL transferase family, which does a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into all the biochemical
details, but this family has expanded
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in algal species, you see just one to
three copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in dicots, monocots, you see dozens to
hundreds of copies in each genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are poorly annotated.
[SPEAKER_01]: In tomato, these are some of the genes,
some of the BHDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only 12 out of these BHDS are
substrate-class annotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are just characterized as
HXS-D-type acertransferases.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not just acertransferases.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they exactly doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What substrate do they use?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we reasoned is that if we increase
the density of annotated functions across
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree, then we can probably predict the
tomato ortholog better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that only arabidopsis and
rice have been characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them have been characterized,
but they are in papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not in databases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can't really find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last few years, we have several
publications on this particular fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is called FungFetch,
or the workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this tool, essentially, our workflow,
what we did was we used ChatGPT,
[SPEAKER_01]: or GPT, the brains behind ChatGPT,
to read papers instead of doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a whole workflow where we
screened 27,000 abstracts from PubMed,
[SPEAKER_01]: read thousands of papers, and extracted a
bunch of activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we removed hallucinations and
did all fun stuff, which took several
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that resulted in is an increase in
the density of the enzyme functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't go into all the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the existing annotation
in tomato, there are only 12 BHDs out of
[SPEAKER_01]: 100, which have their functions
characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our previous paper, in 2022,
we did manual curation of these BHDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from papers on that, based on the
similarity, after increasing the density,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can increase the number to 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after compiling database using
FungFetch, we can increase that number to
[SPEAKER_01]: 58 out of 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just by taking what has already been
done over the last three decades,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can increase the functions by quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just an example of BHDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this for other sets of genes,
et cetera, too, as long as we can put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in orthologous groups and then analyze it
in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, we are exploring the other
applications of this tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also sharing this data with global
databases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're collaborating with Uniprot,
Plant Metabolic Network, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people all over the world will be able
to use these highly curated data sets once
[SPEAKER_01]: they have their set of candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the second project, we are working a
lot on sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into reasons why we are working
on sweet potatoes, but we started seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: very interesting phenotypes, and we
started growing them in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two different varieties that
are started at two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One we grew in Albany, near Albany,
and one in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started at the same time from the same
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the huge difference in the
root size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly, the second year,
the order was switched between the two
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the sizes were switched,
and we really don't know what exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: caused this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to a whole set of experiments
that we are trying to still figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what is causing this difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why sweet potatoes are
attractive in New York state is because in
[SPEAKER_01]: the South where they're grown,
there are a lot of diseases and pest
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in New York, most of the cultivation
is organic, and there's a market for diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of varieties and food
colors, health foods, which can be tapped
[SPEAKER_01]: into if we can grow sweet potatoes under
organic cultivation in New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have done this experiment where we
grew sweet potatoes under different
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also supplemented them with arbuscular
microlip fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like it had an effect in
managing the drought responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much in regular water and high
water, but we see improvements in leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, as well as root length based on
if we inoculate them with AMFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a result from just today morning,
11 o'clock, where Terepara grad student in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab is looking at, again, root growth
under water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under low water, we can see increased
tuberization of the roots and increased
[SPEAKER_01]: root length, which is expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But increased tuberization is a bit
surprising, which indicates that the
[SPEAKER_01]: drought response and the tuberization
pathways are overlapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would want to figure out what's
happening exactly to make the sweet potato
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation more resilient to water
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect we are looking into is
these class of compounds called resin
[SPEAKER_01]: glycosides, which provide defense against
nematodes, fungi in sweet potato roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: and many other convalescent species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are important for medicinal
properties, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to figure out their
biosynthetic pathways and the diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: different sweet potato cultivars so we can
breed for more resilient, pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant, and nematode resilient sweet
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have contributed to our
research and can take any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a metabolite?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a metabolite?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say metabolite, it is basically
something that's a small molecule that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So proteins, we don't consider them as
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proteins are not detected easily using the
type of LC-MS that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are basically ignored from our
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of our scans are less than 2,000
Daltons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So secondary, primary, both.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as they're smaller than 2,000
Daltons is what we estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your bioinformatics pipeline, is it plant
specific?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the extent of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is plant specific right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do use taxonomy as a filter for
removing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hallucinations that we see,
in fact, we can see the paper is from a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is like barley or oat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the GPT algorithm is pulling out human
enzymes or rat enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the compounds associated with
testosterone, which are obviously not
[SPEAKER_01]: present in barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is hallucinations that it's
getting from its training data at drug
[SPEAKER_01]: bank and other sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the other abiotic stresses?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, we are looking at
water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the abiotic stresses?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to right now only water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, cold stress is one for sweet
potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what we want to do with AMFs is
see if we can increase the sweet potato
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're transplanted into the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're transplanted in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the growth period is still early
October.
[SPEAKER_01]: While in the south, it goes from end of
April to October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can increase it by 15,
20 days even and make the potatoes more
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient, to late frost, then we could
increase the cultivation time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cold stress is one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you didn't tell us what you do for fun
when you're not doing research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch a lot of TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next week, I'm going to Grand Canyon
and Sedona and doing some fun things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for having me here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the prompt, I'm Kelly Robbins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born and raised in Knoxville,
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I got my PhD, I went into industry
for eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came here to Cornell in 2015 as
a senior research associate and then
[SPEAKER_00]: switched over to tenure track position in
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I had kids, I enjoyed playing
hockey and golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I have kids, my pastimes are
primarily gymnastics, ballet, playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: dolls, and watching cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the Robbins lab,
so just at a high level, so we apply
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative genetics, genomics,
and computational science with this
[SPEAKER_00]: primary focus on improving the efficiency
of crop breeding programs and increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: our understanding of complex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about the work we do at a
bit of a high level in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my training is primarily in statistics
and mathematics and modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do love doing the modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really enjoy, and the reason
why I kind of identify as a plant breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I don't really spend much time
in a field or with plants for that matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because I really enjoy working with
breeding programs to figure out how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually implement advanced modeling
techniques and new technologies to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiency of breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are collaborations where
generally I'm working with breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always start with these
discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two really kind of key
components that go into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what I call the breeding strategy,
which is what is it we're predicting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we use those predictions within
the context of genetic proven program?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the prediction strategy,
which is more on the modeling side,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what data, what technologies,
and what mathematical, statistical,
[SPEAKER_00]: machine learning methodologies we're
actually going to use to make predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two things kind of feed off each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really have a good sense of
both of them to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of from a
perspectives article we published,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it was a while ago now,
where based off of both my experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry working with these really large
breeding programs in a multinational,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the sort of contrasting
experience that we had had working with
[SPEAKER_00]: public sector breeding programs,
which tend to be a little bit smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with a lot more diverse crops,
is kind of looking at how do we take what
[SPEAKER_00]: I might call a traditional breeding
program and move it into much more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: data-driven highly optimized and efficient
breeding process to implement genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had sort of broken it up into
these phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really work across all of these
phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of work on the informatics
side, which is when you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding program, just giving them a
model that's really accurate isn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be put into operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding programs have lots of
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of time, in terms of the
expertise they may have available within
[SPEAKER_00]: the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of work on partnering with
breeding programs to say, OK, what do we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to provide you in terms of
computational resources, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: software, to be able to actually implement
the stuff that we're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with them to look at what their
actual breeding pipeline looks like as it
[SPEAKER_00]: is and how we might have to change or
re-optimize that pipeline to take the best
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of new technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for really advanced breeding
programs, this idea of being able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: so response to selection is going to be a
function of the genetic architecture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trait, obviously, but also how quickly
you can make decisions and how accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do a lot of work on given what
we can do, how can we make decisions as
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately and as rapidly as possible
within a breeding program?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the grand challenges that we
have right now and why it's a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a quantitative geneticist is that a
traditional breeding program operates
[SPEAKER_00]: under this paradigm where you generate new
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test them across a sampling of the
environments that you expect to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make decisions based off of
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get from that sampling of
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based off that, you make
decisions on what crosses you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make, which lines you're actually going to
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is this concept of what we
might call overall yield, but also this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of yield stability, which is an
environment's not a fixed thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a random sampling from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get something a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeders would call them racehorse
versus workhorse varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a workhorse variety would be
represented by those blue dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a line that isn't great,
but it seems to have fairly consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: performance across a range of
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they might call a racehorse hybrid
would be, or a variety would be one that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put it in really good conditions,
man, it does great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as it starts getting stressed,
it falls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what the target
environmental regions are, maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: racehorse is what you want, or maybe the
workhorse is what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, what you'd want is a line that
just yields across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that that's really possible
if you really think about how G by E
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's something that's always been
important, but it's starting to become
[SPEAKER_00]: even more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with a lot of breeding
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk with them, it's not
necessarily the fact that we expect to see
[SPEAKER_00]: mean shifts in environments that concern
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually quite, just using the
methods they use, they're quite capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the fact that as environments are
going to change in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to start to see higher
frequencies of the more extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this idea of finding lines that
perform well in the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: environments even if they're not so great
in the very rare extreme environments is
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer going to be the paradigm we work
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have varieties that are capable
of maintaining good yield under I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what a normal environment is these
days in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's not going to fall apart as
you hit some of these extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just kind of set up at a
high level sort of how we operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of think about,
what I would call, prediction scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take data and I kind of predict what's,
or I make inference about what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a traditional breeding program
typically operates in this, oh wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is extended desktop, typically
operates in this known by known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a traditional breeding program,
you generate a lot of new lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them out into what we call
multi-environmental trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how they perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite effective as long as you have a
big enough program and you can sample
[SPEAKER_00]: enough environments to be a representative
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite powerful from a modeling
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit boring because it's
relatively straightforward modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just using simple linear models works for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another scenario which is the
scenario that is what we would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: call genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomic selection with this idea of
trying to make decisions faster to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you have some known set of
target environments that are characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're trying to predict these
performance in these unknown sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of work in international ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a common scenario you have is that
ecoregions, cultural preferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer preferences don't tend to fit
nicely within national, state,
[SPEAKER_00]: regional borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so oftentimes we'll have a region
where there's multiple national breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that have some overlapping
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, even though they have
a mandate to only work within their
[SPEAKER_00]: borders, sometimes it's more efficient to
be able to exchange germplasm across those
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work with these programs to
understand what their germplasm pools are,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how much G by E there is,
and work with them to design optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding strategies that allow them to
very strategically share germplasm between
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to maximize genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there's the holy
grail, I guess, of quantitative genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really getting at some of these
climate challenges, which is it takes 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 20 years to release a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to be breeding for varieties
that are going to be doing really well 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 20 years from now, we have to start
being able to predict how new germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're making that maybe we haven't
even seen in the field is going to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: across a range of environments that we
might forecast to be in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets into sort of predicting
unknown germplasm in unknown environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had some results here,
kind of out of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been reasonably successful in doing
some of these things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I think I'm about out of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just say one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do do a lot of work on developing these
types of computational tools to get
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're in the business of predicting
the future, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at the trajectories of the
public sector and private sector breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: programs, how do you think it's going to
play out going forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's going to be increased
interaction?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there always be distinct space?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the future hold for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's always going to be a
distinct space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on the commercial side,
right, at the end of the day, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be profitable, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain crops in certain
markets where you can be very profitable,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even within a company,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I worked for a company, worked across
a lot of crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 80% of everything went to maize,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then soybean, canola kind of got the
next tier leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was some cotton out there
somewhere that I never even worked with,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you talk about staple food,
food crops, and you talk about crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: like so rice and wheat, for example,
right, where there's not necessarily these
[SPEAKER_00]: great value capture mechanisms,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are going to continue for
the foreseeable future to be dominated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the public sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another question about breeding
for a Zinian trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have the QP and GBAS,
they tend to find these high effect size
[SPEAKER_01]: loci, which cause a big change in the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the phenotype itself is affected by a
lot of small size loci.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering how relevant are these
small effect size loci in breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, do you think they might have
an application in adapting to the extremes
[SPEAKER_00]: of the GBAS horizon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is this idea of small
effect loci, versus large effect loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: how important are the small effect loci?
[SPEAKER_00]: For many traits, it's all small effect
loci, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of quantitative genetics is built
off of what we call the infinitesimal
[SPEAKER_00]: model, right, which is this assumption
that there is an infinitely large number
[SPEAKER_00]: of genes with infinitely small effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just the sum total of all
those things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have a large effect QTL
with a lot of smaller effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, the sum total of all those smaller
effects can still be quite big,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if the end individual effects are
not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a case where we might have some
moderate to large effects and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: small effects, essentially what you do is
you would apply marker assisted selection
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and fix the large effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would use these more
quantitative measurements to then push the
[SPEAKER_00]: more quantitative traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to get into a lot of
the more complex traits, large to moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, they can be very context
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be background specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do end up focusing a lot of
work on the smaller effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, as a quantitative geneticist,
that's primarily where I work,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my introduction, my name is
Vipin Kumar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a faculty member with Soil and Crop
Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here for two years with Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually finished two years this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Cornell, I was at Kansas State
University as a faculty member.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my appointment is a research and
extensions, split up in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I work a lot of work with producers on
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: My program, I'm just gonna, just a
disclaimer, I don't have a lot of data,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just gonna give you an overview of the
things we are doing in my program,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the education we are doing with
the stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it's a weed science program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working with the weeds on
wondered plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on new weed species that
has arrived in the New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two I have listed here, Palmerum
wrenth and waterhemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two big weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first two picture you see,
the Palmerum wrenth.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were pictures taken last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: New arrival, new reports from Yates and
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person you see is Mike Stanyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our extension leader from Wharton,
New York, who basically identified those
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and helped us to collect some of
these Palmerum wrenth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Palmerum wrenth and waterhemp,
those are two most troublesome weeds
[SPEAKER_02]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are new to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are trying to criticize and
educating our stakeholders what those are,
[SPEAKER_02]: how they look like, and what we can do to
manage those.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are two big weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very far spreading in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have almost 21 different counties where
waterhemp has been reported in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have six different counties where
Palmerum wrenth has been reported from New
[SPEAKER_02]: York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, we are collecting these
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of my program is looking at the
herbicide resistance in these different
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds species.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a statewide survey being sponsored
by New York corn and soybean growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the Cornell Cooperative Ag
Experiment Station Hatch dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea behind the screening work is to
look for the distributions and the
[SPEAKER_02]: frequency of resistance population across
the state and kind of come up with the map
[SPEAKER_02]: for the state and educate our producers
where these resistant populations are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we can do to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures I have put there,
these are dose response studies we have
[SPEAKER_02]: done on waterhemp as well as on annual
ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you probably know annual ryegrass
is grown for cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some annual ryegrass showing
resistance to glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are new reports in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly for waterhemp, we have eight to
12-fold resistance recently found in our
[SPEAKER_02]: New York population.
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture you see here on my side is my
graduate student holding a
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate-resistant waterhemp in a grower
field in Seneca County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the growth in seed
production it's going to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this grower has been facing the
challenge of this species over the last
[SPEAKER_02]: five, six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, you have worked on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a lot of seed bank in these
fields with the grower field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other species of interest, as I said,
Palmer waterhemp, we are also testing
[SPEAKER_02]: horseweeds, common ragweed, velvet leaf,
some grasses like foxtails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of long-term project we
have initiated and hoping to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: better look across the state over the next
five, six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some pictures showing some annual
ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are growers' field where we got
these pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to terminate these annual
ryegrass with ronda, with glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_02]: and were not successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are testing these and we have found
pretty high-level resistance in these
[SPEAKER_02]: annual ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to educate them if they're
growing these cover crops, how to handle,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to manage, and how to terminate,
and how to get proactive to tackle these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just I said, we are not just identifying
problems for producer, but also developing
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of my program is looking at
alternative herbicide programs,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can use, especially conventional
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are testing and doing a lot of on-farm
trials with the producers, looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: different pre- and post-applied
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different pre-mixes, different tech mixes
they can use to control these
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate-resistant weed populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not showing a lot of data here,
but this is a PhD student who is involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in these work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemical-based weed control is common,
and that's what I just showed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but how about integrator weed management?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking some innovative tools,
how we can integrate in our field crop or
[SPEAKER_02]: field cropping systems in the state,
and we are testing some of the new tools
[SPEAKER_02]: like harvest weed seed control,
the picture you see here, the combine,
[SPEAKER_02]: having a ready crop seed impact mill on
the back of the combine, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically destroy the weed seeds when you
use it at the time of a crop harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a novel concept, been adopted in
Western Australia in wheat production
[SPEAKER_02]: system, but not much data in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the unit we have, and we are trying to
test here in the New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other tools we are looking at,
interrow mowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most common tool or favorite tool for
organic producers, but we are also looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for conventional producer if they can use
these tools, such as interrow mowing and
[SPEAKER_02]: suppress or control some of those weed
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, electrical weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been doing this work in
collaboration with Dr. Matt Ryan,
[SPEAKER_02]: group with Soil and Crop Sciences,
looking at the electrocutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: shocking these weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much weed suppression we can get with
electric weeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these tools we are checking side by
side in comparison to our herbicide,
[SPEAKER_02]: effective herbicide options like Liberty
and ListOne.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this study we are comparing these side
by side comparisons as well as like
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-tactic layers, having those tools
together throughout the season,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what kind of impact we see on the seed
bank over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other aspects we are looking in my program
is integrating other tools, as I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops and precision ag tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to develop digital
technologies and tools that can be used
[SPEAKER_02]: for site specific or target weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been partnering with USDA ARS from
Maryland looking at developing the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: image database as well as phenotyping for
the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using 2Ds and 3Ds cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole idea behind this project is
to come up with some decision support
[SPEAKER_02]: tools for the scouting purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are developing these technologies in
collaboration with USDA ARS folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh, stand already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my last slide is just the overall
vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, we are working on identify
identifying resistance, but we are also
[SPEAKER_02]: developing integrated weed management
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole vision of the program is to
integrate these tactics, not just relying
[SPEAKER_02]: on chemicals, but looking at other
non-chemical tools, novel tools like
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical tools as well as precision ag
tools to come together or bring together
[SPEAKER_02]: as an integrated approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have knowledge about those
different tactics standalone, but how
[SPEAKER_02]: about all together what kind of
information we can extract that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used to develop some decision support
tools to help producers to make those
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions for weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of folks to acknowledge here,
funding agencies as well as collaborators
[SPEAKER_02]: and colleagues from Cornell as well as
other institutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Palmer Amarant is still,
there is only a handful of farms in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we still have a chance to
maybe keep it out of New York,
[SPEAKER_04]: keep it in the United States with scouting
and maybe with collaboration with the
[SPEAKER_04]: state, state governments or 20
governments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as I said, these are new species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Palmer is arrived like first report was
2019 and now we have six different
[SPEAKER_02]: counties and these are just handful of
fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are chance and as per my
knowledge, like other states, we are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same boat, like North Dakota is doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are putting Palmer Amarant is a
noxious species and the state has come
[SPEAKER_02]: together as a community approach to
eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it, but how serious we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still trying to educate producers
that how serious this problem is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Palmer Amarant is one of the worst weed
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know Palmer Amarant,
you don't know weed science, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two third of the literature in weed
science is on Palmer Amarant, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that tells the seriousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to your question, I think there are
chances and it needs a community approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only from agencies and institutes,
but also from the stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: How they come together and that's what we
are doing over the winters, educating them
[SPEAKER_02]: what it looks like, where we see this
because most of these producers I
[SPEAKER_02]: interact, they don't know what is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the basic knowledge gap there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's possible, but we have to be
proactive, actually more reactive now than
[SPEAKER_02]: proactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for this audience, do you ever see
pathogens of Palmer Amarant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pathogens, you mean biological control?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, do you ever see in the fields seeds
facing the weeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: That acts as a problem for them
propagating to crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know on the Palmer,
but yeah, diseases are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing these extension meetings
with our pathologist, retired pathologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are new things coming, showing
across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not only weeds or diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say this is in general for the
pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are emerging challenges for our
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why it's happening, a lot of things
are happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winters, this winter is pretty cold,
but overall last few years, the winter was
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are moving, a lot of movement from
across the state, from state to state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are also bringing some of these
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say there are a lot of emerging
issues, emerging pest issues that needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: be taken care of not from the state
standpoint, but from regional standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Northeast states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love playing cricket, just so you
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
