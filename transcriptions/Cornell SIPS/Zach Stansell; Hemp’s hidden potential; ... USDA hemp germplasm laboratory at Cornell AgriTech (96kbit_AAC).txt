[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fantastic to be back in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can read so that I don't need to
read the title of my talk, but I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: just tell you about a lot of different
hemp work that's happening in Geneva right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just begin with a little bit of
intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of background about me and
hemp in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk about the status of the
germplasm collection in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of three topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we phenotype hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of data are we collecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the range and distribution of that
data look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab places a pretty big emphasis on
developing tools and methods as we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: public service agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the long-term projects we
can push on that will provide a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: value to everyone else long-term?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fun and exciting to me to be
able to do that and tell you about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, genotyping efforts on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 200 years ago, I mean in 2020,
I was a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my A exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my A exam in this very room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm dealing with a little bit of
trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had such a wonderful opportunity to
learn from Thomas Bjorkman and his deep
[SPEAKER_00]: and wide knowledge and wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so much fun exploring the genetic
diversity of broccoli together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A broccoli slide and a hemp talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the work that we did,
some of the varieties we looked at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the population structure is on the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had the dubious distinction of going
viral on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I woke up with like 14,000
notifications on my phone one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I have become a curator and a
geneticist at the University USDA Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic Resources Unit in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like a continuation of a lot
of the work and knowledge that I gained
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's so many things to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to cover them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to stress that nearly
everything I'm going to discuss today is
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to give everybody credit
for the contributions that they've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please know, in many cases,
I'm just supporting their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to put a cheeky emphasis on is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually kind of a more subtle
question than it might immediately seem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a legal definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of hemp, so below 0.3% total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's always a great way to engage
people to put a biochemical pathway slide
[SPEAKER_00]: on a presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing this because I like to
torture audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broadly, we can talk about this quote,
unquote, B locus with two alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to oversimplify this a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our two most famous cannabinoids,
CBD and THC, are decarboxylated from an
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two acidic forms are converted
from a common molecule, which they compete
[SPEAKER_00]: for, CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we've looked at compared total THC
versus total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find this pretty dramatic pattern
when you look at a lot of diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about these three chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the BT-BT allele,
which is THC dominant, mostly THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have two copies of the other
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can be heterozygous for both
of those alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has very profound implications on
the types of cannabinoids that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: observe in a given individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of the critical point is
that the legal threshold is set at 0.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note that all chemotypes can run hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below that line is hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above that line is marijuana, as far as
our current laws and regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dioecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within hemp, you have distinct male
individuals and female individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals with pistolet flowers and
stamenate flowers, except when it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the bonkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But exciting thing about hemp is there
always seems to be an exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these two pictures that I took
about a week ago of two individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left is a female inflorescence with
anthers protruding out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is an individual with
both female and male inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to be said about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take many people smarter
than me to disentangle this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the crops we curate in Geneva
are insect pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about all these different
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a relatively straightforward
process to create pure seeds from those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them, transplant them into a
field, put an insect exclusion cage over
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, introduce a pollinator,
allow random mating to occur, come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and collect the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just not possible with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp pollen is about 22 microns in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on who you ask, it can
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 kilometers by wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some debate about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the take home message is we cannot
trust outdoor regenerations of given
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to use greenhouses and growth
chambers and expensive and harder
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp is considered a short day where
the length of the night regulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from vegetative state to
reproductive state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any guesses what the next thing is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Except when it's not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's almost certainly more to the
story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some wonderful work kind of
mapping the genetic control of that
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the complete story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's temperature and cultural
conditions and stress that are all
[SPEAKER_00]: crosstalking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knowledge, this has not been
disentangled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also photoperiod insensitive
varieties that just flower immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multipurpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a wonderful slide in the
Cornell Hemp Handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my knowledge, there's no crop that
you can produce more different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: products from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the organs of the plant,
you can make all kinds of things from
[SPEAKER_00]: construction material to fibers,
geotextiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the wood, the herd,
to make construction materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds can be very rich and abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different fatty acids, omega-3s,
et cetera, that can be used in industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: processes or food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has medicinal and recreational
properties, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things are part of the
biology and part of how humans utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not even a comprehensive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another point that I want to kind
of impress on everyone, that I collected
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin long data from different herbaria
collections, iNaturalist, Gbif,
[SPEAKER_00]: other collections over time and plotted
this data out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis has a cosmopolitan
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's globally distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these different environments,
it's undergone artificial selection by
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are making selections for
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in many places, hemp or cannabis
has become naturalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's undergone natural selection in
these different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a proliferation of genetic
diversity in this one single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the story with the hemp
germplasm collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're part of the national plant
germplasm system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is approximately 20 gene banks
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we maintain about 600,000 active
accessions that a breeder or researcher
[SPEAKER_00]: can request today via an online portal
called Green Global.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Geneva, we maintain a lot of really
fantastic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the largest apple collection in
the world, outright, full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We maintain cold hardy grapes,
13,000 unique vegetable accessions across
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12 or 13 genre, depending on how you
count it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp was added to this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really began this work in 2020 in
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp has been around in the previous
iteration of NPGS, the plant introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had received materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is likely from the Vavilov collection
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PI numbers count up sequentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in the 600,000s now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is PI 948.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collection is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are our objectives here in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost is to try to do our
best to capture all of this genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's accessions from all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, with all different
selective pressures that have acted upon
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So capturing seeds from these different
accessions, storing them under optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: seed storage conditions, backing them up
in secondary or tertiary gene banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the seeds we make in Geneva will
find their way to the Svalbard Seed Vault
[SPEAKER_00]: in Norway, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We distribute regulatory compliant
germplasm to an international community at
[SPEAKER_00]: no cost to provide unique alleles
diversity to breeders to help them develop
[SPEAKER_00]: locally adapted and climate change
resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage a database which populates a
website that's full of phenotypic and
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic information that the public,
mostly breeders and researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: can access and use that to help empower
their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we develop data tools and
methods that we believe will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term value to the broader research
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the traits that we're focusing on
right now are plant architecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has pretty profound implications on
breeding and ultimately agronomic
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering time is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a plant transitions from a
vegetative state to a reproductive state,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really grow much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It diverts its energy into making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So later flowering varieties tend to make
greater biomass and higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding this flowering trait is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary metabolites, so this is
absolutely essential to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: excessions that are regulatory compliant,
that stay consistently below this 0.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also identifying unique cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these gentlemen, for example,
are working on that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, fatty acids, proteins, what's the
total amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky to work with some other USDA
labs that are looking into this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a USDA group in New Orleans and
Mississippi that are thinking a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in fiber quality in the stems of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're providing them all kinds of
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identifying an accession with really
fantastic fiber quality and really awful
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross them, make an F2 population,
and look how the progeny segregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can identify genes that control
things like fiber findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an infographic of the excessions
in our collection right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about up to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these come from central,
eastern, southeastern Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadly, there's debate, but central Asia
is the center slash centers of
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And following this Babylonian model,
probably where the most genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we place a very high emphasis on land
races from Nepal, northern Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tibet, those kinds of regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a kind of distribution about the
germplasm by geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the collection has grown over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, we really began adding
materials at the beginning of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's growing pretty rapidly and
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to update this graph, actually,
because it's probably going to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: over 700 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the seed samples that
we've distributed to different breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been pretty consistent
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, what we believe, a pretty strong
backed up demand for diverse hemp germ
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am legally required to talk about Green
Global and give you a crash course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever had a
librarian come to your class and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: use the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than books.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a similar effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I've gone to Green Global.
[SPEAKER_00]: That QR code takes you to this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm running a search here for cannabis
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look for unique accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's New York Feral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first accession added to our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was donated by the Smart Lab at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this accession is available
because it has the blue shopping cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click that cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds will find their way to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also collect a lot of metadata or
passport information.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, every accession has their own web
page that aggregates all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this accession was collected on what
was described as a colonial era hemp farm
[SPEAKER_00]: slash rope factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evidently, it seems like that
population has persisted over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provides some context on things
like heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And local adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have oodles of phenotypic data
that's also linked to that accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like cannabinoids and flowering
time can all be captured and displayed via
[SPEAKER_00]: searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about phenotyping efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a schematic of how these
phenotypes are collected by different
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, will send seeds to the
collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll run an assay or a field trial
and return data to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will upload it into the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then breeders and researchers can
access that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a grant that we got with a group
led by Charlie Brummer and Daniel Papp at
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been growing the same germplasm
in these six different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at a giant swath of different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering time and sex, architecture,
collecting samples for fiber analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting seed samples for fatty acids
and proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a trial like this allows us to begin
to pull apart genotype by environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is one accession really high in this
environment, below in this environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kinds of questions are probably
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the trial that we ran this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple times a week, every plant got
phenotyped for multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been, honestly, a backbreaking
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to get an enormous amount
of data out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about 500 accessions that are
replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at all of those things I
described.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the car in the bottom corner
just for scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is before the canopy closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a jungle in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, back end of October,
there's still accessions that haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered yet, which is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab publishes this phenotyping
handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That covers in gory details.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures and equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a good bedtime read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a lot of info about these
different phenotypes that we look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to tell people how to phenotype
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to show our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are welcome to emulate that or come
up with a better plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think that it's really important to
be hyper-transparent with these resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're doing these research
efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of plant architecture,
on the right, we have three plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: one accession and three from another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just very dramatic different
morphology and architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones on the right are a fiber
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want tall, thin plants with high
apical dominance and relatively low
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left is a CBD type,
where you want more branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower apical dominance, more flower
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we best capture this kind of
data and make it available to folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the far left, we see this is
kind of our favorite accession because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so cute and weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's approximately one usun unit tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, does the sex of the plant matter
for fiber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of different theories
and thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big bottleneck is we don't have a
firm grip on what fiber quality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to make concrete statements
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are better, so forth,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can visualize all of this data here
using this kite model that was developed
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really elegant way to look at a
lot of data at once and kind of gain an
[SPEAKER_00]: overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can see, all the black lines are
an observation of an individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the colored polygon is the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at variation in flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is days from sowing to female
terminal flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quite a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't even, I chose this graph
because it was small enough to fit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a lot of big data that
we're trying to turn over, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: to support people that are working on
these kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very lucky to work with many different
chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, we've worked a lot with
Corey Brownstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of describes himself as an
ethnobotanist slash analytic chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been able to just grind through
thousands of samples and return that data
[SPEAKER_00]: to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at this and kind of gain an
idea about chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with each gentleman to kind
of go deeper and look for more obscure
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a collaboration with Roke,
who's an oil chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been looking at seed samples and
composition of these different fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can compare between these different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is data.
[SPEAKER_00]: From UC Davis in Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually kind of surprised at
the R squareds are in the 0.8 or 0.9
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the trait, so forth and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's likely fairly high
heritability to a lot of these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a great time this year working
with the Chris and Larry Smart Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been screening germplasm in our
collection for several different diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: including powdery mildew and septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you protect your fields from local
teenagers?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst pest in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we have a eight foot high fence
and security cameras that I can monitor on
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very aggressively friendly stray cat
that hangs out in there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these plots have not our
plots, but this is known to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lou and Jocelyn evaluated all of this
different germplasm in this replicated
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and had found some pretty promising
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along the x-axis are these different
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our collection, Taylor's done a lot of
work with this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see quite a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some germplasm that looks
really promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these lines may not be particularly
good cultivars, but you could use them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a back-crossing scheme to move those
alleles into your more elite lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some tool and method developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little behind schedule already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea about regenerating all of this
germplasm and maintaining purity,
[SPEAKER_00]: not allowing cross-pollination,
is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we must increase our throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying a lot of these different
designs to do regenerations in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've made several iterations of these
hemp huts that are based on special fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: with 15 micron porcelain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the hemp huts size,
which we know should be competent to
[SPEAKER_00]: exclude pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're collapsible, modular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fit them over a directly seeded
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run negative controls in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feminized or female-only populations
are grown in some of the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we crack them open if we find seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they don't work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still in testing and design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of scientists trying to
build things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it may not be the most elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think this is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal is to publish the blueprint,
make it publicly available, and help other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parts of this job is to
work with different groups, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding Insights, who's based right here,
which is a USDA-funded Cornell project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are wizards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in quantifying leaf
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gentleman, AJ, cooked up a tool
from scratch that relies on this imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: template with the colored dots,
which are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take a picture of the
same diameter and distance from each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a picture with a cell phone
that has the Fieldbook app on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which tags that image with the appropriate
metadata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can do his pipeline does some
fancy linear algebra and rotates that
[SPEAKER_00]: image and crops it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can extract out all of this
kind of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like area and width,
morphology, but also you can count every
[SPEAKER_00]: single serration on the leaf, which is
wild to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of trying to cut leaves and
put them in Ziploc bags and driving to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and image them under a hot lamp and
they're wilting, just do it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The throughput is orders of magnitude
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can even handle multiple images and
separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So incredible work.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ has even been able to kind of use this
data to pull out G by E effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different, same germplasm, different
environments and seeing kind of broader
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think pollen is going to be absolutely
essential to the long-term success of our
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distributing seeds and pollen in
parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows breeders to get a lot more
alleles quickly to make crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is also great because it can break
the temporal separation in flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when one female parent is ready,
you just pull the pollen out and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to try to coordinate that with the
male flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really hard work and to the best
of our knowledge, there's no really good
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols or standard operating procedures
on how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen viability drops very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the work that Gabi has
been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by default, by 12 hours, you have less
than 5% or so viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably could put pollen in a
freezer and hold onto it for several
[SPEAKER_00]: months and make a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we're a gene bank, we need to push
that envelope to its absolute extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're thinking, can we hold onto viable
pollen for 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of moving through this very
complicated search space of different
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters that will enable long-term
pollen storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made this contraption, which is a spore
trap connected to a backpack vacuum that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows us to hoover up oodles of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan is collecting like 10 grams of
pollen from a single plant in under a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, which is incredible to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're germinating the pollen
under BK media here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media kind of picked up on this
because we published the template and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I need to move a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Gabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question of hemp fiber quality,
is a really big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for people to get their heads
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's complicated and probably
controlled by a lot of different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with this USDA group that
has historically done a lot of the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hemp is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're trying to figure out what
tools they need they can adapt versus
[SPEAKER_00]: tools they need to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is kind of some variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the types of fiber products,
this is an image on the right that Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: made for cultivars on the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the columns are 0 to 4, 6,
and 8 weeks of rutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows the fibers to be more
readily separated from the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a genetic component to it as
well as very important agronomic and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this group that we're working with
developed all of this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made this lab grade decorticator from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can feed a single stem through
here, pulls the fiber out, measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy required to remove the fiber from
that stem, collects other data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that fiber gets pushed into all
these other types of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tensile strength, optical sensing,
color, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can look at many different traits
that we think will likely be linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: this concept of fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work a lot with my friend and colleague
Tyler Gordon who is kind of trying to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the germplasm to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's doing a lot of pre-breeding and
early selection and selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we coordinate pretty well during the
selfing process where we'll run those
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo type markers on it and he can select
out regulatory compliant materials and
[SPEAKER_00]: begin selfing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can distribute that seed from an
otherwise non-compliant accession to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, and overwhelmingly, we have this
enormous genotyping sequencing project
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've done this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in collaboration with our friends
at the Hudson Alpha Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Harkus and Phil Bence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have collected approximately four
individuals from 500 accessions for pack
[SPEAKER_00]: bio, hi-fi, low pass sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are particularly interested in sex
expression and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll figure it out, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a germplasm curator, I want to know
the population structure, the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: this giant pool of germplasm from all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that this will guide a lot
of breeding and conservation and
[SPEAKER_00]: population development efforts downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the future of germplasm
collections will be you can order seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and download genomic data or download a
genome all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really exciting and just
now becoming plausible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited about developing
different mapping populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, we've seen this slide,
but this year we've found 200,
[SPEAKER_00]: pardon me, 2,000 individuals from this
field and we've had to use molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: markers to track down males and females to
send tissue on dry ice down to Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we're working with
Breying Insight, again, to develop this
[SPEAKER_00]: public marker panel system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is, can we take advantage of
this germplasm collection to make a marker
[SPEAKER_00]: panel that's very aware of all these data
and that it needs different kinds of hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it needs to be reliable and low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the additional thing is we want
this to be community-driven, so we're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose about 3,000 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've asked many different
stakeholders, what's a snip of interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use in your group?
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of those folks have already
contributed different genetic markers that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can include in this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to make a community
resource that will benefit everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Stack is leading this effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to have him on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dunyan is the genomics coordinator at
Breeding Insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's a delight to work with and has
been giving us a lot of guidance on this
[SPEAKER_00]: process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, here's Dunyan's slide with some
really nice graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows how a breeder might take
advantage of this mid-coverage genotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a hard slide to make to cram
people on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've missed folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part of this job is the people
and working with so many brilliant and
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need a space race for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research is 50 to 70 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of resources and people
addressing different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to be a germplasm curator,
because we're in the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at a lot of these questions
through the lens of genetic diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: find the variation that occurs in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really want to thank germplasm
donors, folks from all over the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: have stewarded and maintained these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't always been an easy thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very appreciative of their
willingness to contribute some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to this public germplasm
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can leave it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions, I will try to repeat them and
also ask Geneva if they have any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, I guess, start with Geneva,
or pardon me, Ithaca, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about the impact on your
program, the ITHC cannabis is legalized or
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed, you're trying to work on it at
the federal level now, but do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that would expand your program or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hypothetical and that's one for the
policy politicians and the voters to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to speculate too much on
what that future scenario might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, again, people use this
species for many different purposes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have different sets of priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that conceivable?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't rule it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we do hold a DEA
registration, so we can, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken and egg thing where we can't
distribute it until we know it has less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 0.3% total THC, but we don't know
that till we grow it and test it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we have that protection
from, or authorization from the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of your maintaining a lot of
excessions, what does that maintenance
[SPEAKER_03]: look like in terms of how often do you
have to pull seeds out, grow them,
[SPEAKER_03]: collect more seeds just to keep it
comfortably maintained?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lay in bed and think about this a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, as hemp has been
outside of the scientific world,
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long, we don't have a lot of
longitudinal long-term studies on how long
[SPEAKER_00]: seed viability can be maintained for under
optimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that I've germinated some
seeds that were made in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discouraging fact is there's kind of
an inverse relationship between the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: content of seeds and longevity,
broadly speaking, and hemp is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: considered high oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the maximum lifespan
you can juice out of hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that we're making a lot of
efforts to scale up regenerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth chambers and greenhouses
that we have access to, we're running 24-7
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also very lucky to work
with many different collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: including some of the SUNY system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Morrisville has a large
growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kelly Henigan is working to regenerate
a lot of these materials for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a village.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other systems where we can
use small exclusion tents inside of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers to kind of multiply the number of
accessions that can be regenerated at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have mentioned that phenotyping is
really a hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you consider about using these UAVs for
collecting different data sets in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work at Cornell that are
applying UAVs to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mealyn Murdoch is kind of a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in the smart lab and has been doing
a lot of work to train different models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you remote sense for cannabinoids,
for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen some of her latest data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also work being done with
robotics, driving a robot through imaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: making 3D images of the plants,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is probably broadly true for
agricultural science that we'll see a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater amount of integration of these
kinds of high-throughput phenotyping tools
[SPEAKER_00]: like drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very excited to apply those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot to be said for good
old yardstick horticulture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there, look at a plant,
and measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Geneva questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you or anyone in your group looking
to identify herbicide tolerant traits from
[SPEAKER_00]: this genetically diverse germplasm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a great question for Lynn
Sosnowski.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't run a herbicide resistance
trial yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be something we could tag
team with Lynn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think that that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Sean says, do monaceous individuals
self-fertilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is quite possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say in every instance
that will occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of self-incompatibility work
in hemp, per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But broadly speaking, monaceous
individuals are considered possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: self-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that's all of our
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
