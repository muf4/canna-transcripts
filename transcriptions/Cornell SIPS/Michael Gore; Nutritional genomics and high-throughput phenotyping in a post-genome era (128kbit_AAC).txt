[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Jeff, for that
generous intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I can at least somewhat appease
everyone since they're here, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the greatest challenges that we
have in the 21st century, as you all know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants is trying to connect genotype to
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I think one other grand challenge
we have is trying to feed more people
[SPEAKER_00]: highly nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where my research lies is in crop
nutritional quality, high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, and analyzing quantitative
complex trait variation in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the large thrust of my presentation
will focus on these two parts right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be parts in terms of GS and
GWAS as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think of the world's
population, now we're at 7 billion people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the ones that are in the less
developed country, we're at 5.8 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about the people who
are not getting enough calories in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foods that they're eating or they aren't
eating foods, it's over 1 billion people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I draw my passion and where I
kind of drive my research right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is, you know, is the thing that
really gets me up out of bed every day
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the morning is trying to work on
this question of 2 billion malnourished
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about this, we can think
of things that are extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are these populations in the
world, be it in South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, or Sub-Saharan Africa, that are
highly deficient in things such as vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: A, iron, zinc, and iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things that are just like chronic
but very much targeted in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: subpopulations would be such as vitamin E
and B vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the traits that I focus on in my lab
are generally pro-vitamin A, iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc, vitamin E, and B vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the past almost eight years
now, my colleagues and my group have been
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out ways to improve
variation for these traits in a maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go there, I would like for
you to think about what could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: possible panacea for solving this grand
challenge that we have and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the world's nutritional value of
the food crops that they eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think of giving pre-made vitamins
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think of having the food processed
and we're artificially adding vitamins to
[SPEAKER_00]: the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also think of increasing the amount
of fruits and vegetables that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: eating, or perhaps fish and eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are part of the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I would like to focus on now
biofortification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're trying to use
variation in plant populations being genes
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to improve the quantity of these
different nutritional compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is certainly possible one could take
a transgenic approach to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can think about even in the
future after we find the causative
[SPEAKER_00]: variants such as the CRISPR approach could
also be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of maize, which I will now
focus on, we've been able to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: populations that already are present say
in the tropical and temperate parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and harnessing that variation in
plant breeding populations without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a transgenic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we think about maize,
we all love maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives our economy here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some countries such as
Zambia here in orange where over 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: their calories are coming from maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why this is a possible issue is when
we think about maize, it's a great source
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbohydrates, those calories that I
was talking of earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it lacks is a lot of the
nutritional components that these at-risk
[SPEAKER_00]: populations very much need such as vitamin
A, vitamin E, B vitamins, iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about maize is it has
tremendous natural variation for these
[SPEAKER_00]: important phenotypes for this world's
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can think about harnessing it in a
biofortification approach so what that
[SPEAKER_00]: first requires is trying to find the genes
and in a sense, at the end, the causative
[SPEAKER_00]: variants that are controlling this
variation in these plant populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the traits that we've heavily
focused on in my group is pro-vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after it's consumed say by humans,
it is then converted into what we now know
[SPEAKER_00]: as vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's at first look at the impact of
vitamin A in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think of these at-risk
populations that are not getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin A in the foods that they eat,
there are 7 million pregnant women,
[SPEAKER_00]: 127 million preschool age children are
vitamin A deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this green area right
here in such as like Zambia where as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying earlier, half of their calories are
coming from maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are at least like 20% of the
population is severe for being deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin A deficiency causes 600,000 early
childhood deaths each year and blindness
[SPEAKER_00]: in 500,000 children each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that drives us when you are a
plant breeder, you have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: create something that can be of value to
humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a sense where my passion
lies because all of this is preventable
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is something we can tackle as
plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with trying to ask any question when
it comes to plant breeding, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask the question, what is the composition
for a particular compound in the grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're looking at
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look here, the highest
proportion are zeaxanthin and lutein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are obviously very important for the
health of the eye, but they have no
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-vitamin A activity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the compounds here, there are
basically three which have pro-vitamin A
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, but my favorite and the one that
has highest pro-vitamin A activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend beta-carotene right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see here, it's only 6% of the
total of the carotenoids found in grain of
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's think about it in terms of the
continuous variation in a population for
[SPEAKER_00]: this compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on average in a population of temperate
and tropical lines that is capturing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the variation in the public breeding
pool, on average 1.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put that into context, Harvest Plus
has a target of 10-fold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on average, we need to increase
beta-carotene by 10-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here though, at the tail,
it's only 7.5, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you should then be asking yourself
as plant breeders is, is there superior
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles that we can recombine in these
like say tropical lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical maize germplasm populations that
we can increase pro-vitamin A to or even
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than this target that's been set
by Harvest Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a challenge that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other trait we've been working on
in my lab is vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something that needs to be
clearly defined here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't really extreme deficient
populations in the world for vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are populations in various countries
that are not getting enough vitamin E in
[SPEAKER_00]: the foods that they eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: here, there are 26 or 40% of people that
had plasma tocopherol at a concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: that was actually lead to an increase of
cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 26 to 41% in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about it now in terms
across the world, there hasn't been a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work on vitamin E as there has been on
vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really have a good handle on
what are the at-risk populations across
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what has been reported,
we see that there are some countries such
[SPEAKER_00]: as Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what this country is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunisia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunisia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, Elodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the French are very well trained
on their geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can ask the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, alpha tocopherol has the
highest vitamin E activity in grain of
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we see here, only 11% of all of the
toco-chrominols, i.e., vitamin E
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, are comprising what you would
actually find in grain of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when we look at the continuous
variation as we did with the pro-vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: A, here we have an average of 8.19.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can do some calculations based on
eating 400 grams per day on what someone
[SPEAKER_00]: would require, on average you're talking
about breeding like four to maybe fivefold
[SPEAKER_00]: higher on average in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that actually seems
to be more tractable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're the catch that I will show in
a few upcoming slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the challenge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find what these causative genes
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also want to find what are the
superior alleles controlling this
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's favorite hammer,
the maize NAM population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it has been genotype with HapMap
version one and version two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had two outgrowths of this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can include all the checks and
controls, we are pushing close to 20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLC runs on this seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which as you would imagine, required
chaining four post-docs to four HPLCs for
[SPEAKER_00]: two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they weren't chained,
but that's just to kind of give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the positive here, if there is one,
we can actually phenotype carotenoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: tocochrominols at the same time from the
same grain sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing of value is here,
so we have the HapMap version one and two,
[SPEAKER_00]: the HPLC data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done RNA-seq on six time points
on grain after it has been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think about over these six time
points of the 25 founder lines of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that then gives us the chance
to really do here is ask the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense what genes are turned on and
off over the phase of kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it allows us to ask the question
for the QTLs that we find, which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually eQTL and when these eQTL are
actually turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously I can show hundreds of
these plots, but I will just be showing
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what we, in a sense, our finding
is for our favorite pro-vitamin A
[SPEAKER_00]: compound, paedocartene, for this one that
has the highest pro-vitamin A activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are only seven QTL that are
controlling that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you should be thinking as breeders,
this is something then that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: tractable because when you think something
as complex in yield, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds to perhaps thousands of genes
controlling that variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this, in terms of like the
composition trait in the grain itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are only finding seven QTLs in this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would also like to offer that there
are most likely rare variants out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that haven't been captured in this
population that could be contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: variation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about it as a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of these QTL, we found five kits that
are in very well-defined candidate genes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the carotenoid pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us a pretty good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these five QTLs, which had what we
will refer to as a prior genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: had very large effects as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these two that are unresolved,
had effect sizes in terms of across the
[SPEAKER_00]: population that were actually very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we're able to define and
determine what these causative genes
[SPEAKER_00]: actually are for the key QTL controlling
this trait in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the RNA-seq data can
become very valuable because then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: begin putting all the QTLs on a time axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we are seeing here,
these are the effect estimates for the QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the log transform FPKM value
for the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of just kind of view it
like copies for the gene in each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: founder lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're seeing here for this one
gene, this CRIT-RB1, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here, is converting
beta-carotene to beta-cryptozanthin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has only half of the pro-vitamin A
activity as this compound here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very much an E-QTL,
and it's constant over the whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, phase of the kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, it's turned on at 12 days after
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, 20 days after pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing here that's very valuable is
so we're testing the effect sizes or the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects themselves of the QTL with the
gene activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we're able to then say that
this is, in fact, an E-QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since five of those seven QTL were
controlling variation and from a pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: we now have the opportunity to really
design a pathway breeding approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: improving pro-vitamin A in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, in this case, we had these two
genes right here, which you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: view them as you want them turned on very
highly because they are generating the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a PSY1 gene right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first enzyme going into the
carotenoid pathway, and you want this gene
[SPEAKER_00]: to be turned on very high as well because
you want to take all the flux from here
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it going down into the carotenoid
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we have an allele of this
epsilon gene right here that is weak,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the activity of this gene will be
low, and then the flux will then shift
[SPEAKER_00]: over to this branch point over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that is important because this is
a side with beta-carotene, which has the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest pro-vitamin A activity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to have a break in our
pathway, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the CRIT RB1 comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a weak allele of this gene
here, that means less beta-carotene will
[SPEAKER_00]: be converted to this compound,
which has only half of the pro-vitamin A
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when we think about breeding for
high pro-vitamin A content, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: very much a combinatorial breeding
approach when you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: recombine the most optimal variation at
each of the genes to get the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of pro-vitamin A in May's grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say in the past five to six
years, these two genes here, have been
[SPEAKER_00]: used to release high pro-vitamin A hybrids
to the country of Zambia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, having worked with very much
closely with Harvest Plus, with my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, now there are over 10,000
farmers in Zambia that are growing this
[SPEAKER_00]: orange high pro-vitamin May's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one thing that's obviously very
valuable when you're being in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding department is obviously you want
to do cutting edge science, but we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce what we are doing to practice to
have an impact on the people that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the key points here is
that if we just created something,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's kind of like a foreign
concept of high pro-vitamin A orange May's
[SPEAKER_00]: and brought it to a country like Zambia,
they probably wouldn't eat it because say
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past 100 years, they have been
eating grain that is white from May's and
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense has no pro-vitamin A at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a strong cultural
preference to eat the grain that is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of outreach and education from
groups like Harvest Plus, they actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the towns and they educate the end
user that eating this May's will save the
[SPEAKER_00]: eyesight of your children and perhaps also
their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't bring the public in
from the very beginning, we cannot expect
[SPEAKER_00]: that they will use something that we have
created over the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now Christine in my lab has been
carrying out some work where we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to ask the question, okay,
we've been breathing for high pro-vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when this pathway which we
have now characterized very well is being
[SPEAKER_00]: perturbed by heat and drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some of the things that she's
been carrying out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm pretty sure the seeds have been
planted, the plants are germinating and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are growing and we have everything in
place that we will be receiving ship grain
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in this coming year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will run HPLC on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, you know, the thing we have to
ask ourselves with climate change as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've been testing all these high
pro-vitamin A lines under well-irrigated,
[SPEAKER_00]: happy places, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put them out in places where
they have to undergo heat and drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very much going to be a reality
that the plants and the people will face
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I showed earlier was a very
tractable trait in the sense we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find what the causative gene was for
those five QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for alpha-tocopherol, which has the
highest vitamin E activity, this is a case
[SPEAKER_00]: where 13 QTL are controlled phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look to see what the candidate
genes are, we only can figure out two of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would also like to point out
is this VTE4 gene, it's able to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: half of the phenotypic variation that we
see in this population, whereas these,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one, this one candidate gene here,
and all of the ones that we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize, their percent variation,
accounting for the phenotype, is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: 2% or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now really tried, hardly,
to like tease apart these QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about plants, they like to keep
things like this very tightly to the vest,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that are very
challenging to tease apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of these, we have, I would say,
five very good candidates that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to tease apart, and it seems
like transport is actually fairly key in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell and for this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in contrast to the CRIT-RB1
approach, whereas here, 12 days after
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, we don't really see any trend
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, the activity that,
and the gene being turned on, isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking with the effects of the QTL at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 20 days after pollination do you
really see that enzyme begin to convert
[SPEAKER_00]: gamma-tocopherol to the compound that has
the highest vitamin E activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, as I was saying earlier,
we can then begin to have an idea of when
[SPEAKER_00]: these QTL are turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can then have hypothesis that
can be tested, where then perhaps we can
[SPEAKER_00]: find a QTL that is turned on 12 days after
pollination, and then we can ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, is that gonna lead to higher
content in the grain itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that we are asking
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after now carrying this forward,
our grant was just funded, so here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: been previously working on pro-vitamin A,
vitamin E, now we're beginning to tackle B
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins and zinc and iron, and this is by
D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wu in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, we're beginning to
analyze B1, B2, B3, and B6 in the grain of
[SPEAKER_00]: maize, and in the 281 panel, we're finding
quite a bit of variation, so we think when
[SPEAKER_00]: we go to a panel of, say, over 2,000
lines, we'll be able to find greater
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these blue ones right here,
these are the lines that we are employing
[SPEAKER_00]: in crosses now, because we're trying to
ask the question, why is this like an
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme phenotypic outlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a QTL that's, you know, how does it
actually work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're trying to figure out
now, and this is a GWAS that was run just
[SPEAKER_00]: this past few weeks in the Maize Ames
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wu, I'm happy to say you have some hits
here that look very, very promising that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be able to follow up for a trade of
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why this trade is very important,
iron deficiency impacts over two billion
[SPEAKER_00]: people worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like one of the most important
traits that we could be breeding for in
[SPEAKER_00]: maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this information now that we
are generating in pro-vitamin A,
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids, vitamin E, tocochrominols,
B vitamins, zinc and iron, are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: now being able to feed into my own
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're doing this program,
because the third most important vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is in tomato, is in potato, it's sweet
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I was surprised as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you believe people eat over 20
pounds of it per year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consider myself one of those
people, but hey, there's some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be eating quite a bit of corn,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that we have been doing for
the past two years is growing a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: panel out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since these traits, we have to
phenotype on fresh kernels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, so this is a little more challenging
than what we had been doing in a sense in
[SPEAKER_00]: like field corn maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to harvest it fresh, and then the
ears themselves are in a sense kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're ground up frozen,
and then we run HPLC on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Matt, for doing all this hard
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this is actually beginning to
turn into some real GWAS hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend right here on chromosome
five, which is that key enzyme that
[SPEAKER_00]: converts gamma tocopherol to the compound
that has the highest vitamin E activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we hit that same key gene in this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question was, the question we have
now, though, is the most favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: variants already in this panel,
or do we have to begin crossing between
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm pools?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the real challenge,
and we hope not, but if we have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are also doing GS for this breeding
program, and there were 100 crosses this
[SPEAKER_00]: past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are now doing GS, and this,
if you will, this is like pro-vitamin A,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the combo of these three
compounds that have the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-vitamin A activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two compounds here, if you
recall, are the ones that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: critical for eye health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just for one HPLC run,
and so we think this will improve over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here for this trait, it's at .6,
and here for these two traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have high pro-vitamin A activity,
we're close to .2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of the challenge with this is
this panel has been genotyped with GBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as we've seen in our prior work,
we need to closely tag the causative
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, if you will, in the panel,
and there are some genes we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: tagging very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, sorry, Matt, we're going to have
to do some targeted PCR to actually pull
[SPEAKER_00]: those out, possibly, or we can just do
whole genomes and call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have you choose which one you want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one critical question that I had back
in 2009, after we were generating all
[SPEAKER_00]: these HapMaps, were, what about the
phenyl?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I began working on
field-based high-tipid phenotyping in my
[SPEAKER_00]: prior job on cotton, because even though
we think with GS we're going to have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot less field phenotyping, we have to
do it for the training set, and we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it repeatedly over time to update the
training models as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my prior work, we created this
high-clearance high-tipid phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor here, and everything is run on
GPS, so we can figure out where the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: trait is coming from in a plot,
and our field map is on a GPS coordinates
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, and we're able to look at
vegetation, variation from canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance, canopy temperature,
and canopy height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a great thing with this tractor was we
were able to do it over the whole growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season, and I didn't have to be out there
like 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the afternoon when it was 120 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had someone driving a tractor
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know, our revamped tractor,
I'll just call it now, has a cab with AC
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, so although this looks very
draconian, if you will, someone's having
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive this tractor through the field,
things have been revised and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: improved now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, it's all on GPS and
everything, so the person in the tractor
[SPEAKER_00]: cab doesn't even have to touch the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He or she just sits in there, and it just
drives by itself, and they're in AC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for all I know, they could be having
some film fest in there or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't have to see where you're
driving at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where you have a tractor
cab, a question that you're asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tool isn't created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the question in terms of how much
variation is there for, say, canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, and can I quantify that over
time, over the whole growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can I find QTL that is actually
controlling that variation at each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key time points over the growth phase of
cotton?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we had a recombinant inbred line
population, so this is very humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went into cotton, there were no
very large populations, so I had to use
[SPEAKER_00]: what was basically created for me at
first, and then here we had the high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping tractor,
and then we had a cotton picker driving
[SPEAKER_00]: through to do traits such as, like,
yield, fiber quality traits, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: plant phase traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Tim Setter here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to give a shout-out to him for
thank you for doing this plant assay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll highlight that result soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our actual test here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we had dry rep one, which is
basically our drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here is our control treated as
wet, then dry rep two, and wet rep two
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing is all growing on
drip, and it hardly ever rains in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I will say, if you do plan a
drought test, it increases the probability
[SPEAKER_00]: of rain, I have seen, even in a place like
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one other key point is we had
to characterize the variation for the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, such as, like, clay and sand
content, because whenever you're doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: drought testing, the soil will have more
variation than your actual plant
[SPEAKER_00]: population for the phenotype that you are
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of give you an idea of
where we are here, so here we were at
[SPEAKER_00]: place one, planting right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until first flower, everything was
treated the same in terms of the drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at flowering is where we began
imposing the droughts treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in traits that we were also doing were
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a vegetation indice here and
canopy height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 a.m., 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, you're trying to capture
the variation over the whole growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season here, as we're doing this every
week, but also capturing the variation at
[SPEAKER_00]: each time point within each of those
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the three growth phases that we
were targeting were at flowering and as
[SPEAKER_00]: post flower and as we have the growing
fiber as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, yield and the fiber
quality traits that were collected as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was just published this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the fascinating things with
this work is prior to this, there really
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't a way to quantify a trait like
canopy temperature in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be all by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But traits like this can actually change
with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you could think you would maybe
have to have an army of people to do like
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 and some plots just for a trait as
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this case, the tractor could phenotype
all of the plots in a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have each of the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 2010, 2011, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the treatment wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the dry drought
treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's red, then we have a QTL in a
sense that's increasing the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's blue, we have a QTL that's
decreasing the canopy temperature then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if Tim was here, he would be so excited
that sizeic acid actually hit one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: key canopy temperature QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually showing up pretty
early on in the growth phase of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and is carrying forward towards harvest as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that is important because this is
a plant hormone that is in a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we also have a QTL that is going
right here, it's a possible candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you're trying to find candidate
genes, you should always have the caveat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always find a candidate gene,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one actually you can tie in with
the biopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual compound itself maps to the
same place as that canopy temperature QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also wanted to ask the
question, can we use this to also track
[SPEAKER_00]: with yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out is the plants that
take, in a sense, take a great risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say this because these are the
ones that plan to use a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And continue to cool their canopy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the plants that will be trying
to conserve the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they won't cool their canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the plants that are grown here,
if you recall, everything is grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: drip in a hot, arid world.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the ones that are going to
continue to transpire at a high rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to continue to fix carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're going to continue to fix
carbon, they are going to have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are perhaps growing in a dry
land part of the world, you would perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: want a genotype that will conserve water
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then will, in a sense, use more
towards the end of the growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as like grain fill or fill,
in this case, for full fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we also figured out was that
canopy temperature at flowering was most
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive of yield at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that was, it's clear
now to us that if there's high heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think is going to happen to
that pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen isn't going to be very viable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of like what is happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a high heat event at
flowering, it'll have a great impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen will be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you won't have any seed,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton fiber.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now wanted to ask the question,
after cotton has been defoliated,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense, you add a chemical and it
drops all of the beautiful green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then drive a combine through it
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, in a sense, creating a cloud
point map of all of the cotton plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a sense, what this is is you take
something that's like bright laser,
[SPEAKER_00]: you shine it at a plant, it comes back
time of flight, and then as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: returning, you calculate the time,
and then you can recreate like a 3D map of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since this is the defoliated cotton,
what I really wanted to do with this was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually try to count yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Count the cotton balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a case where we have one plot
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since this cotton has been
defoliated, you can see this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the cotton balls right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this piece of equipment was kind of put
on the tractor, and here the tractor is
[SPEAKER_00]: driving through the field and we're
recreating the geometry of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can pull out one plant and
then use a Euclidean clustering approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're using that to count the
cotton balls on the plant, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense, yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are actually cotton breeders
that grow out hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plots, and they don't want to combine all
of those all at once, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to target just those F2s or
F4 plants out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be valuable for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that was with cotton and now with
this maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of had the question,
how do we do plant pathology in a corn
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all by eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all with human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm out in the field, I guarantee you,
I probably won't be accurate like Tier if
[SPEAKER_00]: he's out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we move that subjectivity from
plant phenotyping?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're wondering, this is the one
that's the corn blight, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we find the actual blight out in
the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where artificial intelligence
actually comes into play, and then tying
[SPEAKER_00]: it with drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we should now kind of view drones
as almost our colleagues and our
[SPEAKER_00]: coworkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when, yes, it sounds a little
frightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have this drone flying through
a corn field, can you have it so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a photo, and then it's analyzing
that photo, telling you if a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen is on that corn leaf,
and then tell the actual grower where he
[SPEAKER_00]: or she should go to the field to either
apply a chemical or actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chop the plant down or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here is an actual drone
photo of a corn field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be a beautiful corn lesion
right there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the challenge is, I can easily find
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we train the AI to go through
thousands and thousands of photos that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been taken over the course of the
year to then find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the most you know,
painful things is training this AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to have actual,
a true and a fact plant pathologist that's
[SPEAKER_00]: telling yes, no, yes, no, yes,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So training it, I think is, I think almost
like the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may have to train on thousands of
actual photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to kind of get an idea of how this
works, probably the easiest way I can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you is it's in a sense converting pixels
into words, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes versus no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after the AI has been trained,
we can then take a photo from the field
[SPEAKER_00]: that, thanks to tier that he took,
and then we can apply the AI to that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, if it's black,
that means probability of zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's very bright white, probability of
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's finding all of them
on the leaves right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's finding even some right here
on that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably one of the real challenges is
training this AI is when you're out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, you also have a lot of soil and
other plant parts and fragments,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, covering the ground and also
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can also ask the question,
in the case where we don't see any,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you find any?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how well are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing pretty well,
but we can always be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm kind of happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20th century was all about chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 21st is all going to be about
robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when we think about plant
breeding, what we should be thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and this is my colleague Josh,
where you can then be creating these
[SPEAKER_00]: autonomous field robots that can do
phenotyping that are going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields, doing such races like canopy
temperature, canopy reflectance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and canopy geometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that can begin, I'll actually
really ask the question, is what QTLs are
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on over the entire growing season?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you think about calculating
biomass yield, if the robot's driving
[SPEAKER_00]: through the field every day, you can then
think about biomass yield every single day
[SPEAKER_00]: over the whole growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can perhaps begin to really
think apart, you know, like tease apart G
[SPEAKER_00]: by E questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I think this field is actually
heading is, so we have the AI,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have that thing that we call the
breeder's eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use it to train low-cost field
robots to actually begin to help select
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this concept here, we have this very
low-cost robot with these thin carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can walk through the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say we had a breeder that may walk
through like 4,000 plots, and that breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: is, in a sense, choosing plants based on
their height and plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that breeder can then train the AI,
you can then turn out these low-cost
[SPEAKER_00]: robots just to kind of like walk through
the field, and then they can choose the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the breeder isn't happy with the
plants that were chosen, they can retrain
[SPEAKER_00]: the AI each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a concept now, but this is
where I see the field in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where I'm kind of trying to
like drag the field of plant breeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: this side aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that, there are a lot of
colleagues to thank for this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be able to thank them all because
I'm out of time because we had to compute
[SPEAKER_00]: our problems at first, but with that,
I'll thank you for your time.
Yes, Lee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question that Lee asked,
did we find the most superior PSY1 gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say at this point in time,
no, but there are at least two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have seen, but I don't know if we
found the one that is like the key one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why we're hoping with like the
Ames panel that we may actually find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we weren't happy with it,
then we'll just create our own in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it actually hasn't, because like the
part of the seed where those genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on, it hasn't had an impact on it
at all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of have seen some things that
have been published, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they've, you know, some of it's been in
like greenhouses and growth chambers and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this has been kind of the key
part, actually taking it out to the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there are some things that we
think that we should see, and we'll see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually see them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's phase two, but yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about tocochrominols,
it can enhance the longevity of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's what you're basically
saying, right?
Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sorghum.
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Yeah.
Susan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we also see that same
problem in the high, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is there is like an E
and a G by E and a G component to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G component, I think we can kind
of get a handle of, but then there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: a large E component that I think is more
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's also known G by G because in
indica rice, it holds less well than in
[SPEAKER_01]: japonica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in the tropics where they grow
indica that they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need it in the temperate where
they grow the japonica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's clearly a G by G component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we need to do a little more
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask if there's any questions
from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is someone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions from Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's thank him again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
