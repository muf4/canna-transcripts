[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the wonderful things about working
at Cornell University is the people you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a number of outstanding
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is Dr. Chris Peters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's his work that I'm going to be
presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the approach that we've taken in this
work is a modeling study or a whole series
[SPEAKER_00]: of modeling studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work started at Cornell University and
was funded by USDA and later the Kellogg
[SPEAKER_00]: Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking over a whole series of
studies, what we wanted to do was
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how many persons could be fed a
complete, balanced diet on land currently
[SPEAKER_00]: in use to grow food crops with sustainable
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much land is needed to feed one
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research and modeling team involved
Dr. Chris Peters, who's now at Tufts
[SPEAKER_00]: University in the School of Nutrition
Science and Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of his graduate students have
contributed to the latter part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Jennifer Wilkins was formerly at
Cornell in Food Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now think she's in an endowed chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, she's at Public Health
and Food Studies and Nutrition at Syracuse
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Art Limbo is now at Selisbury
University in the Science and Technology
[SPEAKER_00]: Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped us with a lot of the interface
with mapping and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nelson Bills was in AEM, has retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm now retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of moved away from Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background, the first, just notice
that Chris Peters is the senior author in
[SPEAKER_00]: all the papers I put up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the complete list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing, they started
publication in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of this funding grant request,
the last paper came out a year and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studies I'm going to look at today
are, first of all, looking at the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State model, where we looked at the diet,
what we call the food prints and food
[SPEAKER_00]: sheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll define those a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the population that could be fed in
New York State with our agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That study was funded by USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kellogg Foundation became interested in
the work, what we were doing, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: funded us to compare New York State with
Michigan, New Mexico, and Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to look at all 48 states,
they picked out these four additional,
[SPEAKER_00]: or three additional states because Kellogg
Foundation is interested in childhood
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition or malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michigan, a major study is going on in
Detroit for inner city kids, in New Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Indian reservations, and in
Mississippi, rural poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we'll give you money to
study all 48 adjacent states if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: these three next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some interesting studies
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went on to look at all 48
states to compare balanced diets relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the populations that could be
supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much food does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: The information for most of this work is
in published sources and with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you weight the average size of an
American, all sizes of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: all ages, all genders, all physiological
states, according to the distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes 2,153 calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or kilocalories per person to balance the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually went back to the 1992 USDA
food pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plate looks a whole lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't show you this important
information of how many servings you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get into the footnotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you how many cups of various
kinds of food or what weight of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually could start here and work
back to agricultural production with the
[SPEAKER_00]: information provided in the pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we put into the models, finally,
the last one was 186 primary food
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are essentially crops in the USDA
database about crop production in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more foods in that,
but those are the primary commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn shows up in 30% of the food in the
supermarket right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some assumptions and
manipulations going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going back from these food
commodities to agricultural commodities or
[SPEAKER_00]: actually crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the USDA and other services have
also told us what's the loss from the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets out of the field through storage,
processing, cooking, all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the total loss?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's information available for
each one of those kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up then with the weight of
food that's consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing about this
study, particularly when we started back
[SPEAKER_00]: in just after 2000, is we're linking
agriculture and crop production to human
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition in a pretty sophisticated way
using the data that is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not listed the crops,
but they're categorized, all the grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the vegetables, the fruits,
the dairy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other protein crops, beans, lentils,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added fats and sweeteners are the
categories in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the statements that Chris made
in the last paper I showed up there is
[SPEAKER_00]: that land, I almost wanted to say soil,
is the foundational resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could argue that water is going to be
a limiting factor or that climate is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a limiting factor, but we focused
on the land factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you define sustainable land
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, you know, I didn't come up with
this except when we were in our earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions, I said, let's go back to the
land use capability classes from NRCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we'll define what is
sustainable use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eight classes of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class one land has only slight limitations
to crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class two land has only moderate
limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class three, they say they're severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening is you go down here
to one through skip five, one through
[SPEAKER_00]: four, and then six and seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the slope is increasing,
so the land becomes more erosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there could be other limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you get out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class five has a set of limitations that
are not easily corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too shallow, too rocky, too wet,
too steep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing season is too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an aside, I was crossing when I was a
graduate student traveling from Nebraska
[SPEAKER_00]: to Davis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped the gas up in the Great Basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountains all around with lots of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, why is this in sagebrush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't it in irrigated agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy said, we get a frost 12 months
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful looking land, plenty of water
around for irrigation, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in class five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow crops there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you get down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the management modifications on
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you get to class two land and you
use conservation tillage, you can crop it
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, even though it has some slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can crop it only three out of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years in the crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two years, it needs to be in a
sod crop, essentially a pasture,
[SPEAKER_00]: something you could graze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need to graze it,
but it needs to be in the sod to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use conservation tillage on
class three land or put a sod on it three
[SPEAKER_00]: out of five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just use it, a sod two out of
the five years with conservation tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're reading my code.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to class four land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only can crop it once in every five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get down here, class six land is only
grazing and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model data, we started out in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show you this rather than
going through those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map of land use in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really interested in the
agricultural use of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pulls out like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State looks kind of funny here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The border of the state is actually down
here and they've extended the border to
[SPEAKER_00]: the American border next to Canada out
into the lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, that's where the agricultural
land is in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Western New York where there is a
concentration of that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plugged in the dietary information,
the land data, and we then did the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people could you feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diets we looked at ran from this many
calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting, I'm not going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had percent calories from fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That influences how many people you can
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here is the population you can
feed with just the agricultural land in
[SPEAKER_00]: use, currently in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's current night, 2010, with different
diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: With from zero ounces to six ounces of
meat in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really interesting thing about
this, the surprise, is that the vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: diet, no meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase the fat, you feed fewer
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing fat takes more land,
more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's photosynthetically not as efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get right down to the physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you look at these numbers on
a vegetarian diet versus these with two
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces of meat in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually feed more people with a
little bit of meat using the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State land base than you can on a
vegetarian diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a surprise to a lot of
ecologists, and we had to explain what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is that because of the nature of
the land in New York State, you have all
[SPEAKER_00]: this unused land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get back here to the zero
ounces or grams, a different scale right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changed it on my slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you've got a lot of unused
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're feeding fewer people because
you've got land you cannot use in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too steep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you increase the quantity of meat
in the diet, you use more and more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: land with those perennial crops,
grazing beef cattle, sheep, dairy cattle
[SPEAKER_00]: on the steeper hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many people can we feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at, this is the 30%
calorie that's in the middle of the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the extremes I was talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can feed almost 30% of the population
of New York State in 2010 in a vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you in acres a little bit later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see, this is the unused land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the land that you're using decreases as
you go from six ounces of meat back to
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six ounces is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the summary and the extension
publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for crediting me with some
extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about what's your carbon
footprint?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your land footprint in terms of
food production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the six ounce diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 1.9 acres per person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know the metric units there in
the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero grams of meat in the diet takes half
an acre per person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fed the most people with the two
ounces of meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's equal to about the size of a
deck of playing cards per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more than one egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one with all that meat,
that's three quarter pounders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see, there's a huge impact on how
much land it takes based on your diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very interesting work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we were able to do because
of the way the maps were coded for New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State, we could see where the food
had to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed the concept of the food
shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the area around major
cities in New York that would feed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in that population center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the people in the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that for most of the
cities in New York State, we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: what amounts to a local food system that
is potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing only with foods produced in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means, there's no oranges and no
bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get your vitamin C from
sauerkraut or something else or other
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed an optimization procedure
to go with the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he minimized the distance that food had
to travel to feed everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd come up with this interesting
kind of map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see, here's the population
back I've estimated I think 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Buffalo and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the percent of the food needs
you can meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse,
you can virtually feed all the people with
[SPEAKER_00]: that local food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the distance that the food has
to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average across the whole state,
including New York and Poughkeepsie,
[SPEAKER_00]: is just 30 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put New York City in there,
the whole thing blows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really feed New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the local food sheds look like
are not very local anymore because New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City, to minimize the miles,
is robbing from the other city,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of local food sheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could feed about a third of the people
in New York State with the land that is in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always going to have to import food
into New York State with our present
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we did was to compare the
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I just showed you for New York
State, we can feed about one third of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing the best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cows will actually increase the
food supply because it allows us to use
[SPEAKER_00]: land in a sustainable way that we
otherwise could not.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to Michigan, lots of
agricultural land, no problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing interesting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just feed themselves about
anything we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to New Mexico, big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got all this wasteland,
all this rangeland, Class 5 land in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every cow in the state reduced the
food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cows have to be fed in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winter feed for cows comes from
irrigated land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigated alfalfa for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every acre of irrigated alfalfa reduces
other food crops that could have been on
[SPEAKER_00]: that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this land configuration,
every cow in the state actually decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of food they were producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the cowboys out there
would like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the cows compete for the land,
you've got some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's go back to or continue with
our study of the 48 contiguous states,
[SPEAKER_00]: adjacent states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this human dietary need,
complete, balanced diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you those numbers before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not involved in the study,
but Chris and his graduate students
[SPEAKER_00]: actually developed a more sophisticated
model than we had in the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding livestock, a good livestock feed
need model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were still a hundred and eighty-six
different foods and feeds, but the loss is
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land types and the areas now in
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all potential, no changes in
population or land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted this sustainable cropping
system, sustainable land use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that looks like now is what
I've showed you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight classes, we're saying this is
our definition of sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these conservation tillage or
crop rotations, and then out here looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the whole United States and subtracting
the land used to grow cotton, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with 95 million hectares in
food production in classes one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of class two may be in forage crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, all of it could be if you're
dedicated to cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have 39 million hectares that we
call grazed cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in classes three and four where you
need to have cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to graze them, but they're
there and you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so called that grazed cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow some crops some of the time on
these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get down here and from five
to seven, really, we have 299 million
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares in permanent grazing land in the
United States that are as best we could
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out being used to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get that again, this is really
important looking at sustainable land use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 95 million hectares of cultivated
crop land.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're using conservation tillage,
oops, we're using conservation tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all of class two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, some of class two will be down
here in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 39 million hectares of grazed
cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is land we can grow crops on some of
the time, but not all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here, classes five and six,
299 million hectares of what amounts to
[SPEAKER_00]: rangeland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have put in some picture slides,
but to show you what rangeland in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you get close to the Adirondack
Mountains, you get shallow soils to
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone bedrock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't usually talk about range in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of the Western range and
doesn't look any different, doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any different.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the calculations that they did in
the animal model is what is the production
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of all this land?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average, based on how much meat
they're producing, they didn't go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the yield with something less than
700 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across that land, but you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it to grow beef or lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we wanted to do in this study of
the 48 adjacent states was to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go over this several times,
but this is the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the baseline diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the current way we're eating right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA has the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a positive control,
the POS diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, we get rid of the excesses in the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're over consuming calories and we
create a balanced diet, formulating a
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced diet that has the right amount of
calories in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make further changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an omnivorous diet that's 100%
healthy, down to 20% healthy, omnivorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look at oval lacto-vegetarian with
eggs and milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lacto-vegetarian with milk and the vegan
diet with no animal products at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make those comparisons of how many
people could we feed on those acres in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually looks at the 10 diets in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the average person in the
United States is concerning 2844
[SPEAKER_00]: kilocalories per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the animal protein and the
vegetable protein and the calculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many acres it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed that person that diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you drop it down to the 2153,
which was calculated an adequate diet and
[SPEAKER_00]: only changes in the fat in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still an excessive protein diet
according to nutritional standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we go from the positive
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just stop over eating calories to
the balanced omnivorous diet, which now
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein level to what the
recommendations say we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just add more, well,
we start adding vegetarian components to
[SPEAKER_00]: the diet as we increase the omnivorous
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, the acres per person
for these diets, minimizing acres to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: one person is your definition of what is
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegan diet is the most sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people think, no, no,
that's the obvious answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the populations we actually can
feed with those different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the percent of the US crop
land that is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, the vegan diet feeds fewer
people than the lacto-vegetarian diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the best one in terms of feeding
number of people because it's using less
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land sustainability kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to have animals in
your system, what are you going to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: those forages?
[SPEAKER_00]: You plow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that'll increase the yields,
which was not calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, this diet, the
lacto-vegetarian, this is 261% of the 2010
[SPEAKER_00]: population of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population in the United States right now,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 325, 326 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the diets, we have a land base
in the United States that provides more
[SPEAKER_00]: food than we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's part of the reason why we're
overeating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a food industry that advertises
eat more, eat more because we've got it to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the only factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, these are the numbers of
people that we can feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land area required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it takes the least land area
for the vegan diet, but it doesn't feed as
[SPEAKER_00]: many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we using that crop land?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 95 million hectares of crop land
that we could crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this baseline diet, we're only
using 71 million hectares of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the baseline diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have so much livestock,
and we're producing livestock feed and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the perennial crop land,
the unused crop land, this is all the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: land, land where we can cultivate,
that we can plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using all of it in these diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we get down here, because of the
conservation requirement on the class III
[SPEAKER_00]: and IV land, less and less can be used as
we're providing more and more vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: products into the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also see in that 299 million
acres of rangeland or grazing land,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get down here just 40% of the
100% omnivorous diet, the fraction of that
[SPEAKER_00]: land we're using starts dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get down here to the vegetarian
diets and the vegan diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using any of the rangeland in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've put these numbers in red because
the question comes up, and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: validity of this somewhat theoretical,
we're using published data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are all the assumptions what they
should be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we could use this unused crop land
for different crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: That maybe is a clue to how to increase
the food supply in developing new crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a modeler, let's just change the
numbers with sensitivity analysis and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to grow food crops on the
unused perennial crop land?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be classes III and IV for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, more tea crops, more nuts,
more apples, and so forth in our diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we could put on fairly steep
land, whatever they would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this affect the rankings?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the analysis, there's a sensitivity
analysis, and you can look at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the vegan diet became equal to
the oval lacto and the lacto-vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: diet if we could put 92% of that class III
and IV land into crops every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the baseline NRCS is only 71%
is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is needed to move that way is to
have crops that we can put on that
[SPEAKER_00]: marginal steep land that produce food in a
perennial way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move toward getting perennial cereal crops
and so forth might help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, research is going on in
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concluding comments, got a lot of time
to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the diet has a big influence
in how many people that we can feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is known, but this is giving
quantitative information on that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetarian and vegan diets do take the
least amount of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're concerned about carbon
sequestration in wild land, if wild places
[SPEAKER_00]: for wild animals to live and so forth,
a vegan diet is good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sustainable use of land now in
production will provide feed for livestock
[SPEAKER_00]: that will produce meat and milk in the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, more people can be fed with
modest amounts of animal products in the
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at that study in New Mexico,
I think that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Livestock can compete with food crops for
the use of cropland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will reduce the food supply
where that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a land resource such as we
have in New York State or Michigan,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look in detail, but we have
enough marginal, steep land that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed our livestock adjusting what their
ration is, then animals are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local food sheds, oops, come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local food sheds, this is recent
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed you New York City blows the
thing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been saying for years as I talk
about this, I don't have any idea how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna feed New York City,
how we're gonna feed Los Angeles and Tokyo
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about a local food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban agricultural make a significant
contribution, but they're still gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: to import food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris and his graduate students have
looked at other cities on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're only halfway surrounded by
agricultural land or worse than that by
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains and rocks like New York City,
a local food system is not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to continue to import
food into those big coastal cities or get
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know if you wanna think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitivity analysis shows that the
use of the cropland pasture changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: results on the ranking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're assuming what is sustainable land
use so that we've got 39 million hectares
[SPEAKER_00]: of cropland in the United States to 48
states that have to have a lot of forages
[SPEAKER_00]: on them for sustainable use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that could change, that would change
the comparison of the different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vegan diet would become more
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be careful how I say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some proponents of the vegan diet are
very suspicious about the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they were almost livid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done any work that has brought
so much response from the public as this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular work because people advocating
vegan diets just were sure that it would
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't like the idea that that
was not the most sustainable method you
[SPEAKER_00]: could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you wanna define
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the vegan diet used the least
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had a lot of unused land that
affected the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I wanna stop and I've
given myself too much time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you get the idea of what we
have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to have Chris Peters here as
my graduate student and then postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his work I think has set up his whole
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting grants, publishing lots of
papers, continuing to work on the modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: of food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's gotten tenure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
