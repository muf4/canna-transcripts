[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to be talking about the
chemical language of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indeed, as Gary was basically telling
you, we spent a lot of time, my whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, that is my career, on working
with fungi and specializing actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit on the signals that fungi make,
a lot of them being what are known as
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are compounds that most people
actually know about, even though they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know they know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the pigments that fungi make,
and you can see in the spores in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular slide here, are melanins that
often are natural products of a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about communication,
and really this entire lecture is now
[SPEAKER_00]: about communication, fungal chemicals,
this is something we learn when we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, in first grade or preschool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have eyes, ears, nose, mouth,
and touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do fungi have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi actually share a lot of perception
as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a nose per se or a mouth
per se, but they do perceive chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: much the same way that, analogously to,
let's say, people with their smell and
[SPEAKER_00]: taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi do have vision as well, and they do
have touch responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about hearing, but today
we're going to talk about chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the chemicals that fungi make
are known as natural products or secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, and these compounds are all
derived from primary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we can have acyl-CoA's that
all organisms make.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to make fatty acids, for example,
or membrane sterols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi and bacteria and plants,
I could say, as well, can take these
[SPEAKER_00]: natural, these acyl-CoA's, they use them
for primary metabolism, but they also
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate them into two big chemical
classes called polyketides and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: malonate pathway into terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then amino acids, which of course fungi
are going to use just as we do for our
[SPEAKER_00]: canonical proteins, they also will take
these amino acids and they will make short
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known mostly as non-ribosomal
peptides, although in our lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found a, in the collaboration with
Frank Schrader's lab at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: we characterize a new chemical class in
fungi called osteocyanides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are the typical secondary
metabolites people now know pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, this is pretty well known by
many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's big efforts for mining fungal
genomes to get these for new drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in fact, we do quite a bit of that in
our lab as well, though I won't touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect of our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these complex natural products here
are almost invariably found in a
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic gene cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This arrangement has been very useful in
the bioinformatics study of fungal natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products because typically in biosynthetic
gene clusters, you'll have the synthase
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes the particular chemical class.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, polyketides are produced by
polyketide synthases, terpene cyclases or
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene synthetases make these compounds,
and non-ribosomal peptide synthases are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for making these metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amino acid sequence in these synthases
is pretty conserved, so you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: find them quite easily using various
algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in a biosynthetic gene cluster,
there's also typically two to 15 tailoring
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes, and these will be enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very critical too because they'll
take that backbone that's derived from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, the polyketide synthase and be
responsible for adding different moieties
[SPEAKER_00]: such as, let's say, a methyl group or will
put in a pimerase and change the oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A biosynthetic gene cluster will often but
not always have a transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that's specific to activate the expression
of the other genes in the cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will often be a protective gene
because some of these compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example is gliotoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus itself has to find a way to
protect itself, and it has an enzyme in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathway that actually will cleave the
gliotoxin to a more harmless compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be hypothetical genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are canonical secondary metabolites
that are produced from biosynthetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all of our secondary metabolites
are coming from biosynthetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to present two of our
latest stories, all involving secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, but one of them is more
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first story is a story of
self-communication, somewhat analogous to
[SPEAKER_00]: the paracrine or autocrine signaling that
some of you might be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, in immunology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi have to know when to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have an aspergillus species,
you have a small resting spore,
[SPEAKER_00]: it swells, it has to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germline then forms, then it has to
branch, and you get heavy branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'll get development of the
knidia for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking about a small
metabolite, a secondary metabolite called
[SPEAKER_00]: an oxylicbin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually is a signal for branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second story is going to turn to the
more canonical natural products,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not just fungal biosynthetic gene
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, let me, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very finicky little mouse here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also will involve some bacterial
natural products and the crosstalk between
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's start with this first story on
branching and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This started long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its roots in plant pathology as
does story two, which I think is fitting
[SPEAKER_00]: for the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago, I got really interested in
understanding how the seed pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus flavus invades seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus flavus produces aflatoxin,
which is the most potent carcinogen known
[SPEAKER_00]: to human time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think of all aspergillus being,
oh, they're saprophytic, they'll grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but actually that's not really
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus, they preferably like certain,
I would say, crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavus grows on seed and it prefers
oilseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became really interested in trying to
ask, why is the oilseed the preferable
[SPEAKER_00]: crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, I was familiar with some
plant studies where certain fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenated fatty acids called oxylipins
were involved in plant defense response to
[SPEAKER_00]: various pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These oxylipins are considered secondary
metabolites, although they're simply made
[SPEAKER_00]: by enzymatic action on unsaturated fatty
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the time I started this study,
I became aware from another lab that
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus species make these oxylipins,
which are sort of similar, somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: structured to the plant oxylipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were already named by another,
the lab that found them as PsiFactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That name isn't really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use that name because it was
precretious sexual induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was known that aspergillus,
I made these and they were involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in finding the enzymes
that made the PsiFactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask, can you see the arrow when I
move the arrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that the plant enzyme that made
these oxylipins for plants were called
[SPEAKER_00]: epoxygenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found in the genome of the fungus
several, and my student actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimitris Tsitsianis is the one who really
was great in finding all of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these oxigenases called PPOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out that they made these
oxylipins and aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not going to go through all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had many, many papers, but the bottom
line is this, is that we found that these
[SPEAKER_00]: PPO enzymes that make the oxigenases,
if you would delete them or overexpressed
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you would actually change the
developmental program of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's wild type aspergillus nidulans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you deleted PPOA, you got much more
asexual growth and no sexual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you deleted PPOC, you would get
the sexual development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a clistothesium, the sexual
fruiting body of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus nidulans and less asexual
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also went on to find that when you
added plant oxylipins to fungal cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would change the development of the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we would take human oxylipins,
because humans make prostaglandins and
[SPEAKER_00]: leukotrienes very similar to another type
of oxylipin, they would also change the
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental plan of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up hypothesizing and putting
forth several papers that we felt that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxylipins were signals, cross-kingdom
signals that acted in a quorum sensing
[SPEAKER_00]: manner with fungi to change development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we could only get so far with all
this research because something that held
[SPEAKER_00]: us back is that we were unable to procure
enough of the fungal oxylipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: No company sells them and it's very hard
to purify enough of them to do very good
[SPEAKER_00]: work with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there was a breakthrough that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to take you right into the
depths of story one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm starting with a map of the world
because story one has a COVID story that I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought concerning the times you might be
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper on where we actually have found
how one of the fungal oxylipins actually
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes branching and fungi is a first
author paper of my student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm thinking of COVID and what she
went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Min Yao, who graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has graduated and she did great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is she submitted her paper
to Nature last Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we knew if it even went
through, we'd have to do gazillion more
[SPEAKER_00]: studies test to actually get it published.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked if she could go home to visit
her parents for Chinese New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes in January, you know what's
happening here, and couldn't come back
[SPEAKER_00]: because the COVID situation in Wuhan,
though she did not live in Wuhan.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went in January and she was only able
to get back to Wisconsin in July two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before her PhD defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, we got the paper back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature said, no, we like it, but why don't
you, it's not quite nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pass you on to nature
communications, which we said,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, that's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we had so much work that had to
be done in the laboratory and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: Min Yao in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually very proud of my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She communicated with everybody in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a community, they got this paper
together and it's been published in Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: Communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, what a world we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highlight is, and let me show you how
we got to this, is that she found,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the many people on the paper,
a specific oxylipin that aspergillus makes
[SPEAKER_00]: and its specific job is to induce
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did she find this?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we did, and we're very
particularly interested in the PPO
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenases because when you delete PPOA,
you have a phenotype with the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grew up the fungus and she asked,
what oxylipins do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: PPOA makes two oxylipins, one called 8-HO,
this is derived from linoleic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one is 5-8-dihod.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she looked at fungal myome,
and the supernatant, she could see that
[SPEAKER_00]: 5-8 was the most dominant and it was also
secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, well, let's see what 5-8 does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to get migs of 5-8 because
another lab had been able to purify it and
[SPEAKER_00]: express it in E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does 5-8 do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some nice movies, but they were so
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to show you these shots
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you add more and more 5-8 into the
culture of the fungus and at physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, you can see there's an increase in
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the branches for 100 microns
of length of hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that you could visualize
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see here, by staining with
calcifluor white, which stains the chitin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see there's more septid too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonly, when you have a branch,
not always, but commonly, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: septal adenir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see that indeed we had a
smaller septal distance when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with this metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then asked, well, are there other
compounds that could induce branching?
[SPEAKER_00]: There had been published in Nature about
15 years ago, the finding that a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolite called a
strigolactone, and this is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: variation of the strigolactone,
will induce branching in our muscular
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae, but just in those fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, well, we better check it
because we hadn't found another chemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it did nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually did not induce branching in
aspergils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be specific for the
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we next did is we bought or had our
collaborator, Ernst Ole, send us minute
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of different oxylippins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here, these top oxylippins
are all vertebrate oxylippins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these three right here are from
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from magnoportha, aspergillus,
and another aspergillus one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found of these oxylippins,
we looked at the branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to get to that right yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branching was specific to these fungal
oxylippins and more than one oxylippin
[SPEAKER_00]: could induce branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know exactly if it's due to
the two hydroxyls, but this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically because we knew other fungi
made these and magnoportha griseae,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf rice blast fungus made 5,8,
we asked, well, is this branching just a
[SPEAKER_00]: response that only aspergillus fumigatus
makes or their other fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a few other fungi and we
found that one other pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus flavus, also significantly
branches when exposed to the 5,8,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the other fungi we looked at,
we didn't look at that many, did not,
[SPEAKER_00]: including magnoportha.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see a significant difference in
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we were bowled over because any
time you added 5,8-diode to magnoportha,
[SPEAKER_00]: you immediately got apricoria formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are plant
pathologists, you know right away that
[SPEAKER_00]: apricoria are the structures that
magnoportha needs to penetrate plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: something we will be looking at further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that this compound actually was a
developmental signal for many fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we knew that oxylipins were
perceived by G-protein-coupled receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next thing we did was take a library
that we'd made some years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: an aspergillus flavus, where we had
deleted the canonical G-protein-coupled
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors of aspergillus flavus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look right here, you can see again
with wild type when you added 5,8-diode to
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus flavus, you had an increase in
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested all of these G-protein-coupled
receptors and we found three where there
[SPEAKER_00]: was not a response or not a significant
response to the 5,8.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was particularly interesting that two
of these G-protein-coupled receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: GPRC and GPRG, we had shown many years
earlier to be necessary for responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant oxylipins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that these particular receptors
on the surface of the fungus are involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in perceiving the fungus's own metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we were fortunate enough,
as I said, to have enough of this 5,8 that
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually went to where we really wanted
to go in the first place, and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had no idea what RNA-seq was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started working with oxylipins
because it had not been a technology at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, but it's a very powerful one as
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that treatment with 5,8 and we
did a 30-minute and 120-minute study
[SPEAKER_00]: because we thought it's a signal,
things are going to happen right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had many, many genes that were
significantly differentially regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that we decided what we would do is
just look at the transcription factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that are differentially regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all in Aspergillus fumigatus now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found 35 transcription factors that
were differentially regulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly differentially regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, 35 is a lot, but luckily,
there is a transcription factor deletion
[SPEAKER_00]: library in Aspergillus fumigatus headed by
Dr. Michael Bromley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael joined our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested these 35 several times and we
came down where Min Yao found that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually three of these transcription
factors that when deleted did not respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5,8.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one, for example, right here
is one, this one did not respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one barely responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two did not respond and in fact,
they actually had abnormal branching
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: After finding these three genes,
she actually went and extracted RNA again
[SPEAKER_00]: just to confirm the RNA-seq results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that two of the genes,
I just have the transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: names, HEO5010, was induced by 5,8.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was induced by 5,8 and two were
repressed by 5,8.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the phenotypes when you looked
at them?
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the five deletion strains that
did not respond normally to 5,8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is wild type, the ethanol carrier and
the 5,8 and you can see the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular mutant, you can say it was
abnormal even without treatment and it did
[SPEAKER_00]: not respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hypo-brancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hypo-brancher and hyper-branchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became really interested in exploring
these a little further, especially the two
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the most significant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, let me just go back here
again, is oftentimes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor, if you overexpress
it, you can have the opposite phenotype as
[SPEAKER_00]: when you delete it, not always,
but sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, well, let's take this strain,
which when you delete it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypo-branching and see if we get a
hyper-brancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, what if we take a hyper-brancher
and when we overexpress it, do we get a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypo-brancher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we reason that if you had the
exact opposite phenotype, you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: find a transcription factor that was very
key in regulating branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is this particular gene
082490, when you overexpress it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me just go back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our favorite gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you delete it, it's a hypo-brancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you overexpress it, it's a
hyper-brancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very thrilled to find this
transcription factor through this
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it had been given a name
before a CFPA, although there had been no
[SPEAKER_00]: research really focused on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just given that name from a
microarray study from another lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we propose here, we end the study as
we have found, to our knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first transcription factor that
regulates branching and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a downstream target of fungal
oxylippins where the signal is mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: through one or more G-protein coupled
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, we believe that this is very
important as not only an autocrine signal
[SPEAKER_00]: for the fungus itself, but likely
paracrine signaling between microbes or
[SPEAKER_00]: host tissue that it grows next to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing right now, one of our big
stories here and interests is we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the immune system, this is a macrophage
and a neutrophil, that they also make
[SPEAKER_00]: oxylippins such as prostaglandins and
leukotrienes that are really important in
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suspect and are now interrogating the
question, are the oxylippins from the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus fumigatus impacting immune
cell response and are oxylippins from the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune cell actually impacting the fungus
by controlling branching once the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also really interested or inviting a
Magna Porta person to work with us on
[SPEAKER_00]: asking, could the plant, the rice
oxylippins, actually be involved and
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized by Magna Porta as part of the
signal to make a apresorium?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our story number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Story number two is now going to move into
our interests in natural product signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: between fungi and bacteria and the
consequences of that signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're returning to canonical secondary
metabolites now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have three projects in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One where we're looking at the soil
microbiome or I could even say plant
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome, with plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the lung microbiome with human
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a collaboration with Ben Wolf
at Tufts University, the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: cheese microbiome with the fungi and
bacteria that grow in cheese rinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of time, I'm going to focus
just on the first one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a bacterium called
Ralstonia solanaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very famous wilt pathogen of many
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mycotoxin producing fusarium
and aspergillus strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this story actually started a little
accidentally, as many studies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first moved to Wisconsin,
before the building that I now am lodged
[SPEAKER_00]: in was built, I shared a lab in the plant
pathology building with Dr. Caitlin Allen,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is a world leader on the bacterium
Ralstonia solanaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we were working with
aspergillus and fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story goes that sometimes there'd
be low contamination of aspergillus spore
[SPEAKER_00]: that went into Ralstonia plate and things
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that the two microbes
responded to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years later, we know what's happening
between these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response of these organisms to
each other is in part mediated by three
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lipopeptide, we call rasolamycin made by
the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non-ribosomal peptide, we call imizoquin
made by aspergillus flavus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a polyketide made by fusarium species
is called bicaverin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These papers are published.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into them into great detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shout out to our excellent collaboration
with Dr. Frank Schrader's lab on these
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from these natural products,
there is also a visual response when these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms grow each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really important for this
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have Ralstonia growing and here we
have aspergillus flavus growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this particular plate
where they're very close to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that there's these bumps all
over the mycelium of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bumps were so big that you can see
it with the dissecting scope and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even without the dissecting scope if you
can squint.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is that the fungus was
producing clemitis spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it grew near the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clemitis spore for those who are not
familiar is a very large resistant spore
[SPEAKER_00]: to environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can either grow within the mycelium
intercalary or terminally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's characterized by a very thick cell
wall with a lot of chitin in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: usually has a lot of nuclei in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were really pretty surprised to
see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because aspergillus is not known for
making clemitis spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fungi make a lot, but most really
weren't known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we found this, we thought there
was something that the bacterium was
[SPEAKER_00]: producing that was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, and we'll get to that in
one second, but the other thing we became
[SPEAKER_00]: really interested in was, wow,
these clemitis spores are so big,
[SPEAKER_00]: could the bacteria possibly be going in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a GFP labeled strain from Dr.
Allen and we found that indeed the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria would induce the clemitis spores
and then go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a movie of a Z stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some clemitis spore had hundreds,
some had thousands of bacteria in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did the bacterium induce these
clemitis spores?
[SPEAKER_00]: That became our next query.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that it was due to a lipopeptide
that the bacterium made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through all the story
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published, but the bacteria makes a
lipopeptide called ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has antifungal effects at high
concentrations and it induces the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of the clemitis spores in the
bacterium that enter the clemitis spores
[SPEAKER_00]: if you delete the genes and the bacterium
so you no longer have the lipopeptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no antifungal effect and the
hyphae is nice and pristine with no
[SPEAKER_00]: clemitis spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seemed to us at the time that perhaps
not necessarily something that was helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for the fungus or, oh, I guess you could,
it was six and one half a dozen of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that antifungal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clemitis spores are spores that are
very resistant to abiotic stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, heat, acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a lot of bacteria go in it,
is that going to obfuscate the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the advantage of making these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to ask, what does the fungus
do when confronted with ralsolamycin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again, we actually did another
RNA sequence where we grew the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: either with ralsolamycin present or
without ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked for genes that were
significantly up or down regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, what's very interesting to us was
a secondary metabolite gene cluster that
[SPEAKER_00]: is normally never expressed to high
degrees in the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, but to some degree,
but it was down regulated by ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to characterize this as this
non-ribosomal peptide called imozoquine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make a long story short from this
particular paper, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: imozoquines are actually important for
quick spore germination in aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they inhibit the growth of
ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas ralsolamycin made by ralstonia
actually inhibits the expression of this
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that inhibits the growth of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really interesting antagonism
between two natural products that respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it seemed like perhaps in
favor of the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we are working on this,
we noticed that in the fusarium species,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chlamydospores, which are smaller than
aspergillus, but many of them all turned
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about, here's one that's not red yet,
but it will turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also enters inside this chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacterium goes in all chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wondered what this red compound was,
and we were able to do some imaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: found out that this compound was a fungal
polyketide known as bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had already been discovered,
but nobody had shown that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that this treatment where
we have the fungus and the bacterium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bicarbonate is really produced in
great amounts right at the edge where the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlamydospores are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found is that opposite of
aspergillus, that keeps flicking very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly here, we found that this
bicarbonate gene cluster is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: induced by ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought maybe this was giving the
fungus some advantage, so we deleted the
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate genes in fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at Ralstonia growth in
confrontation with wild-type fusarium or
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium that lacked bicarbonate,
and you can see that actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium grew better when there was no
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little complex here,
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also showed that ralsolamycin induced,
as I said, bicarbonate production in
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's really interesting is
bicarbonate is always known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibited by high nitrogen, but if you add
ralsolamycin, it will allow the fungus to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the bicarbonate genes
are induced when you add ralsolamycin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went on to show then that
bicarbonate, oh, I showed you this a
[SPEAKER_00]: little earlier, that bicarbonate reduced
Ralstonia growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with whole extracts of the fungus,
but we also got purified bicarbonate and
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that purified bicarbonate actually
reduced bacterial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we concluded from this particular
interaction that yes, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ralstonia induced the chlamytospores in
fusarium, just as it does in every fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bacteria would enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of fusarium, it actually
would induce the production of a
[SPEAKER_00]: polyketide only in the chlamytospore where
the bacteria entered and reduced the
[SPEAKER_00]: population, the number of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these studies are all published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to end though with a
continuation of this work by another
[SPEAKER_00]: student in the lab, Nandita Venkatesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to reiterate, again, I think I'd
mentioned that Ralstonia, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a wilt pathogen, but so is fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that Nandita has been looking
at is, well, what happens when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these two pathogens together, knowing that
Ralstonia can actually enter a
[SPEAKER_00]: chlamytospore of fusarium, at least in the
laboratory?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is bicarbon doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is work that is in preparation by
Nandita.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we found is that when you
have Ralstonia, it does kill tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium oxysperum is a slower killer,
but it will eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you mix them together,
it looked more like a fusarium phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she has found, and we're still
doing some work on this, is that for
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons yet to be explained, when you mix
fusarium and Ralstonia together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually reduce the high severity of a
bacterial wilt disease, but it is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more than the fungus by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she went ahead to do a co-culture
with Ralstonia and the bicarbon mutant of
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually a bit more wilt,
so it appears that bicarbon actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing to some degree the severity of
wilt disease by Ralstonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then, she's not quite finished with
this yet, but we started to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, okay, is there any benefit to the
bacterium when it's in the soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: presumably it is with the fusarium?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have found that in this little
mini winter study that the Ralstonia does
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better when fusarium is there,
which we hypothesize is because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to enter and survive in the
chlamydospores of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to really get deep into understanding
what's happening with this interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bacterium and the chlamydospores,
Nandita has gotten really much further,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're very shortly to submit this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is just a time lapse where you can
see the chlamydospores forming in fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium when it's added to, when
rosolamycin is added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nandita found it takes minimal amounts of
rosolamycin and way less than the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: makes to induce these chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see it, way down at this
molarity, we still get significant numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: of rosolamycin, of chlamydospores,
and the bacteria makes a much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: amount than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first wanted to see, okay,
how many chlamydospores do you get and
[SPEAKER_00]: what molarity of rosolamycin do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what Nandita did is she developed
a Z-stacking methodology so she could see
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria going inside the
chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why she did this, you can see right
here, is we had a hypothesis that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, if rosolamycin is in the soil,
could other bacteria get inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus, or is it limited to ralstonia?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she found a lot of bacteria could go
inside the chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
opportunistic human pathogen, and her
[SPEAKER_00]: vasperilium, which is a nitrogen-fixing
bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she did is went through and examined
as many gram-negative and gram-positive
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that we could find from
researchers in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a little story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found we were able to look at three
gram-positive, they never enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she looked at five different
gram-negatives and all except for this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, bacillus, will enter the
chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed to be that many, a broad
range of these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting to us is when she
looked at these and looked at a
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetic tree, the fungi that went
inside the chlamydospore were never known
[SPEAKER_00]: to be endofungal bacteria before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in red are the known endofungal
bacteria, but we found that ralstonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: her vasperilium, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and Pseudomonas also went inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe this is the first time there's
evidence for these fungi to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this something that's just limited
to raw solomycin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nandita looked in the literature and she
found that there's many lipopeptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's just some of them, that have
been reported in the literature to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to think, could this
actually be widespread?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were able to do, she was able
to do, is get a isolate of bacillus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild type that made Fingusin that had
been shown to induce chlamydospores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one that was deleted for producing
Fingusin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that indeed, when you had
Fingusin, and this happens to be with
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflavus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
we get chlamydospores and Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: enters inside the chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting very exciting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of lipopeptides,
a lot of bacteria, a lot of bacteria going
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing she wanted to ask was,
well, will a chlamydospore only house one
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium, or could there be more than one
bacterium?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a case where we either,
she either co-cultured Ralstonia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus alone, or Pseudomonas and
Aspergillus, or both Ralstonia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is they both go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did note that when they were
introduced, sort of would change the ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: of how much each bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a situation in E,
where we just had the fungus and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ralstonia, and she waited a certain time
period and found about 15% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlamydospores were colonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she co-incubated Ralstonia and
Pseudomonas, she found, and now she's just
[SPEAKER_00]: counting Ralstonia, that there was an
increase in the number of Ralstonia that
[SPEAKER_00]: were inside the chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: She then did the same experiment,
but she allowed Pseudomonas to arrive at
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungal court earlier than Ralstonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she did that, we saw an increase
in the number of Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that obviously more than one
bacterium can go inside the chlamydospore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the relative amount of which bacterium
is there might depend on which bacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing she looked at is asked,
does this colonization really,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it give any advantage to the
bacterium?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little hint earlier that it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she wanted to look at this a little
bit further under controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have an example of the impact
growing the bacterium with the funguses
[SPEAKER_00]: under starvation conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what she did here, let's just look at
the Ralstonia and Flavus interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would grow the bacterium, either a
wild type bacterium that made Ralsolemysin
[SPEAKER_00]: or this one that does not make
Ralsolemysin, so no chlamydospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she grew them in a situation
where there was lots of nutrients for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium, both the wild type bacterium
and the bacterium lacking Ralsolemysin
[SPEAKER_00]: grew equally with Aspergillus Flavus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when she grew them under a
situation where there was no nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: under starvation, you can see here that
the bacterium that actually made
[SPEAKER_00]: Ralsolemysin and could therefore go into
chlamydospores grew much better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: poor bacterium without a lipopeptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found exactly the same thing with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggested to us that the bacterium
actually does receive some benefit by
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to enter inside the
chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave you a lot of what she has worked
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other tests she did,
but I would like to conclude with this
[SPEAKER_00]: second story right now by saying what we
think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that this is widespread in
nature, that actually chlamydospore
[SPEAKER_00]: formation in fungi is induced by
lipopeptides that are made by many
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows bacteria one or more than one to
enter inside a fungal chlamydospore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will protect them in different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with soil, but of course,
all the microbes we are working with are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually those that could be found in the
human microbiome or in even other places
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the cheese microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are now about, as I say,
to submit this that we believe that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should consider the chlamydospore as
having its own bacterial microbiome inside
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will stop with those two stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more, but I'm conscious of the
time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to end this talk,
show you what it looks like when there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no COVID virus at Madison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we hope will come back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show in red the two people who really
actually did most of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Min Yao for the oxylipid branching
signaling and Nandita for this really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting bacterial fungal microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listed in yellow are those that helped Min
Yao during our COVID crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to shout out to Frank
Schrader, because a lot of the work that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, some of our earlier work,
he's been crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: For helping and with Min Yao, also Dr.
Oli, Nupsela Sweden, who actually made
[SPEAKER_00]: some oxylipids for us, and Dave Bibi,
who helped us with some microfluidic
[SPEAKER_00]: devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nancy, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a terrific seminar there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure they'll, I don't see anything
in the chat room yet, but I'd encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody to put your questions in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Nancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always proud of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is no exception.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regarding the first story and the
transcription factor induced by the
[SPEAKER_03]: oxylipid, do you have any idea about the
conservation of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Transcription factor across fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a little bit of an idea about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we looked in aspergillus flavus
and it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the next studies will be to see
if it also regulates branching there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem to be pretty good homologs in
ascomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be really interesting to look at
some other fungi to see what it does with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are there any other morphological
developmental effects other than branching
[SPEAKER_03]: and possibly atpresorium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is that this is a
signal for inducing secondary metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so a lot of the canonical secondary
metabolites, we believe there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence to suggest, well, some evidence
that they're associated with the endocytic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think they're associated with the
growing tips and septa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we will be exploring that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium signaling too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of calcium signaling genes
that are upregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary, are you seeing questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are a couple of questions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a couple of applauses,
I shall say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a question here from Said.
[SPEAKER_02]: How will rostonia be freed from the
clemenis spore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it easily go in and out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it need to await germination?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the clemenis spore to escape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a 100% answer for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Nandita has sometimes, but sometimes
not, seen as the fungus germinates,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacterium traveling through the
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the time, but sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that this does happen on
occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that clemenis spore germinates,
and I should write, oh, man, you get 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 germ tubes coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so big that the bacteria can go out
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it can also go out through cell wall
remodeling too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a follow-up question there from Raleigh
is, any ideas on how the bacteria enter
[SPEAKER_02]: the spore?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then can you speculate why gram
positives cannot gain access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some ideas that we want to
follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Nandita will.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does want to graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're wondering if some of the type 3
or some of the secretion systems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gram positive and gram negative have
different secretion systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gram positives, I don't think this is
why it stops them from going inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have some nice pictures where they
like to stick on the hyphae on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that shouldn't preclude them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking it might have something to
do with these secretion systems of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Maria Harrison asked a very similar
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephen Higgins said you get a great talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, not all ralstonia enter the
clemenis spore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any nutrient signals in these
spores that attract some ralstonia over
[SPEAKER_02]: others?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we want to ask in the future is,
the clemitis spores have a lot of lipid
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just chock full of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're guessing the bacteria might be
living off of the lipid body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's several ways we could address
that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have anything specific right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any other questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions in there right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to remind you, Nancy, that your
talk has been recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be sure to get you that
recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use for other occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure I know I'm meeting with some
of the postdocs and grad students.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see that you're right on the button
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to start at 1.45.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why don't I suggest that you'll need a
little bit of a break and then ask the
[SPEAKER_02]: students and postdocs to rejoin you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Zoom link that was provided to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I went over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will join the postdocs and grad students
very shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's give a round of virtual applause
for Nancy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Nancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
Thank you.
Thank you.
