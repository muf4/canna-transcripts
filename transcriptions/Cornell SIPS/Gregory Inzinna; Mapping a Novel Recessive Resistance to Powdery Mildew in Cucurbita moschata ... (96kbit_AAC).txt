[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Charlie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to talking a lot with my hands,
so I'll try to hold this close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the employee degree program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Moonlight as a squash breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in charge of the breeding program
along with Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people know we do all kinds of
cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, the cucurbits from all over the
world, beans, peas, and peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'm here to tell you about the
novel resistance gene that we found in
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbita moshata, resistance against
powdery mildew, and our search for markers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yep, squash and pumpkins, cucurbita
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year, we all have them in our
bellies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pumpkin pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have jack-o'-lanterns on our doorsteps
rotting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three main species is cucurbita pipo,
which is your smaller jack-o'-lanterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: an acorn squash, a yellow squash,
a spaghetti squash, and many other
[SPEAKER_00]: squirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cucurbita maxima, which has our cabochus
squashes, a buttercup squash, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably saw giant pumpkins in the
news recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They broke another world record for their
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds are going for $1,000 apiece,
so make sure to save your giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, as long as they don't
have PVP, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then finally, we have a cucurbita
moshata, which we're here to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our butternut-type squash,
tropical pumpkins, calabaza, and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: processing pumpkin, field pumpkin,
Dickinson, which is actually, if you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkin pie filling in a can, it primarily
comes from this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a giant watermelon-shaped
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so for powdery mildew resistance,
between all the three species,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's currently a single source of
powdery mildew resistance that Henry
[SPEAKER_00]: Munger introgressed from cucurbita
martinisii in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought it over into cucurbita moshata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be a dominant source of
resistance in chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our novel source of powdery mildew
resistance does not have that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to go about finding out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, single gene resistances are
fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are happy to soon be able to offer
this powdery mildew resistance in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially viable line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out to identify the inheritance
and segregation ratios for this novel
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistance or gene-type
resistant septal bulks from the F2
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did actually a greenhouse screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very soon going to generate a
marker set and identify candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created some back-cross populations
this summer so that we can verify the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully in the next four to five
years, we hope to have some commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators that we can offer with this
powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to do a screen for powdery
mildew with the F2 population,
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected powdery mildew spores from the
field and I inoculated a flat of
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this key for powdery mildew
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked to me to be most likely a
Canadian formed in chains like a
[SPEAKER_00]: protosphera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photo I took using a microscope
with a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also looked at it with a better
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems to me to be
protospherazanthi, which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most common powdery mildew in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aircephi, chikoracearum is the other
common powdery mildew that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbits, but I did not see it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those other spikes are trichomes on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the setup of our greenhouse
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically had 10 plants in a 15 cell
flat with four-inch pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either we had 10 plants of the F2,
10 plants of one of the controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: parental controls, F1s, reverse F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this doesn't look like a lot,
but this is a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is close to like 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Michael spent many days evaluating
all these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during COVID, so we had to wear
masks and it wasn't a whole lot of fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we got it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the data will show we have
some high quality data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we had a bugle in the
greenhouse so we could compare it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: current commercial source of powdery
mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was produced by us lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some images of the plants to get
an idea of what to expect in the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at all the controls and we
evaluated them on the leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: the underside of the leaf, the petioles
and the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you could see here is Waltham,
the susceptible control, has mildew all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the leaf surface on the underside of
the leaf, the petioles, the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugle, the commercial source of powdery
mildew resistance has a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew on the leaf surface, but not really
any mildew on the stems or petioles on the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at our novel source of powdery
mildew resistance, it's hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of sporulation,
but very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does get a little bit necrosis,
but it keeps growing and does very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at both the F1s,
between our novel powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and Waltham, we see mildew all
over the stems, all over the leafs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't appear to be a very dominant
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at it 20 days later,
we see about same thing, as I just
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the F1s are about dying from powdery
mildew, as is Waltham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugle is surviving it okay, but it does
have mildew on the leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our novel powdery mildew resistance
source looks pretty clean and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves do senesce and get a little
necrosis, but whatever the action of this
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistance is, it seems to
prevent any sporulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between bugle and the
novel powdery mildew resistance seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be leaf surface sporulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're gonna look at the data from
me and Michael looking at these hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the stem has very little mildew on
either of the resistance sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's plenty of mildew susceptible
in both the F1s, the petiole is about the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to be a little something going on
there with the F1s, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, on leaf four, on the bottom is
about the same, both the resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: sources are very low, the susceptible and
F1s have about 25% leaf coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, when we look at the top of
leaf four for this resistance source,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where it stands out from bugle,
our novel powdery mildew resistance source
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out against bugle with the PMO
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we wanted to think about the F2
population and what we should use to score
[SPEAKER_00]: as resistant and susceptible, this is a
graph of the F2 scores of the whole F2
[SPEAKER_00]: population and the leaf scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to draw this red line in
the sand about where at the upper bounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of the standard deviation for the novel
resistance source, kind of saying this is
[SPEAKER_00]: about where we see a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we ran our chi-square test for a
three to one ratio, I got a p-value of
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.427, which looks very probable that this
has at least a single major gene
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like a recessive resistance,
perhaps there's some quantitative aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: and some modifiers, but it looks pretty
strongly to be a recessive resistance or a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say, Greg, that was a great
greenhouse screen, but what about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw in September this year, throughout
all the controls, Waltham and the two F1s
[SPEAKER_00]: had very little leafs left after the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bugle had quite a bit of leaves,
more than Waltham or the two F1s between
[SPEAKER_00]: our novel powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our novel powdery mildew resistance
has its full foliage, and yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does produce fruit, and they don't
taste too bad, but they're not a type of
[SPEAKER_00]: squash that many people would recognize in
this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking forward to intergress it
into some more common types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for genotyping, going back to the
greenhouse screen, we extracted DNA from
[SPEAKER_00]: the 22 resistant and 22 susceptible F2
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parents, we did NexSeq 500-550
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about 40x coverage on the parents
and 4x coverage on the individuals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I ran the reads through a
QTL-Seq biocondit package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I outputted a VCF file, which was then
further annotated by SNPF package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes the annotated VCF file,
which also has a delta SNP index on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a significant hit on chromosome
13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got over the 99% confidence interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple other places where it got
close to the 95% confidence interval,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it never breached the 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at chromosome 13, I divided up
the region into about 100,000 base pair
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks, trying to find maps of region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent away for some primers for
developing markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the primer should be in our
mailbox right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to take remnant DNA
from the resistant individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this week, run some PCR on
those to try to find out which markers are
[SPEAKER_00]: most closely correlated with this
resistance trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fairly this summer, we'll test
the markers on the bat cross population
[SPEAKER_00]: that I developed this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soon we'll also verify a different
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully in four to five years,
we should be able to have a resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar to release to the growers and
seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited to be able to offer
growers and other sorts of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in cucurbitum oceata that will
help reduce fungicide use and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: slow the development of fungicide
resistant powdery mildew strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to my committee,
Michael, and Anurag Agarwal, and Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabrizio for helping me with the genetics,
genomics, and everybody in MADS lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courtney, I think, did the seeds for the
greenhouse screen, and our harvest fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any plans to stack the two
genes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need benefits from a stack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we want to try very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, as I said, yeah,
the bugle genes that came from cucurbitum
[SPEAKER_00]: artinidae is on chromosome 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully they have a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There tends to be a little bit of a trade
off with the powdery mildew resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to, in years when there's a
lot of powdery mildew, they tend to do
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the susceptible cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see if there's a benefit to
having it stacked or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering if you know anything
about if there's any races for powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew, and is there a potential for major
gene resistance for powdery mildew to
[SPEAKER_02]: overcome it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think there are as many
races.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to look at it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Munger and Molly John did a lot of
work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't reviewed the literature in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll have to take a look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's definitely potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that you tried or you evaluated both
the reciprocal process between the
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible and the other one,
using the reciprocal pair of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we had there when I had the
two F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, if there is any effect
reported or that you found that is
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on which part is used as a
female or as a pale?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem like there was much of an
effect either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I look at my data, it looks
like the scores are flip-flopped on one or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes one did a little bit better on
other parts of the patio or the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there wasn't much difference on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think either time they didn't have a
statistical difference between either of
[SPEAKER_00]: the F1s or any of the locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The copper sulfate treatment can decrease
the signal of the infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, could you repeat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the beginning part.
[SPEAKER_03]: The copper sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the copper sulfate, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, is there any differences
of the torrent line and susceptible line
[SPEAKER_03]: to the cheese?
[SPEAKER_00]: The copper sulfate?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure, but that would be
something, definitely an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: question to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
