[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, thank you for this invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give a bit of a disclaimer that
– so I'm going to give really a – it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a public relations event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give a talk that is a
version of a talk that I gave at the BTI.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very well amplified, it feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it's Magdalene Lindbergh who
invited me to come – give it again here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to point to one vision of
the opportunities and try to illustrate it
[SPEAKER_02]: with projects that I know of around
campus, around heavily the College of
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineering, but also physical sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll put in a few projects from
published work from other places in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll start out with a naive outsider's
perspective on why plant scientists might
[SPEAKER_02]: look more to these emerging and future
physical science tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm offensive, it'd be good if you told
me because – so I won't continue to be
[SPEAKER_02]: offensive about my assumptions about the
state of plant science and important
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come to this having interacted with
plant scientists here and elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also having been part of a big growth
area at Cornell in looking at engineering
[SPEAKER_02]: questions in biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very naive early on in thinking
that – but not completely wrong – in
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking that there are a lot of
similarities between the organism scale as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as the cellular and molecular scale
of mammalian systems and plant systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's, of course, a very coarse view,
but in terms of technology development,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's reason to believe that the
analogies can be powerful and there may be
[SPEAKER_02]: translation from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now why bring up mammals in a plant
science department?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because they – the mammalian
biologists in particular in the biomedical
[SPEAKER_02]: field have heavily engaged engineers in
technology development to a level that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is – well, maybe scales with the
size of human biology relative to plant
[SPEAKER_02]: science, but there's been a lot of
technology development in these past
[SPEAKER_02]: decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one way to say this is why not
bring nanotechnology and other
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies to plant science?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one is that they've gone to human
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gone from being molecular tools
through cellular tools to being clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: tools that are interfaces with the living
organism so it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: dissected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll point to some of these examples
that ought to be able to be translated in
[SPEAKER_02]: some form to plant biology and
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now working in attempts to bring
technology to plants, I understand also
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are important differences that
in some ways it's harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants don't let you in as easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have soft skin often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And disrupting them can have dire
consequences that – and in some ways
[SPEAKER_02]: mammalian systems are more agreeable to
some of these interventions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highlight the hypodermic needle because
this is one of the absolute workhorses of
[SPEAKER_02]: biomedical intervention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would argue that essentially we
don't have a hypodermic needle for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are important reasons why we
don't, but it'd be awful nice if we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So agriculture, I think a lot of people
think of engineering in plant science as
[SPEAKER_02]: being things you stick to a tractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been the definition for
many decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still is an important target.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one way to see it is – one thing that
has surprised me – I was first surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: to know how heavily agriculture has
invested in smart irrigation strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten million hectares is a reasonably
recent estimate globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet almost never is that on a closed
loop feedback because they don't ask the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants how much water they want or ask
even the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here you have what is an advanced
approach running free, running on
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's intuition about what should be
going on in terms of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example – and these are topics
that I'm interested in – it's uninformed
[SPEAKER_02]: by parameters that are relatively coarse
but have been shown to be crucially
[SPEAKER_02]: important like water potential,
stem water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's been shown that crop
productivity, quality correlate with this
[SPEAKER_02]: one simple seeming parameter in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we have no practical way to go and
ask even a sampling of plants in the field
[SPEAKER_02]: what their water stress levels are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today the techniques are now mostly 60
years old and coarse and manual and hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to use, not giving you real-time data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's an important advantage
that plants have been going on in remote
[SPEAKER_02]: sensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think – and they can give beautiful
information – I think what I'd like to see
[SPEAKER_02]: is bringing into the plant, getting local
physiological data into that potential
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another place that I've been learning more
recently what the realities today are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are about breeding programs and selection
of better crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's, it seems to me, a beautiful
challenge for the engineering community
[SPEAKER_02]: that most engineers have no idea about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took me a number of years working
with plant scientists before truly
[SPEAKER_02]: learning the realities of what it is to
select a better plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here I'm showing science fiction,
a patch on – that you could – a few cent
[SPEAKER_02]: patch that you could go along and put on
many, many different crosses, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get something local physiological back
during a growing season outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually partly meeting with Ed
Buckler that crystallized this challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He – and this is a paraphrase,
but he basically told me, if you can
[SPEAKER_02]: measure a trait 10,000 times, I'll find
you the gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't – you may – you know better
than I whether he's correct about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks from his publication record like
could well be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this challenge, thousands of
reproducible quantitative measurements on
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, that's a great challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one that engineers should know
about, should be going after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it's possible,
not for every definition of a trait,
[SPEAKER_02]: every phenotype, every protein,
but for some crucial ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, I got to say, I saw a talk by
Pioneer, and they – and they – it was –
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe he was retired from Pioneer,
and he admitted that, in his opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf angle had been the biggest change in
phenotype that had defined increases in
[SPEAKER_02]: yields in their breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be an oversimplification,
but I was shocked that that's what – that
[SPEAKER_02]: these extraordinarily sophisticated
molecular biologists deal with extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: coarse physiological information,
extremely coarse definitions of what a
[SPEAKER_02]: trait is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can understand why, because you have
to measure it thousands of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to measure it in complicated
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's – it's in some sense,
it's the engineer end of the problem
[SPEAKER_02]: that's failed in this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that the molecular tools
are incredible, but if you're applying
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular tools, the absolute
state-of-the-art in genetic analysis to
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf angle, that seems unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know – so we – I have a very naive,
again, perspective on what the molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: and cellular questions in plant biology
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just giving one example here of
where I see opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I was surprised to learn about
the state of knowledge in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example of – it's a review
saying that direct evidence of the motion
[SPEAKER_02]: – the movement of a peptide has yet been –
not been achieved in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that this particular flowering locust
tea is – in 2013 was said to be the only
[SPEAKER_02]: example of long-range signaling by a
protein in the plant – in a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this seems like – again, this is a
challenge across biological fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to integrate information – extremely
sophisticated information about individual
[SPEAKER_02]: cells and molecular processes with
organism scale processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a place where, in biomedical
engineering, there's been a lot of – it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been a rich area for making progress to
get to the tissue scale, get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: organism scale with hypotheses about –
with molecular hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's another opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to talk about three
perspectives on how – and I'm going to –
[SPEAKER_02]: again, I'm going to illustrate them with
lots of people's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about what I call
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where Cornell has been a
leader in developing small-scale devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that energy over – in the
time I've been at Cornell has been pointed
[SPEAKER_02]: towards human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much of it pointed towards plant
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a missed opportunity to
date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell is also extremely good in imaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know many of you probably use
advanced imaging techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is a – this has been
continued to be leaders in the world in
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced imaging techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also models.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's models that I'm going to focus on
not bioinformatic like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioinformatic models, but more – what we
call systems biology models, which again
[SPEAKER_02]: look to integrate information from the
molecular across to the cellular and to
[SPEAKER_02]: the physical – the full animal – full
organism physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start with devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just point out that there's a –
Cornell has a tradition in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the workhorses of soil science and
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was invented here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some argument about precedent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Richard Soil Tenseometer is still
the only tool to measure precisely across
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant physiological range of drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: The few bars of tension that are relevant
to most agriculturally relevant plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versions of this technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think many – most of you know the gene
gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, both of these came from
CALS.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't come from the engineering
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's – I'll admit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think these are two technologies –
historic technologies that came out of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell that are precedent for what should
be being done here still today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to turn to a number of
technologies that I don't know of being
[SPEAKER_02]: used in plants, but I think could be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this – Erwin de Waalmeck is a new
faculty member in biomedical engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something he's working on
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a publication he published
just before he came here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example of using a
microfluidic system, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: miniaturized lab that can handle extremely
small-scale samples, to collect
[SPEAKER_02]: single-stranded DNA out of the blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that has an important –
in the context of transplant – biology of
[SPEAKER_02]: transplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is one of many examples of doing
molecular biological analysis on what
[SPEAKER_02]: would have previously been thought of as
being unusable samples, the contents of a
[SPEAKER_02]: single cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do analysis on the contents of a
single cell today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still – that's still a challenge,
but it's the kind of advance that is
[SPEAKER_02]: represented by nanobiotechnology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example from Harold Craighead's
group in applied physics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is, I think, maybe the person who
coined the name nanobiotechnology when he
[SPEAKER_02]: started the Nanotechnology Center here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the big themes has been
manipulation of biomacromolecules and,
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular, DNA that has led to the
beginnings of what is now becoming a
[SPEAKER_02]: reality of single-molecule sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example – I believe this is
an example of mapping epigenetic change at
[SPEAKER_02]: the single-molecular scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you see here is what nano –
this is a truly – here the features that
[SPEAKER_02]: were created in Cornell's nanofab are of a
molecular dimension, and forcing this DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: to take on a conformation that allows it
to be literally read with microscopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another example from applied
physics of creating a cell culture that
[SPEAKER_02]: has – that allows electrophysiology to be
done with subcellular resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this involves both the traditional
patch clamp-type approach, but also the
[SPEAKER_02]: cell that is living on a circuit that
allows the group to interface with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: watch for events.
[SPEAKER_02]: That occur – to triangulate to where these
events are occurring on a subcellular
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving up a little bit – and a number of
these ideas are about cultured tissues and
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is – there's a difference in how
important that is in plant biology than in
[SPEAKER_02]: mammalian biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think – I hope that some of these
examples trigger some ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideas about where the translation could
occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an example from Mike Schuler's
group, who – I still claim him from my
[SPEAKER_02]: department.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually shared with biomedical
engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example of, in fact,
building a mimic, a replica, of the
[SPEAKER_02]: connectivity of tissues in a mammalian
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you see here liver, fat,
kidney.
[SPEAKER_02]: And coupling them with – a very primitive
vascular system, but one that allows the
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolic environment and the signaling to
interact with these different tissues in a
[SPEAKER_02]: manner that simulates time scales and
transformations that occur in the
[SPEAKER_02]: different tissues in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this type of replication of tissue
properties, of the tissue environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: is something that there's a lot of –
there's a lot of know-how now,
[SPEAKER_02]: both from the material side, the
fabrication side, and in some cases the
[SPEAKER_02]: biological side, about what are the
influences of the tissue environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: the communication between tissues within a
full organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example, again, that is called
a tissue engineering effort from my lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: of focus on the microvascular structure of
humans, which is, like the phloem in a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, is built of living cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vessels on the smallest scale are
really formed of a single layer of
[SPEAKER_02]: endothelial cells that have a huge amount
of biology associated with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, it's a bottleneck for
forming any big tissue, is to
[SPEAKER_02]: simultaneously form its vascular system,
if you're going to do an engineering
[SPEAKER_02]: process to form a tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally – and I've spoken to very few
people about this, but I wonder – it would
[SPEAKER_02]: seem, naively, that tissue engineering
might be a whole lot more fun and easy in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, in some ways, that creating –
because plants might just go with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there may not be – there's not the
clinical vision of bringing somebody a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab-grown heart, but actually,
today, much of tissue engineering is done
[SPEAKER_02]: to recreate a multicellular structure to
study it, study its biology at that
[SPEAKER_02]: multicellular scale without – there are
very few examples today of translation,
[SPEAKER_02]: truly, to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, in that same spirit, I could
imagine that it could be interesting for –
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of plant biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an effort that I thought was
exciting from northwestern – for
[SPEAKER_02]: northeastern, not from Cornell,
but it's an example – another example of
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a microenvironment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case – so, again, what we call
a microfluidic system that has microscale
[SPEAKER_02]: features inside this cartridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is – they – by creating that
environment and in burying it in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were able to grow up a huge number of
uncultivatable microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, they managed to isolate
promising antibiotics that had been unseen
[SPEAKER_02]: previously, because if you just took the
soil, you had too little of any one
[SPEAKER_02]: species to produce that small molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, this is – I wish – I wish it had
been an idea here, but it's an example
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think it's worth noting that one
place – and, in fact, Harvey Hoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a plant pathologist, was one of the
early people to interact with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanobiotechnology Center, one of the most
active biologists at the Nanobiotechnology
[SPEAKER_02]: Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one reason to recreate these mimics or
replicas, these engineered tissues – it
[SPEAKER_02]: may be more about plant pathology than it
is about the plant biology on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is one of the first efforts – the
first targets that my group went after was
[SPEAKER_02]: to build synthetic xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because plants do something that
engineers don't, that humans basically
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, which is use liquids under tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, we made very, very simple
replicas, and it was really more about a
[SPEAKER_02]: materials question of how to build a
network that coupled to the outside in a
[SPEAKER_02]: way that allowed the fluid in these tiny
vessels to go under tension in the manner
[SPEAKER_02]: that's proposed by CT – cohesion tension
theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that it's – we,
from a – in a synthetic system,
[SPEAKER_02]: validated cohesion tension theory,
which has nice consequences physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's – it brings us into a new regime
physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it also gives us an
opportunity to, for example, understand
[SPEAKER_02]: the design ideas from the purely physical
point of view of the – here, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: the segmented xylem structure,
seeing these events of embolization
[SPEAKER_02]: occurring independently as has all – long
been proposed for the redundant segmented
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also thought that – and I've spoke to
Harvey about this before he retired – that
[SPEAKER_02]: this creates an unusual environment,
the environment of the xylem in the leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, where important pathogens
live that is unlike any other environment
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what is it like to be a microbe that
lives with the fluid pressure around it
[SPEAKER_02]: going from zero to minus 20 bars up and
down and up and down?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, it's also potentially a bioreactor
environment to study the biology of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant-pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we've done with it is –
and this was Alan Lacso – we were building
[SPEAKER_02]: a device that extrapolated from our
synthetic tree to put – to have a cavity
[SPEAKER_02]: of liquid with – and this is – it's a
strange geometry, but this gray area
[SPEAKER_02]: around is a nanoporous membrane that
allows the liquid in this cavity to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: tension when it's exposed to a dry
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we were building it to have
direct mechanical sensing so that we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have a direct measure of that stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alan came to find out what this
synthetic tree was and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we showed him this that we were
building as a laboratory to study liquids
[SPEAKER_02]: under tension, he said, oh, well,
that's a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hadn't known about Richard and the
whole challenge of tensiometry until that
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized that this was,
in fact, a miniature Richard's
[SPEAKER_02]: tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, like I told you, we've come to
appreciate that that tensiometry,
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring drought stress, as a stress,
as a tension, is the most sensitive way to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure that thermodynamic state of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having here a strain gauge on a
diaphragm over this cavity allows us to
[SPEAKER_02]: have quantitative measures of the water
potential in the environment around this
[SPEAKER_02]: device.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, this is our champion of
this generation of these devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured, it went to an embolization
event at 300 bars of tension, or water
[SPEAKER_02]: potential of minus 300 bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to, this is, I don't know if this
will, yeah, maybe, to actually see,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which of these work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to actually see embolization is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That this is the release, this is the
click that acoustic measurements hear,
[SPEAKER_02]: this dramatic release of the tension upon
embolization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it turns out we've been continued
with Alan and Taryn to pursue this so that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's truly practical for plant science
measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here is our current generation of
this device, which is, as you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: here, down to a relatively small package.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm failing to get a pointer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, in this format, it's just,
it's like a pinky fingernail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out one of the nice things
that I like is that to make it respond
[SPEAKER_02]: fast enough to be able to catch all of the
changes in water potential that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: occurring in a plant, which is where we'd
like to take Richard Tensiometer and move
[SPEAKER_02]: it into the stem instead of being purely
for the soil, is we had to give it a
[SPEAKER_02]: vascular system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to connect this cavity to the
outside world with vessels that would,
[SPEAKER_02]: as in plants, as in the xylem tissue,
transmit the stress, maintain the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're divided from the outside world
by membranes, by nanoporous membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once inside this device, fluid moves
extremely rapidly along these vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea of segmented xylem allowed
us to take, from our first prototypes,
[SPEAKER_02]: our first generation of these devices,
very long transients that wouldn't capture
[SPEAKER_02]: things that occurred in less than an hour
to having just few, just tens of second
[SPEAKER_02]: transients that allow us, we think,
to capture all diurnal and so on behavior
[SPEAKER_02]: of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do it across, bring the Richard
Tensiometry idea out towards 100 bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So across all the way to really desert
stresses in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have just moved this into
plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have trees growing in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, working in branch segments,
these are actually just in the last week
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually measure where we apply drying
stresses onto this branch segment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can watch what we've been calling in
the lab diurnals, although they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just tens of minutes long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're associated with, not with true
transpiration, but with imposed
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are hoping that this will allow us
in a process, in an embedding process here
[SPEAKER_02]: designed for a woody species that just
takes a few minutes to get real-time,
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term stress information on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as part of water relations research,
and eventually, as part of irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling, to close that feedback loop
with what is a very relevant way to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's actual stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just a zoom to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to resolve, on tens of bar
scale, we can resolve small fractions of
[SPEAKER_02]: one bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Changes in water potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, of course, for annual species may
be the more relevant scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few bars instead of tens of bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an example of actually bringing
one of these technologies to a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's coming to a leader in the world of
making electronics, sophisticated
[SPEAKER_02]: electronics compatible with life.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Rogers Group, which has now moved to
Northwestern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example of what I think I
pointed to the idea of an RFID chip or
[SPEAKER_02]: patch on every leaf of a field of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example of human
application of real integrated circuitry
[SPEAKER_02]: on a flexible adhesive patch that gives
you, in this case, electrophysiological
[SPEAKER_02]: data through the skin of the wearer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know of anybody moving this
into plants, but if, again, with the right
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiration from you, I'm sure it could
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving towards the field, bringing these
things from research questions to the
[SPEAKER_02]: field is certainly a place where there's
lots of expertise on campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have seen this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a work from the Erickson Group in
mechanical engineering, where they have
[SPEAKER_02]: turned a iPhone into a relatively
sophisticated sensor, diagnostic system
[SPEAKER_02]: for metabolic diseases and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is an example of engineering
all the way towards something you can hand
[SPEAKER_02]: off to a non-expert user and bring to the
field and do diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there's this type of idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you have the idea of a lab on an
iPod, or iLab on an iPhone, you can –
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no reason not to bring it to a
question about a biochemical question in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a very large, very strong
electrical engineering department.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of Edwin Kahn,
who is very much focused on this question
[SPEAKER_02]: of completely wireless, power-free
sensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those patches may not even need a
battery, as with the checkout counter or
[SPEAKER_02]: RFID.
[SPEAKER_02]: An RFID is just an antenna.
[SPEAKER_02]: It picks up the energy it needs to respond
to you just from the radiation you send at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this, again, is someone who – if
you have sensors already, and what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need is to have 10,000 of them that all
talk to you, there's that expertise on
[SPEAKER_02]: campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my longest section.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just give a few examples of imaging
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one of our imaging experts here,
Becky Williams.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a very good shared facility in
Weil and across in a biotech building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to highlight one of the things
I've – very exciting recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a collaboration of Matt Pachik
and Warren Zipveld.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're developing advanced versions of
the microscopy that I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a mammalian example,
but it's a super resolution technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're able – what we're seeing
here – it's hard to maybe read this scale
[SPEAKER_02]: bar – what we're seeing in the Z
direction, deformations of the cell's
[SPEAKER_02]: plasma membrane of tens of nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this cartoon – the bumps in this
micrograph are associated with individual
[SPEAKER_02]: or small clusters of transmembrane binding
proteins interacting with the substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is one of the things – this is
going from pure structure to dynamics in
[SPEAKER_02]: the current efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a huge possibility to watch
interactions at the plasma membrane one
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule, one transmembrane protein at a
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example that you may have heard
about recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uli Wiesner got a very large National
Institute of Health grant for this effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's – in this case, he's – the star of
this picture is this little sphere here,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can be just a few nanometers across
and carries with it the ability – can
[SPEAKER_02]: carry with it fluorescence and chemistry
that allow it to be a detector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, they're using it to carry
contrast agent for an imaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they've worked on this in many
different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little lab-on-a-particle is an
opportunity to have a truly dispersable
[SPEAKER_02]: sensor that could be – go to the tissue in
an intact plant, go to the tissue where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want it, and then be read out
spectroscopically, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: or by fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example – not from Cornell,
but from this field of so-called
[SPEAKER_02]: nanomaterials here from Michael Strano's
group at MIT of disrupting a chloroplast
[SPEAKER_02]: with a nanotube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he finds – a simple – my simple
understanding is essentially by putting
[SPEAKER_02]: this carbon nanotube, which is just a few
nanometers in diameter and has tunable
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical properties, he's essentially
putting an antenna into this organelle
[SPEAKER_02]: within the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And changing – and this is him piercing a
single chloroplast and getting a different
[SPEAKER_02]: – getting an infrared signal from that
chloroplast that was invisible before he
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go on in this paper to claim that
this is improved photosynthetic efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: in these leaves that were treated with – I
have some worry about that claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea, again, of having almost
molecular-scale engineered material that
[SPEAKER_02]: can be part of transducing information
from the cellular scale or even
[SPEAKER_02]: influencing the behavior at the cell and
subcellular scale I think is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, models – again, I'm going to – looking
towards models that I know there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of expertise in CALS and in plant science
in bioinformatic modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm less familiar with modeling of gene
expression coupled – the kinetics of gene
[SPEAKER_02]: expression coupled to signaling,
coupled to cellular behavior, coupled to
[SPEAKER_02]: transport processes on the organism scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one definition of systems
biology that I think is very relevant to
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, we – Mike Schuler, again – here I
gave him both his departments,
[SPEAKER_02]: biomedical engineering and chemical
engineering – is actually famous in this
[SPEAKER_02]: community as a very early developer of
complete treatments of cell behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, starting with microbes, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I mean by complete – in this
case, the definition of complete is that
[SPEAKER_02]: he has a set of differential equations
that are self-sustaining, alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: and respond to metabolic stimuli and so on
in a way that is reasonable, including
[SPEAKER_02]: gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, going from gene regulation,
gene expression through to metabolism,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are tractable – there are a large
number of tractable models for prokaryotes
[SPEAKER_02]: and eukaryotes to be worked with,
to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Varner in my department is somebody
who is one of the people who pushed this
[SPEAKER_02]: to extremes of completeness in terms of
the number of molecular players they're
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to put into such a model of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, going from gene expression,
signaling internally and with the external
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, moving to a multi-scale,
consideration of how a cell evolves in its
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, with signals coming from other
parts of the tissue and through
[SPEAKER_02]: vasculature, for example, other parts of
the organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll highlight an effort with Bob Turgeon
that I've been involved in on the
[SPEAKER_02]: questions of phloem loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's an example of where – focused
on the biochemistry associated with phloem
[SPEAKER_02]: loading and transport questions,
very detailed questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: plasmadesmital – the physics of
plasmadesmata and how they regulate what
[SPEAKER_02]: goes – what gets loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do this – we claim, and I believe
that we – understanding the implications,
[SPEAKER_02]: the design ideas that are represented by
plasmadesmata requires some accounting for
[SPEAKER_02]: the full organism scale coupling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That this is what – the concentrations,
water potentials that define transport
[SPEAKER_02]: very locally in the – at the
mesophyll-phloem interface in the leaf are
[SPEAKER_02]: coupled throughout the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that, again, is an example of where
different levels of what could be defined
[SPEAKER_02]: as a systems biological approach can lead
to hypotheses that then lead to
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a useful – iterative process that
I think is not done enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just – here I can share these slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of other people across
the university that – most of whom have
[SPEAKER_02]: not thought to apply their skills to plant
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a number of them would be
happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, again, lots of resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: I – this talk was originally a co-talk
with the Center for Nanoscale Physics –
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanoscale Science and Technology,
the CNF.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd also point to the – and I believe
they're represented here – the Center for
[SPEAKER_02]: Material Science, which is, like the CNF,
an extremely robust, long, long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: effort, which in particular, for example,
has some of the best microscopists in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world and the absolute best TEM facilities
that can be had in academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually Lina is – recently
arrived and recently acquired a three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four-million-dollar transmission electron
microscope and is very interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: biological questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to summarize, there are opportunities
that go from the very most basic molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: biology through to something that will be
coupled to something strapped to a
[SPEAKER_02]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that – as I said, there's – it'd
be very nice to see the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions, vigorous interactions that
have been going on between engineers and
[SPEAKER_02]: human health biologists, going on between
engineers and plant biologists,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there are any decision makers in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that helped a whole lot
early on were seed grants, that we had no
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborations with Weill Cornell Medical
School.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there started to just sprinkle on
these 50K seed grants once a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was amazing how quickly that
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, biomedical engineering
also grew a whole program, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's – there's reason for this kind of
interaction I think could lead to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'd like to thank my group,
a number of people, a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators, including those here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bob I have not gotten you on my
collaborator list yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get those papers out,
but that wasn't because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for your attention,
and I'll be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few sensors in plants for
redox potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's encodable, encodable sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not always that easy to read
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think Becky and Warren over –
what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt over in – are working on ways to
read those sensors, which are finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, always the more focus we
get for a sensor, the better, and working
[SPEAKER_02]: out tricks to calibrate them and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
If you can grow your sensor in your plant,
express it in the plant, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there are physical size
exclusion steps that the animal cells that
[SPEAKER_02]: line the vessels actively endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Components that, at least in the context
of xyle, do not make it into the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not make it into the site at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be size excluded by millipedes,
for example, and challenged.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be size excluded from entering
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would be – but what that
dimension is, is not, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: is somewhat species dependent and not
always characterized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think some of these nanomaterials
are small enough to be taken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you know better about uptake or
articulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a given.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't just use a hypermeridium to
go into xyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will stop working.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned kind of the different
scales of plant versus mammalian trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like a small corn breeding trial
might be 10,000 plants, which would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely massive trial on rats,
much less humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, what are kind of, in terms of
these technologies in mammalian systems
[SPEAKER_00]: for tissue sensing, what are the largest
scales that people work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how could that be modified for the
scales that, you know, someone would be
[SPEAKER_00]: eating, like the cereals might be looking
at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so there are two – so if you – given
the budgets I hear of the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: programs, you could get people interested
enough to make enough sensors that their
[SPEAKER_02]: cost would go very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I could make enough of my xyle
sensors to satisfy breeders, if they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: way to use them, I could bring the cost of
that sensor down to very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it benefits from the scaling of
price that microelectronics benefits from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a real – you carry a super
computer in your pocket for a few hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is present.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other perspective is that some of
these approaches around so-called
[SPEAKER_02]: nanomaterials, these can be synthesized on
the many-gram scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they can be – if the delivery can
be worked out, that can – and there's –
[SPEAKER_02]: one reader is trapped with – one tracker
might be able to read all the plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to paint every leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you must be doing something like some
such human interaction with every one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those 10,000 species right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't – if I had it, I would do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the 10,000 replicas of an experiment
out in the field is a challenge,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a good one, is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping – I'm trying to articulate
that to this community and to the
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering community, and hopefully to
the funding community, that there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: an investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think it's – there's no
reason it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what does the engineer really need
from the plant biologist?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just your dream of what to
measure, but what is it to come to a
[SPEAKER_02]: compromise between what would be the
perfect piece of information and what
[SPEAKER_02]: would be scaled to 10,000 replicas at a
reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so – and my feeling is that the
readers are quite – they don't – they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't – and this is the gene to treat
gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so focused on the gene
identification that they're not worried
[SPEAKER_02]: much about what the research might be good
at – they could get beyond the dangle and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like being able to tap into the
phone and sense small optical signal
[SPEAKER_03]: through the phone would be a game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I – once we've explored some of these
in the CNF, for example, I've tried to –
[SPEAKER_02]: so did the proboscis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proboscis of a phone feeding insect
can be able to go through without inducing
[SPEAKER_02]: a clot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this ought to be replicatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been a huge effort on
micro-needle drug delivery for human
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's extremely fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's likely a pulled pipette,
but it's replicated many times over,
[SPEAKER_02]: including the chemistry on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I – that – yes, I think there is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: To – and I think the – looking to the
biology – so I think also species like
[SPEAKER_02]: mistletoe that grows itself into tissue
without disrupting tissue – the
[SPEAKER_02]: biochemistry that allows it to do that
gracefully – the suppressions of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: response – those are – those are part of
it, I think, of what's going to have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed for a graceful interface like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's – yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you – I mean, you focused a lot on
mechanical properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, plants are engaged in a lot of
exotic chemistry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about sort of
technologies that might be used to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: make sense of discovering all the
compounds or something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I – and so, for example – and in
the examples I've shown, much of the focus
[SPEAKER_02]: has been – well, also is on bio-molecules
– macro-molecules and small molecules in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of analysis on – with small samples
on small scales and cheap devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a big part of what the so-called
lab-on-a-chip effort has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it's the volatiles around
the plant or small molecule signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: within tissues, it's a good target.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one that bio-molecule has been
focusing on, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: expertise on canvas in that – in that
analytical chemistry scale down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to say that I think that Abe
has given us a number of really excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: illustrative examples of what can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as some really stimulating ideas
of opportunities where I think our
[SPEAKER_03]: community has to, you know, maybe do some
more thinking about how we can address
[SPEAKER_03]: some real breakthrough new advances by
bringing together our problems with,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a sense, Abe's tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before thanking you, don't forget that
we'll have a session now in the hall where
[SPEAKER_03]: we can continue discussion with Abe and
also with others from these other
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be great to have him
volunteer to come do the reciprocal talk
[SPEAKER_02]: in engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or volunteer to somebody who doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think he could – because,
again, they talk to students and all –
[SPEAKER_02]: they've heard about the biomedical
challenges, they've heard about tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering, they've heard about cancer,
and they know less about problems from
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and plant science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it would be great to do the
reciprocal talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
