[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Rebecca Benner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the science and strategy director for
the Nature Conservancy of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really exciting to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took my time thinking all the right
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run out of my five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consider yourself thanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nature Conservancy is a global
conservation nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work in all 50 states across the
country and 72 countries across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our global program, as Dave mentioned,
has been working in agriculture for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time in a number of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're really thinking a lot more
about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually stole that tagline rethink
soil from our global team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Nature Conservancy in general is
thinking a lot about this nexus between
[SPEAKER_00]: food, water, and climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that the Nature Conservancy in
New York, we're actually somewhat new to
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about this and to working with
all of you in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really excited to be here today
to learn from you and to understand how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can contribute to this ongoing dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell you a little bit
about the stuff that we do in New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it relates to soils, hoping that as we
continue this dialogue, we learn how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can add value to these conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell you a little bit
about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might say, why is she talking about
water when this is about soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly that's because Dave told me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other reason is because we've been
working around water for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think there's a beautiful nexus
with soil health and water health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you a little bit some
of the science that we've brought to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table around water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say that these maps,
though they're very pretty, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the story behind them, it's a little bit
disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map that is done based on the
Sparrow model from USGS by one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists at the Nature Conservancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's really trying to do is it's
a modeling exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to understand that if we had a
proposed standard around water quality in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, which the state did propose a
while ago, where would we be in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting that standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker the purple, the further away
from that standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're looking at
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darkest purple would be greater than
five times above the standard in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen concentrations that we would
want in our waterways to have healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only places that actually would meet
the standard would be the Adirondacks and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Catskills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colorful map in the lower left,
that's trying to tell you what those
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of nitrogen are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That beautiful blue is actually
atmospheric deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a huge amount of atmospheric
deposition of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, the orange is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is indoors and more relevant to
the conversations we're having today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar story around phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the darker greens are probably more
above in terms of the concentrations above
[SPEAKER_00]: the proposed standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in the lower left, you see the
colorful map that tells you sort of where
[SPEAKER_00]: those contributions are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here you can see the yellow really
driving most of that picture other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is really, it's manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, the orange is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this tells a story about our
waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us a little bit about what's
happening with nutrients in our waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Nature Conservancy, we feel this is
all of our issue and the community's
[SPEAKER_00]: issues to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all benefit from having cleaner water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need clean water to have production of
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is one of the most important food
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to continue to play in
that sphere with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody already mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York's important in the agricultural
sphere will only increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together, we need to start thinking
about our waters and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I come to soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Nature Conservancy, as I said,
is really thinking about this nexus
[SPEAKER_00]: between soil, water, and climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, we have been working a lot on
climate mitigation, particularly trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the state to achieve our very
ambitious renewable energy targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're actually turning for
thinking about how does nature play a role
[SPEAKER_00]: in sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, as the Nature Conservancy,
we've been thinking a lot about forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect you'll hear more of this
from our colleagues at Cornell a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit later today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually starting to think a little
bit about how does changing in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural practices actually helps to
sequester and store carbon, similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the things Dave talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Nature Conservancy's soil health
program really focuses on cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop rotation, and reduced tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of many national partnerships,
including the Soil Health Partnership,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a partnership created by the
Natural Corn Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are collecting data off of farms
all across the country to try to better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the benefits of soil health
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also think a lot about how does that
relate to nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are incredibly excited to be a partner
in the 4R program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 4R nutrient stewardship table
right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with NYSAABA and the Fertilizer
Institute, thinking about how do we work
[SPEAKER_00]: with nutrient applications to actually do
better nutrient management on our farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this then link to carbon
storage and the ability of nature to help
[SPEAKER_00]: us fight against global climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the nexus that we hope to
actually add value and bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of expertise on science,
a lot on water, a lot on climate
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to be part of this
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope and we are learning from all
of you about how food, water, climate all
[SPEAKER_00]: comes together in our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

Thank you.
Thank you.
