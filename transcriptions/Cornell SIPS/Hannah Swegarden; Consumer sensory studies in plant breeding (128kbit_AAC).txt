[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, I guess, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Hannah Swaygarden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually a PhD student in the section
of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am minoring in plant breeding
and food science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to come here today to kind of
talk to you about a small little project
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, well, not really so small anymore,
but involves trying to connect consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that an imperative part of
this project was that I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate and talk to plant breeders as
well, which is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a little bit of background,
I work in a diversified vegetable breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program that's based out of Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Dr. Philip Griffiths,
who works with several different crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: including snap beans, dry beans,
small fruited tomatoes, and many cole
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, including cabbage and broccoli,
cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as of recently, we've kind of
been focusing a lot on the leafy brassica
[SPEAKER_00]: types, which include kale and collard
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just kind of give you an example of
the diversity we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of taken some of the existing
morphologies and the leafy brassica types,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include kind of like a collard or a
Tuscan kale or a deep curly kind of kale,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really worked on developing and
enhancing the aesthetics of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different leafy types, which includes the
leaf shape, the leaf colors, and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as of right now, we've got an
immense amount of diversity that,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frankly, we don't really know what
to do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of where we sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, we've kind of taken and
integrated approach since I started almost
[SPEAKER_00]: two years ago now with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working to make connections
with New York City by performing chef's
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with green markets and some
of the farmers markets down in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We engage with lots of seed industry
partners, trying to get feedback,
[SPEAKER_00]: having them come out to our field days and
communicating with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as of the summer, we'll begin
some of our on-farm trialing with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these new diversified leafy brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as such, I think we get a really
good perspective of kind of who we might
[SPEAKER_00]: be interacting with across the food system
in our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first started in fall of 2015,
I attended a lecture by New York Times
[SPEAKER_00]: journalist Amy Harmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that lecture, she made a call
for scientists to engage with the public
[SPEAKER_00]: in a more empathetic discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure she was referring to the STEM
community at large, but as a horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeder, I kind of went through some
self-reflection and really tried to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about how I was engaging with the public
and how our program specifically was
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, I realized that there was
really one group that we don't directly
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with all that often, and that is
in fact the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: While inherently I think we understand as
breeders that our products end up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace and are consumed in some
capacity, we're not always directly
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I'm not entirely sure
is that we view the volatility of consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback in markets too crazy to really
kind of wrap into something that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate into our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that we don't really know what
consumers, or we think that we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what consumers want, or consumers don't
really know what they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we view this interaction with consumers
as too time consuming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we not have the time for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there language or translation barriers
between plant breeders and consumers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there just a lack of established
methodology that can be used to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: these two players in the food system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, as I said, I don't really have
the answer, I got thinking that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if it is in fact this last one that
we don't have established methodology,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can we find them and how can we
begin to explore how to connect these two
[SPEAKER_00]: groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer kind of came to me during a
product development class that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in food science around the same
time I attended this Amy Harmon seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this product development class
we talked about the typical food product
[SPEAKER_00]: development pipeline, where it's this
really, this kind of semi-linear product
[SPEAKER_00]: development scheme where it starts off
with exploratory ideas and concept
[SPEAKER_00]: developments, goes through a lot of
qualitative and quantitative iterations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then involves lots of different
feedback from downstream players,
[SPEAKER_00]: including processors and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have this really iterative
complex kind of interaction that somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to a prototype and eventually
scaling up and release of a new food
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw a lot of parallels between this
food product development pipeline and a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding pipeline as well,
that we kind of go through that same
[SPEAKER_00]: exploratory trait concept identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our population development,
prototype development, and then eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: get into some of the early testing,
advanced testing, and eventually hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought that if we could see some
parallels between the food product
[SPEAKER_00]: development pipeline and the plant
breeding pipeline, maybe we can use some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those tactics and those methods that
they use in the food product development
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline as a means of connecting with
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I connected with the sensory
evaluation center in the food science
[SPEAKER_00]: department to begin exploring established
sensory analysis and consumer marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques that are used commonly
throughout the food industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I began connecting with the
sensory evaluation center, we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually perform a case study using an
established plant breeding program,
[SPEAKER_00]: notably mine, that we are in to see if
there was any methodology that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: use on a more regular basis to connect
with consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the methods that we settled on
to begin exploring was called qualitative
[SPEAKER_00]: multivariate analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a well-established product
development tool that involves eight
[SPEAKER_00]: different steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really just designed to expose the
consumer and participants to the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're interested in a really
intimate setting so that they become very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with the product and can describe
it beyond just sensory modalities or kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of initial marketing perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get a really in-depth look at the
product that you're trying to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through the use of this qualitative
multivariate analysis, also known as QMA,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're hoping to do is understand the
importance of different plant traits
[SPEAKER_00]: through the consumer lens and kind of
begin to create a trait hierarchy of
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understand what type of
information we could draw from consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: that would not only be feasible to obtain
for a plant breeder, but also applicable
[SPEAKER_00]: to a plant breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then evaluate QMA as a methodology in
and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a methodology that plant breeders
would want to use on a semi-regular basis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly and probably the best
part about this method was that it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: used broad strokes to talk to consumers
and as such really provided a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to generate further hypotheses
that we could use in our breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: to connect with consumers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was the platform that we used
initially to begin exploring the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between plant breeders and
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get going, we decided to use the
model crop of kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard, it's a little trendy
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I didn't pick it just because
it's kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kale in and of itself picked it more
because it has popularity and is such
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer familiarity and just provides a
platform for conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily just about the
kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to think a little bit beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had also the diversity of a product
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could go into our breeding program
and pick out six different lines to give
[SPEAKER_00]: to consumers that represented a diversity
in the kale product category, I guess you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the six different types we looked at
were collard type, Tuscan kale,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our yellowish kind of breeding
lines, a Portuguese truncuta type with
[SPEAKER_00]: thick midribs, a classic deep curl kale
and then kind of a fizz Siberian kale as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we had that product set
identified, we decided to bring on board
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 self-identified kale enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just means that they were familiar
with kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prepared it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were also creative and
articulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really imperative in this
discussion because these participants were
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing home these six different leaf
types, trying them out, consuming them and
[SPEAKER_00]: journaling about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed them to come back and be
able to provide feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't really tap into a consumer
base that didn't like kale in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place for this methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we had our product set and our
participants identified, we sent them home
[SPEAKER_00]: with these six different leaf types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of two weeks,
the consumers prepared these leaf types
[SPEAKER_00]: however they liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were required to just
journal about their experiences and
[SPEAKER_00]: document their experiences through a photo
journal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that two weeks, we brought
all the consumers back in for a
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitated focus group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a pretty intense three-hour
session in which we picked apart every
[SPEAKER_00]: emotion you could probably have regarding
kale purchasing and consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But throughout that, as I said,
we picked apart associated emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed a lexicon and did lexicon
exercises to kind of identify what words
[SPEAKER_00]: and descriptors consumers were using to
describe kale sensory modalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we picked apart contextual
associations, so different leaf types
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with different culinary
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also performed projective mapping
exercises, which essentially just allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: the participants to identify axes of
importance and then place those different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties along those axes in order to
identify relationships among those
[SPEAKER_00]: different leaf types.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the information that we took out
of this facilitated focus group was used
[SPEAKER_00]: to build a value diagram, a trait
hierarchy, and then an online Kano survey,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll talk about in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, walking out of this focus group,
we ended up with a lot of qualitative
[SPEAKER_00]: information, which was kind of new
territory for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot more value-oriented and value
descriptors and emotions that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some preliminary results that we got
was that there was a preconceived iconic
[SPEAKER_00]: kale that was already defined in the
consumer's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of this leafy,
curly kale type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was kind of the current market
class that we were confined to when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were discussing kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to push the consumer definition
of a market class and the boundaries of
[SPEAKER_00]: what a consumer is calling kale might be
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we need to
consider when we go about marketing or
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some of our diversity in our
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers also emphasized the importance
of what we call freshness indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So had to have good storability,
which differentiates kale from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture was extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kale also needed to retain its
shape and form throughout cooking and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think perhaps one of the biggest things
that we got out of this was that texture
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the most important sensory
perceptions and sensory modalities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our breeding program had not focused
on texture in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we're inherently focused on
aesthetics, which was the color and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so moving forward, we need to be sure
to identify and we need to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: different texture traits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I said, we also got a lot of
value information from the participants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strong association with health,
well-being, and community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can do with all this
information, and this is a bit of a busy
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, is begin to really identify a value
diagram and kind of understand how what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do as plant breeders affects larger core
values at the consumer level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might adjust a texture component,
whether that be the fibrousness of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do so, that must also translate
throughout the consumer's interaction with
[SPEAKER_00]: this kale type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is important to keep this in
mind and important to inherently
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that we can very much,
by making a minute and semi-small change
[SPEAKER_00]: to a leaf type effect, the ultimate
identity and identification of this
[SPEAKER_00]: product with a consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward, I would say that QMA
was really successful in doing what Amy
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmon called for, which was to create an
empathetic discussion with consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that it was necessarily the
easiest methodology for a plant breeder to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to explore other
methodologies too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a start, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I'm going to continue to work
with the sensory evaluation center.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, QMA was a hypothesis generating
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot more to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to validate a lot of what
we saw in the focus group with an online
[SPEAKER_00]: survey, validate it in-house over in the
food sensory evaluation center,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop lab protocols to measure texture
quantitatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also in the process of forming a
descriptive panel that we can go to with
[SPEAKER_00]: our breeding lines to really evaluate some
of these sensory modalities on a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also in the process of
developing a consumer kale sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptor wheel, which will be really
interesting to run through our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this in the hopes of continuing to
support an integrative plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program and really getting one step closer
to connecting plant breeders and consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I just want to thank Alina and
my advisor Phil Griffiths for all their
[SPEAKER_00]: support throughout this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to take any questions that
you might have or talk to you after,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a quantitative way to measure
texture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a summer scholar that will be
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is hopefully what she will be
working on in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptive panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can set up a descriptive panel who
will be really trained in identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: different textural properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can rate leafy type from the
texture of a peanut brittle to peanut
[SPEAKER_00]: butter, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to validate that in the lab
using a pentrometer or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're going to try to
work on and see what the best protocols
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have done this if we had a
panel that didn't like kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have gotten any information
out of them, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was fundamental that we had to have
a group of panelists that liked and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed kale in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's the ultimate goal,
is to address the population that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the future, when we introduce
new products, we will have already have
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensory modalities identified and
described for those different leaf types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we give it to them, we can
identify what has changed about those leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: types and if that affects the perception
from the people who don't like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask one more question?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a consumer in my garden that
likes to take a broccoli in cone butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're medieval.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will eat them because they're
like vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll take a seedling of broccoli in
cone butter and they'll eat the kale,
[SPEAKER_01]: which does something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there something about the leaf
texture or secondary?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as I know, the secondary
metabolites are relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the same species as cabbage
and broccoli and cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the animal you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: A medieval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start a medieval descriptive panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
