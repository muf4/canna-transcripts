[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to talk today, run through
fairly quickly a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The introduction said I've investigated
numerous angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to see a little bit of
a lot of different angles in this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So broccoli production in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm betraying my California
upbringing in pursuing this topic at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out to be a really
interesting one with a lot of potential in
[SPEAKER_02]: various different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would one care about broccoli
production in the Northeast?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a number of different things
happening right now that kind of makes
[SPEAKER_02]: this a compelling thing to pursue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you're all aware that locally
grown is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's talking about locally grown
produce as being something attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is showing up in the marketplace
as the supermarkets and wholesalers are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to think about how can I get
local product into my store?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can I source it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can I buy it from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the lower diesel prices this year,
for the past several years, diesel has
[SPEAKER_02]: been very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's made transportation from California
very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the wholesale price of broccoli
and much other produce on the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: half of that cost is the transportation
and half of it is the cost that was paid
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cost has not come down with the
diesel price, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the same high price.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a barrier that provides an
opportunity to make money for growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at reducing the carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shipping 10,000 pounds of broccoli and
10,000 pounds of ice across the country
[SPEAKER_02]: has a substantial footprint, not only with
the diesel, but the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can reduce that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our vegetable growers value
diversification on their farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: value diversification on what they're
selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both in the rotation and economically,
diversification is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, as we've noticed with the
shortage of water in California this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: that having our production diversified
around the country can help provide,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're calling it food security for the
United States, that we don't fall short of
[SPEAKER_02]: crops that we really like during periods
when the one location that it's grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: something's happening there that prevents
us from getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a number of angles to why we
would want to be looking at broccoli in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Northeast right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why broccoli?
[SPEAKER_02]: People love broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who ate broccoli in the last month?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the last week?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've probably got some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody eats broccoli just about,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very popular crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this chart shows how the broccoli
consumption per capita has been going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the population's going up,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing to me is down here
at 1970, we're about half a pound per
[SPEAKER_02]: person a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an Italian specialty vegetable
pretty much in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really only became sort of something
everybody ate relatively recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a big upside for kale,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a half now.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the burst in the last few years,
it's gone from a quarter to a half,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's really gone way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can imagine the trajectory over
the next several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's only upside potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do we grow broccoli now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we grow it in California,
of course, is the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this shows you the big numbers are how
many acres of production there are in each
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see on the coast in the summer,
in the desert, in the wintertime,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little smattering on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get to the very northernmost
county where it's good and cold,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little patch there and a little
winter production down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, it's a little smattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, I think we have worked with
each of the farms that represents a dot in
[SPEAKER_02]: this map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's potential for increasing that
on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why can't we do that simply?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, the varieties that
exist are poorly adapted to our eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature, water, humidity, and
variability and all of the above are
[SPEAKER_02]: really big challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's been done to date is to
raise broccoli where the conditions are
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as demand goes up, we need to find
more places.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other significant obstacle is that for
any one location, we have a relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: short harvest season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here would basically be September right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow broccoli just fine if you
harvest in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is that your customers need
broccoli 12 months out of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not going to abandon their
reliable supplier for a month to take your
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the growers dilemma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So supplying year round turns out to be a
very important element of getting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that situation,
the distribution network for growers
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the East is not really set up
to handle a fresh market product with this
[SPEAKER_02]: volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just getting it from the producers to
the stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very common question from farmers,
I can grow it just fine, but who do I sell
[SPEAKER_02]: it to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very common question from retail produce
buyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want local broccoli,
but we can't find anybody to raise it for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this seems like a dilemma that can be
overcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out this distribution network
is the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do we start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, start with breeding and
improving the crop, because that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're really good at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk in more detail about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But breeding a better crop doesn't help
unless the farmers can buy the seed of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the rubber meets the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's only 6,000 acres of broccoli in
the East, the seed companies don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to spend money on
developing varieties, marketing them,
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing them, raising seed, and selling
those seed if there's only a few growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they haven't been motivated to do
anything at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a big obstacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've tried to put together a project
where we can tempt them with the promise
[SPEAKER_02]: of having a lot more acreage in the East
so it's worth their while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this promise of volume markets has
developed the promise of potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: having a lot more Eastern growers,
more seed sales, and seed company
[SPEAKER_02]: interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just to show you what the problem
looks like, with warm nights, not enough
[SPEAKER_02]: chilling hours to put it, roughly for
those of you who've taken plant physiology
[SPEAKER_02]: and recognize that system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flower buds need cool temperatures
to decide to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, that didn't happen at the
right time in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have some very teeny tiny
floral primordia there and some big flower
[SPEAKER_02]: buds there that managed to squeak through
while it was still cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what a Western adapted variety
looks like here in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a variety that was bred for
growing in warmer summer conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably nobody would buy this unless it
was a friend who was selling it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Pacman.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the variety that Eastern broccoli
production was based on for about 20 years
[SPEAKER_02]: until maybe five or 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still looks pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sell that in some markets,
but certainly not in the supermarket trade
[SPEAKER_02]: or the restaurant trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have varieties that look
better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the physiological goal and the
breeding goal of the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to run through really quickly
some of the physiology we did a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in case you've forgotten or are
not yet aware, because we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: picking up on this soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in development, you have vegetative
meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You recognize a little dome on top there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a certain point, the flowering
reproductive transition comes along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you have a reproductive
meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main difference is this one's about
twice as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little flat spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there, where it's starting to
develop a reproductive meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, little whorls of reproductive
meristems are being produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of the new knobs is another
reproductive meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see little bracts coming up at the
base of some of the whorls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the rightmost figure,
you see that there's a little ring around
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are now floral primordia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little things at the edges are sepal
primordia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're starting to differentiate into
flowers, which means they're not making
[SPEAKER_02]: more meristems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This just keeps going and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it doesn't get enough chilling hours
during this period, that's when the
[SPEAKER_02]: transition to these little floral
meristems doesn't quite happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an inflorescence meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's green, but it looks like cauliflower,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the floral primordia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to show you, you can get a good-sized
head consisting of nothing but floral
[SPEAKER_02]: primordia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arrested in development.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inset shows them a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gone all the way to flower buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may ask, what's the genetic
difference between these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we had the gene, we could solve
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all three of those pictures are
taken from exactly the same genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an F1 hybrid commercial green
cauliflower variety called Green Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's widely raised in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So its gene expression is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: What triggers gene expression after a
certain number of chilling hours are
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll take a quick look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leafy is a gene that usually,
if it turns on, that's when you start
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the floral differentiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you can see a vegetative
meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the white speckles are where the gene
is being expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's low in the vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to get higher right in the
outside surface of those reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: meristems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it goes to flower buds,
it actually looks a little bit lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: which stays high at that point in
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Denise Duclos, a graduate student here,
who looked at a whole set of candidate
[SPEAKER_02]: genes that we believed from Arabidopsis
work, would tell us where the level of
[SPEAKER_02]: control was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found many genes that didn't do
anything interesting at all, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: we expected them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leafy, when the transition from the
floral primordia to the flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leafy drops off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have the earlier transition,
we see that the apetala1, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: petal designating gene, turns on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a couple of transitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, what leads up to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we compared as development proceeds
or the expression levels of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see leafy stops at this one and ap1
turns off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another one called fruitful that
was doing some interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to go to the next step, we're asking
what regulates these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you compare broccoli with what's
going on in Arabidopsis, we were not
[SPEAKER_02]: encouraged to say, well, it happens this
way in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore it must be happening the same
way in broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not being expressed at the
same stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very complex network that leads
up to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up having a very large number
of candidate genes to try to pursue a
[SPEAKER_02]: candidate gene approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that effort more or less stopped at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And given the situation that we're in,
the next step is really to pick it up at
[SPEAKER_02]: the genomics level where you can look at
all of the genes you don't have to know in
[SPEAKER_02]: advance and look at what that variation
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a direction that Zach Stansel
will be pursuing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went to grad review, you saw some
of the populations that he has available
[SPEAKER_02]: to him to begin that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be continuing onward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we come to the Eastern Broccoli
Project, which funded no molecular work
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever, but many other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a project that was funded by
the Specialty Crops Research Initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a goal of having year-round
broccoli production of a quality that
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here are the harvest seasons
starting in Maine, New York going south.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the mountains of Tennessee,
Kentucky, and Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: South Carolina, North Carolina,
and then South Georgia and Florida are
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the different production areas
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the harvest season in each of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things you can see is that
there is gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when we've got all the production
areas going, there are still gaps in the
[SPEAKER_02]: production season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the goal is to expand each of those
production seasons by increasing the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental adaptation of the broccoli
so that we can go wider and have them
[SPEAKER_02]: overlap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to find the year-round
production, we need not only the varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: that have the right traits, we need the
really wide adaptability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a trait of sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really a fundamental behavior of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get the varieties released.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed companies need to be producing
the seeds, selling the seeds of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a grower base that can expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people who are expert at growing
vegetables but not currently doing
[SPEAKER_02]: broccoli, how can they start doing
broccoli?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does that make sense for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at the supply so that we're
having enough broccoli coming on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market to meet the demand, but not so much
that it depresses the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finding that balance is actually not
only challenging, but very location
[SPEAKER_02]: specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tank the price in one market and
have a shortage in another one just a few
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally make sure that the
product that's raised in the East is
[SPEAKER_02]: valued by the consumers and by the produce
managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a real roadblock in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set up a set of six objectives in
the project to try to hit all of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk a little bit about most of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you may not even be able to read
that, but this is some of the team that
[SPEAKER_02]: was working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had a breeding group,
nutritional quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to have the broccoli be less
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big regional trial system in many
locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking at economics, both
national market systems and consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: decision making.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a team from the seed companies who
are responsible for commercialization,
[SPEAKER_02]: a number of different farms, an extension
team to make sure that the growers had
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate guidance, and then a bunch of
distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out it's not like this one big
flow of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hundreds of different markets all
with their own expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to represent a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of integration with industry
in this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the breeding element of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to improve the public sector
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the public sector, there's a lot of
opportunity to make improvements that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't make sense for the companies,
especially bringing in more unusual traits
[SPEAKER_02]: or starting with material that's a little
bit more odd than commercial material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also want to discover the best seed
company germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got lots of packets of seeds
stashed away that didn't have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: market potential before, but maybe it does
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to combine the excellent traits
that are in the commercial germplasm with
[SPEAKER_02]: the new traits that would come out of a
public program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to understand the quantitative
genetics of the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are difficult traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understanding how they behave and
interact is important for making progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicking trials for hybrid production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all couples are made in heaven when it
comes to broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of them are very productive of
seed, some are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a seed company, seeds are your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a hybrid that you want to
sell on the plant that just doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of seeds, well, that's low
productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turns out that the hybrids you see
on the market are from very fecund
[SPEAKER_02]: parental pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three public programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Griff is one of them here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mark Farnham with ARS at Charleston,
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jim Meyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Oregon State who's been
breeding for really the processing
[SPEAKER_02]: industry as well as for organic
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to bring that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three private programs,
the seed companies, Bayo, Syngenta,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Seminus were the ones who elected to
join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the person trying to get all these
people to talk to each other in common
[SPEAKER_02]: language, we find that each of the
breeding programs has a very distinct way
[SPEAKER_02]: of going about things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different populations, different goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the techniques was to try to
encourage them to compete a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a regional trial program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to make sure that everybody
feels the competitive urge to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: best material in the regional trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: That proved helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at the same time, we want them to
collaborate with each other to generate
[SPEAKER_02]: cross program results that are even
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we really want to get the public
material licensed so that growers can get
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing is how it's done these days by
having the public material then go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company in one of many forms and
become available and provide revenue to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep these breeding programs going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are the breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are the traits that the new
varieties need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you notice it's a long list for
starters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll only mention briefly, we need the
stability across environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wide adaptation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in any given location,
you're going to have a lot of variation in
[SPEAKER_02]: the weather and you don't know how to
predict it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember 365 days ago, what kind of
jacket were you wearing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you wearing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's normal variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the uniform beads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really genetically a chiller
requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a good dome on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just so the rain falls off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need that for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have a relatively flat head in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need one that sheds rain so it doesn't
rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure it has all the
ingredients that make it healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market likes really small flower buds
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really small flower buds are difficult
to hide uneven flower buds behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big ones hide stuff a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much do you need that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to look really green because
people buy broccoli because it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is healthier, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody works that way in their head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this turns out to be not just
chlorophyll content, but wax structure on
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface, what color anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot that goes into the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these are complex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a single gene trait in the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So figuring out how to pile all these
together is no small matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to really address the first one in
particular, we've set up a system of
[SPEAKER_02]: regional trials where we are testing the
material in very different locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to identify the white
adaptations to the east.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to collect a data set where we can
start to understand the genetic control of
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's huge environmental effect on
essentially all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a substantial genotype by
environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to figure out anything at all,
you need massive data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We particularly want to understand the
variation in nutritional quality because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, again, a feature people like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do see quite a lot of environmental
variation if you see the Beneforte
[SPEAKER_02]: broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being sold as a
glucoraphanin-enhanced broccoli type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't tell you what concentration
it is because it varies quite a lot with
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it contains four times as much as
normal broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's entirely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow a regular variety and
Beneforte next to each other, the
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneforte generally runs about four times
as high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the absolute number depends on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a lot of variation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to identify where different
germplasm has complementary traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get one with a great dome and one
that's really green, but you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting any that have both, for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want the companies to buy and
license the public sector material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these regional trials, they were set up
in three phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one, we allow lots and lots of
entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're essentially culling at that stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got five locations, two plantings at
each location, so lots of observations on
[SPEAKER_02]: those, but not a huge investment in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an effective culling step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we can attract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything a breeder thinks might look
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs a chance to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a much more elaborate
stability trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have five plantings at four
locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that way we try many different times
during the season and really get a sense
[SPEAKER_02]: of how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get vast variation in what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to hit a stressful time and a
non-stressful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes nature cooperates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also where we look at the
nutritional studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we go to looking at
commercial yields, where we're on grower
[SPEAKER_02]: farms, seeing how they actually behave.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of yield are they going to make
money?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does it cost to harvest them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to go in three times?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or seven times?
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a lot of time standardizing
across locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had little diagrams for how to score
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got together and made sure everybody
sat in the same room and looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: broccoli heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is this a three for green or a four
for green?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make sure that everybody was scoring
the same way at each location,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're trying to compare numbers
across locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that be standardized was really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the stuff that comes out of it,
just a little glimpse we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an association among the different
traits that we scored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so each of this are a scatter plot of
how the two traits are related to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example of firmness and bead
size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually smaller flower buds make the head
firmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is sturdier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that there's a very strong
positive relationship there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the firmness is actually
caused by the flower buds being small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plot uniformly is the plant to plant
variation is not at all associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: firmness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably wouldn't expect them to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you find some are completely unrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one, as I just implied,
small beaded ones, it's harder to hide
[SPEAKER_02]: non-uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'd expect a strong negative
correlation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The small beaded stuff tends to look less
uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, that's a negative
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way to look at that is,
hey, there's some here that have small
[SPEAKER_02]: beads and look uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So breeders are great at talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great at tossing out the junk and
looking at only the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what happens here,
is you keep the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in comparing the material over
these many sites, you have to really
[SPEAKER_02]: condense the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we ended up using spider plots as one
way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of the axes is a different trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're grouped a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got firmness, bead size,
bead uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the first three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are important traits that are
difficult to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dome is also important and sensitive
to heat a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then head uniformity, color, head
expression, how far it comes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: plot uniformity, and holding time,
which you can see is sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is grown in cool conditions,
red in hot conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So green magic is, when we started,
was the most common variety in the East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marathon was the most common variety in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that it goes down to horrible
low numbers when it's warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironman was being sold for being tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red line is a lot smaller than the
green line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Castle dome was another standard we looked
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was from the second year breeding
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some that are fair in the heat
sensitive traits, but really do very
[SPEAKER_02]: nicely in everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others that have really quite high numbers
in the heat sensitive traits and are not
[SPEAKER_02]: too bad in the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to look over the different
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so skipping several years ahead now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the slide that I'm actually
very excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how fast is the breeding progress when
you're working with very complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're working with talented
breeders who know the art of breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: progress is fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on our rating system, a three was
generally set at where the minimum
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial quality is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a three, you can probably sell
it if everything else is OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And four was considered really good
commercial quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to five because some of the traits
go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here I put the axis at three
because it's the minimum and the top at
[SPEAKER_02]: four because that's what we ultimately
want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these bars is the average of 120
data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're pretty strong as far as
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red lines are the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same varieties every time,
five different standards that are averaged
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green are the five best lines in
our phase one trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started, this was material that
people had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it might be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best of those, you see that they're
a little bit improved in the uniform bead,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit smoother dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dome stays OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a little bit greener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three years of breeding later,
now the uniform bead is well into the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial range.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dome is still well into the commercial
range here on smoothness.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've maintained the dome, haven't given
up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're much greener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had remarkable progress here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's further crosses being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the anticipation is that this will
continue up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be able to go from barely
commercial to really well towards having
[SPEAKER_02]: everything hit commercial a lot of the
time is a tremendous advance on the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to do that is a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone from this in August to this in
August is what happens to be one of marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Griff has lines that also look like
this in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you can sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what seed companies are
interested in commercializing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the material that we started with here
in the early one, that is what has become
[SPEAKER_02]: released as commercial varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've been in the yield trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to show you graphically how the
yield trials were laid out with the
[SPEAKER_02]: different production areas on the x-axis
here in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the year on the x-axis, different
locations on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how you try to fit so that the growth
happens when it's warm enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's done and ready to harvest before
it gets either too hot or too cold,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on which end of the season
you're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to fit the different
locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see we go from very cold areas to
very warm areas to try to cover the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these yield trials have shown that the
new material is stable and superior in
[SPEAKER_02]: each in their own locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had six varieties released by the
seed companies in the first four years of
[SPEAKER_02]: the project and are expecting a couple
more to come out this growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on the early stuff, so the better
stuff is on the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in their pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that is a great result,
just thinking about in your own research,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the mechanism from getting it from
your lab to industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's for sale in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an awful lot of steps,
an awful lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seeing this much progress in four years
is really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the breeders and seed companies
in the project that have moved it along
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we come to the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the growers going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we fit the new varieties in
and look at where we can stretch the
[SPEAKER_02]: season a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where should we encourage new production?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the elements of looking at that
is to look at climate data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got tremendous resources in climate
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can look at some patterns to try to
guess where it might fit well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I first do sort of a rough picture
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using Salinas where the production is
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using as a proxy the mean minimum
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we actually use in the model is
number of days that the nighttime
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature exceeds 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's much harder to draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just the mean minimum temperature on
actually a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see it's Salinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blue here is where it's really too cold
for it to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red is where it's too warm for it to grow
or for it to produce nice heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the eastern location in Caribou,
Maine up there in the north, they have
[SPEAKER_02]: similarly cool middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they can produce it in the
middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But very different pattern there in the
continental climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Geneva, you see that we're
warmer than Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just touches that red zone in a
tantalizing sort of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Western New York is very productive for
coal crop production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of improvement and we can
probably do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about nearby areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an example, I'll use Fremont,
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the southern shore of Lake Erie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit further south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see they pop up into the
red area quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's actually quite a lot less
suitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to make pretty big changes in
the temperature tolerance of broccoli to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at the harvest season,
Salinas actually harvest from April
[SPEAKER_02]: through November and then they move down
to the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Maine, they actually start
harvesting in July and they go until early
[SPEAKER_02]: October whenever they get frozen out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that's quite a bit shorter
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got up here sort of my guess is what
the harvest season would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at New York, that slope is
steep, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's changing fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we know is that there's a lot of
variability in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what our harvest season can
look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that Fremont, Ohio is steeper
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not so much that they're warmer,
it's that they're steeper that makes it a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their season is quite a bit shorter
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other issue we deal with is rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this past June, do you remember June?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a deadly amount of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those roots are not breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to compare broccoli production
to dragster racing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you miss a shift in dragster racing,
you're out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing with broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a mis-shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't making the transition from newly
transplanted to rapid growth quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ends up being a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll get to see a little bit how
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking also at the growers,
how should they produce broccoli to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it profitable?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be more profitable than whatever
they're growing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need some hard numbers on that and
some production systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I noted is that with cabbage,
which is very similar to broccoli in many
[SPEAKER_02]: ways, we produce about 50 to 55 tons per
acre in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the southeast, on much lighter soils,
there are around 30 tons an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet both locations are producing
typically 400 to 450 boxes an acre,
[SPEAKER_02]: about half of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you monkeyed around with the growing
a little bit, could you move Western New
[SPEAKER_02]: York production a little bit closer to
California than it is in Georgia?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we tried some nutrition and
particularly plant population changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the traditional population here is
similar to other transplanted vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, maybe 14, 15, 16,000 plants per
acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going with some higher numbers
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the rows are 15 inches apart,
and every fourth row is skipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're either 6, 8, or 12 inches
apart in the row.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there are production systems
that will pack them even as tight as this
[SPEAKER_02]: 52,000 population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is two weeks after transplanting
what they should look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're filling in in the row for the most
part, except for the 12 inch one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks, you've got a pretty solid
stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, four and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about when the herbicide wears
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weed management is one of the big
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your herbicide wears off and the
weeds start germinating at this point,
[SPEAKER_02]: how big a problem are the weeds going to
be?
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically don't stand a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The broccoli roots fill the entire soil,
and there's no light coming to the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weed management really works out nice
if you have this kind of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 52 days is when harvest begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this one, you can see it's a little
bit lighter green because the nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_02]: moving towards the heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, a few little leaves that were
shaded out, they're moving the nitrogen up
[SPEAKER_02]: into the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing very high fertility
production, but not excessive fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen is being used effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens in terms of productivity
with these?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a graph of the cumulative
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the lowest population does exactly what
experience has been with low populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do three cuts and you've got a yield
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got about 550 because we're doing high
fertility there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we beat the state average on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the intermediate population,
there's about a five day delay in
[SPEAKER_02]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're giving up something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's more plants that produce
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're putting up the yield close to
700 on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were packed tighter,
then they started competing with each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though they were only delayed a
few more days, they start pooping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of plants that don't
make anything harvestable at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were too tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found that moving up into the 30s,
30,000 something is going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better than 15,000, which is where people
generally are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: With quality, I used a hollow stem here,
a hollow stem susceptible variety in this
[SPEAKER_02]: trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a delicious tasting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's popular for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically how thick the stem is
determines whether the pith is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you look at the head weight,
these are all five inch heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the heavier heads are the ones that
have thicker stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the dimension that's changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the low population, we're getting
big, thick stems with lots of hollow stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the highest population, we're getting
undersized heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to try to keep them close to 0.2
kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intermediate population not only
gave the highest yield, it gave the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this tells us what the optimal
population should look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so growers can find what their own is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, we're doing this to see when
you make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do the numbers on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 2013 was an excellent year for growing
broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green curve is the revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red curve is the total cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're figuring everything,
owning the tractors, the barns,
[SPEAKER_02]: interest payments, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not marginal cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's total cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: By way of comparison, good corn crop is
worth $600, $700.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very big money compared with
even some profitable crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the low population make pretty good
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intermediate population make even more
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014 was a challenging year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a hailstorm come through just
before heading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another missed shift, if you will,
where the plants really were shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stopped growing for several days just
from the physical shock of the hailstorm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had lower yields then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at those differences where
the profit is, that intermediate
[SPEAKER_02]: population still made good money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going with the lower population just
barely broke even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that one is higher than the
industry standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving those populations up is going to
make broccoli a lot more economically
[SPEAKER_02]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 2015, I showed you what 2015 looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a terrible, terrible year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens when you have a terrible
year with that huge investment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the costs are still high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the lower population, it still
pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out to be all bunching broccoli
instead of crowned broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the highest population lost money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the grower still doesn't lose a ton of
money even when there's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: disastrous event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you don't make much money,
but at least you have $6,000 an acre at
[SPEAKER_02]: risk there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So coming out even with that one is
actually pretty good news in a terrible
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to continue down the line of the
economic analysis for making that money,
[SPEAKER_02]: here's the price per box over the last
five years at Eastern Terminal Markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the prices vary all over the place
depending on who you're selling it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the terminal market price at least is
basically the same thing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're reported every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get the numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the blue line is a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green line is a crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market is more and more crown cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few holdouts that are still
doing bunches.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Southeast, which is very conservative
in their food tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City, which apparently is very
conservative in its food tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to draw that inference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And organic tends to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bulk of the market these days is
crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that there used to be a
differential between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the last few years, that's pretty
much gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The price jumps around a lot from year to
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a grower going into a spot
market like this, it can be very hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really important to make sure
that at $14, $15, you're making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you make a lot of money,
but you don't know when that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years there's a transition right
around New Year's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It often comes as they're switching over
production from Salinas to the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes there's a big extra supply
coming out of Mexico right around then
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're trying to catch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at the total production costs
for the East to see how they compare with
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at some models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers came in remarkably
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all like $11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put several dollars of error bars on
each of these because it depends so much
[SPEAKER_02]: locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these numbers are definitely
competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what goes into those varies a great
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost structure, so California water
costs a lot, here water comes down free,
[SPEAKER_02]: or sometimes too much, but it comes down
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land is very expensive in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land is not very expensive here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Labor is much more difficult to get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's significant differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the big variables, so I'll
remind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the price chart, $15 production
costs $11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where your potential
profit margin is.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big variables is the
post-harvest costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So broccoli is all really rapidly growing
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's respiring like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you take a bunch of broccoli
that's out in the sunshine, and you put it
[SPEAKER_02]: in a box, and you put a bunch of boxes
together, and they're all busy respiring
[SPEAKER_02]: at a very high temperature, what's going
to happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to burn up all their sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to get cold really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been a lot of work done on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cold means 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean 38 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: 38 degrees, rapid enough respiration to
cost a lot of quality from the farm to the
[SPEAKER_02]: buyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting it cold is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a number of different
technologies, and it depends on the scale
[SPEAKER_02]: that the grower is working at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the most common is hydro
cooling, where you basically dip it into
[SPEAKER_02]: ice cold water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a conveyor belt that takes the
box, takes it down into the ice cold
[SPEAKER_02]: water, and up it comes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really very simple, straightforward,
not very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have access to gigantic blocks
of ice at a low cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got that, that's pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One that lasts a lot longer is this liquid
ice injection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the boxes are open.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dispenser, and it dispenses a
bunch of chipped ice on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works great on a small scale,
but doing those boxes one at a time is
[SPEAKER_02]: high labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: One that we've seen that doesn't cool very
much is just using the tap water or well
[SPEAKER_02]: water that's whatever the temperature of
your ground water is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll take a lot of the field heat out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are delivering on the same day,
it'll be cold enough as long as it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: sold within a day, you can get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cheap if you have that
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then cooling with solid ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is absolutely the cheapest one,
the one everybody starts with,
[SPEAKER_02]: because all it takes is one of those
plastic shovels and a box full of ice from
[SPEAKER_02]: the ice company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shovel the ice into the box one by
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs a fortune per box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people starting out, they use that
one, but the incentive to switch to
[SPEAKER_02]: something else is quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they use in California, a huge scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not super cheap,
but they have to do this to get it across
[SPEAKER_02]: the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is they inject an ice water
slurry into an entire pallet of boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the water ice mixture goes in
there, it gets into every nook and cranny,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the water comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, I mentioned that it's hard to
get market access for growers here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's hard for the markets to access
the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are a bunch of the problems that
people have run into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a program going on in New York
and a few other states in the East that is
[SPEAKER_02]: under the heading of Food Hub.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are aggregation sites where
there's a manager who will work with a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of different farms and consolidate
shipments, work with buyers who are used
[SPEAKER_02]: to calling up Salinas and saying,
hey, I need two truckloads of this and
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they'll be able to speak the same
language as the buyers and be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: negotiate fairly among the growers to
meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks the way it should look,
comes in the amount you promised.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows them to use cooling technology
more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so developing these food hubs is
something that's moving along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a great time working with
really the extension system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where the strength is in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question now is, can broccoli be as
cool as kale?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the last slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've told you a little bit about the
breeding and the physiology and how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking that and how do you bring it to
market so that the seed companies have an
[SPEAKER_02]: incentive to market to the Eastern growers
so that we can have a good base of Eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: growers all the way from Immokalee to the
St. John River Valley in the North with,
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular, a nice big group in Western
New York where there's huge potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: tens of millions of dollars of production
in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are non-heading broccoli varieties,
but the labor cost in harvesting that is
[SPEAKER_01]: so high that that is very limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: The non-heading types have received much
less breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the quality consistency is lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great for market gardens and home gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of all those traits that you believe to
be the most important, it's the doming
[SPEAKER_03]: that is the one that didn't really change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know any genes that control doming
based on work in brassicas?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flattening of the dome is when the
outer branches, the oldest branches,
[SPEAKER_02]: start to grow first as it's getting ready
to bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting closer to antithesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will start to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing of that stem elongation
relative to the maturity of the head,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that time has shifted a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm really saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know which genes control that,
for sure, but that's the timing event
[SPEAKER_02]: that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A genetically complex trait, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This seems like an obvious question,
but are you working with any greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: growers or doing any trials with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like that's going to pay
off for most markets because we can move
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost of producing broccoli in a hoop
house is so much higher than shipping it
[SPEAKER_02]: from a few hundred miles away,
which is the distance that the hoop house
[SPEAKER_02]: would benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the non-heading types, there's
actually some work on the Atlantic
[SPEAKER_02]: seaboard for doing hoop houses with some
of the non-heading ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can actually over-venture them,
and so they work for a CSA restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have those in very early spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas, what are other goals of the
project in the next phase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your goals in the next phase of the
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually easy to answer because I'm
busy writing the grammar code right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to understand the genetics of
the complex traits better because to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve them further, we're going to have
to use molecular markers to identify the
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations because we're not going to
get enough difference between a single,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll call them, one level of genetic
tolerance from a high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that stacking because they're not
single gene traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be careful about my
terminology here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to put more layers of that on,
we need to be using the molecular markers
[SPEAKER_02]: to see when we're combining different
sources of resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Developing the food hubs is actually a
significant part of it because we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that volume grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the new growers who might be tens
to a hundred acres of broccoli,
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of scale for their broccoli as
part of their vegetable mix, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to need the distribution channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting that regional trialing system
expanded to include a lot more seed
[SPEAKER_02]: companies so there's more contribution to
the overall improvement of variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the areas that we're looking at
primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thomas, in terms of carbon footprint,
might it not be argued that trucking
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli from Immokalee to New York or
Boston is as carbon intensive as flying it
[SPEAKER_00]: from California to New York?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not as flying it, but trucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you're going, yeah, Immokalee to
Boston versus Salinas to Boston or New
[SPEAKER_02]: York to Boston, it's not a huge difference
because they're both big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, going from Urbosa County,
Maine to Atlanta, or going from Guanajuato
[SPEAKER_02]: in Mexico to Atlanta, that's not really
very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do hit a sort of breaking point
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where Miguel Gomez's work has
been modeling that as far as for each of
[SPEAKER_02]: the different major markets in the East,
how much should be supplied from East
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast by the distance for it to make sense
so they don't try to invest in something
[SPEAKER_02]: that really doesn't have very much
potential because there's not that much
[SPEAKER_02]: local benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious about, is spring or fall
a better market, or does it do better in
[SPEAKER_03]: spring and fall in this region?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does way better in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spring is really challenging because it
wants to grow when it's warm,
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetatively, and it wants to head when
it's cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the exact opposite of what
happens in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So spring is really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our most difficult season to find
that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to thank Thomas for the
fascinating lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
