[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really delighted to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first slide just shows a few of the
garden staff that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was explaining this morning that
there's one gardener for vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: one for flowers, one for native plants,
and one for fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a few helpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people in the center were helpers
until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to make this go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you might wonder what a gardener
thinks about when they're gardening every
[SPEAKER_00]: day, eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got thinking about how
Jefferson's plants really kind of fuse
[SPEAKER_00]: three or more different climatic areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of brings them to the kitchen
and the origin of southern foodways more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less is starting at Monticello,
as well as other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the topic of my talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been to Monticello,
the garden is 1,000 feet long,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's on its own terrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main house, you can see, is uphill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jefferson, in 1806, started
having seven slaves to dig out the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountainside to make this beautiful
terrace for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about two acres long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the UNESCO World Heritage Site,
the whole place, because of so many
[SPEAKER_00]: activities that Jefferson was involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real hub for new thought and
enlightenment era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are descending the steps,
you can see the terrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the sun is sinking in the
west.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a very south-facing garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this bank that acts as a
thermal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The design of the garden is in squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squares have grass paths between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can access the garden when it
rains, because it's clay soil that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: really compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 98% compaction after construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dimensions are exactly what
Jefferson had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to grow all the plants that
Jefferson had, as well, if I can determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in this because we did have
archaeology in the garden on the bank at
[SPEAKER_00]: one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up in the upper left, you can see that
image is a sketch that Jefferson made of
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: In steps so that you'd have these thorny
bushes placed along the bank, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe to stop erosion or animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it the olytory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fascinating word because
oleraceae is in so many botanical names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means it comes from the kitchen
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever see a fishinalis on the name,
it's more or less a medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes from that Latin word,
olus, which means pot, herb, or vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Devin Floyd is standing there next to
this clay bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that he actually,
when they go back to the original soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bank, they can find these steps that
were designed by Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rock conglomeration there,
that is actually at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like maybe in Jefferson's
day, there really was erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a faced stone wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just stacked in there,
kind of like, let's get this thing from
[SPEAKER_00]: stop from collapsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I go back, you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 45 degree angle today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jefferson's day, it would have had an
extra six feet of garden space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wall is actually 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love to have that, but it's
impractical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've only excavated this certain
little area where they intended to put
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes through the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't done the rest of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted them to find glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted a cold frame, but it
didn't happen for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson's garden, this huge area,
it's two acres, was always intended as an
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's trying out all kinds of plants,
everything he can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he hears anything in a newspaper,
he writes a letter, says, send me that
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber, send me that gourd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to try and find which two are the
best to grow in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he also, of course, takes these
things to the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of the garden this
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a lot of tomatoes this year because
we were making a tomato jam, but we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them all up on poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here and there, you'll see little
methods that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is this Texas bird pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone sends it to him from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the only reason he has it is
somebody sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a hot weather plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says right there, if it's hardy
enough for our climate, then it'll live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's thinking about climate all of his
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a kind of chilt pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in his lifetime, he has a huge list of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see 48 kinds of beans,
15 kinds of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all of these are specifically
identified as varieties like we have today
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't have the tentacle
nomenclature in his day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has things from friends,
or he's calling something forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might mean it grows earlier or
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try my best to figure out what all of
these things mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so far, well, this year,
I had 230 vegetables and herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, I had like 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a short year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see they have some unusual
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, I'll show you some plants
with a little plant quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1774, he grew seven kinds of
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a garden, how many of you
have ever grown seven kinds of pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did have space along the river to
try these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always looking for that black
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a black pumpkin?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have the sweet potato pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow Marina de Keoghia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Zucca de Pescatori.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read Italian books, then it's that
knobby, that green warded, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: still growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so cool to find, to really nail
something down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow the white bower pumpkin,
the Zucca Bianchi, because it's from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boers had great gardens in South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And possibly he had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaps faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson was keeping weather data his
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he claims climate is one of the
sources of greatest sensual enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many of you agree with
that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wants everybody to take weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has this idea that we need to gather
this and make a nationwide index of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every morning, he rises and he
takes the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 4 PM, he takes the temperature and he
gathers this data for his whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in Philadelphia,
he's gathering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he leaves Virginia, he asks somebody to
take the data for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's charts and charts of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he also wants the appearance of
birds, of frosts, of leafing out of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants all of this phenological data,
which is so important and so valuable to
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when Lewis and Clark goes west,
he wants all of these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are they taking a boat west,
but they have to observe temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: frost, wind, time of flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he goes to Europe,
he has the Virginians back home to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Madison does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has this really cool thing,
what I recommend to a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have new gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, take a thimble every Monday and
plant a thimble full of lettuce in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says from February to September.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go through the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now today, we know lettuce will not
germinate at over 85 degrees in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in his day, they didn't take soil
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that he's going to
establish spring planting times and fall
[SPEAKER_00]: planting times just because of the
failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in the book and it says,
fails to mature, fails to come up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are actually opportunities
to figure out what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never considered Jefferson ever
really thinking he's failing at anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leap into what I can figure out
and how to make it work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he has this gardening calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, February 1, he's putting
out asparagus stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: With February 15, he sows the peas,
lettuce, spinach, and celery.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he starts out as a young man of 1767
planting his garden, he's planting lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I saw that, I thought,
no, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so May is way too hot for lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time he gets to this calendar,
which is 1824, he's figured out that he
[SPEAKER_00]: has a really early planting date for these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's going to be too hot in Virginia to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's coming from, maybe his
ancestry is Scottish and it's like cold
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to figure out the climate for
Virginia to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow this schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't have peas in on Lincoln's
birthday, we won't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants will perish without producing seeds
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he almost has the phenology of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Rocky Mountains calendar,
but you can actually make this for your
[SPEAKER_00]: own calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know when the red buds are
blooming, we'll have flea beetles in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just synchronous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a calendar because it was
convenient to put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can make one of these yourself if
you keep data in a little notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he almost has the growing degree
day thing, I think, because he's got all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the high and low temperatures
each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing degree day is when you add it
together and divide it by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if a pea comes up, you start your
growing degree day calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 338 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two leaves on the pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping one day to go back through
all those charts and figure out his
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree days versus our growing
degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be terrific?
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's almost got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also gets these foods from different
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's got, of course, the enslaved
are bringing foods from Africa and the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Indies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his own salad bowl culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got the Native American foods
that arrived with the Lewis and Clark
[SPEAKER_00]: expedition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the examples of a cold
weather northern European kind of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really technical to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is sea kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you know the sea kale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it grows on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the culture back then was like the
beach would cover it with the gravel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you dig it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be light colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have sea kale pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a pot nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cover the plant when it's emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get this beautiful yellow stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jefferson, in his day, they would have
potted them up, bringing them inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: and forced them all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an easy thing to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a just throw the seeds in and
have a beet or a carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, we have centers of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really pleased to see that you
have that kind of demonstration at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have certain plants came from
certain climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can figure out where they're
from, then you can grow them at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in Virginia, we have like a 10
month growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just plug things in at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll flourish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got this picture with the castor
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can see that they're from,
I think, over there on the African center
[SPEAKER_00]: of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's peanuts and cottons from South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, you have flax and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're eastern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no flax in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a picture taken like two days
ago in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had any frost yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's some peppers from South
America, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of North American crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many Chinese crops for us in our
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Referencing that previous slide,
is there evidence of enslaved people
[SPEAKER_05]: having brought seeds with them from their
native lands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, the food that was on the
ships to feed them were their native
[SPEAKER_00]: foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how a lot of these things came
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a couple of those in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson went to Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had various civic duties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you what Paris looked
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 1792.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the green areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to Paris lately,
you'll notice that those green areas are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not green any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the corner is his, can I walk over
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw that image, I thought,
what was he growing in that garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't where he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rest is like pleasure gardens with
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has the stables over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything around him is gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he really, I think, has a lot of
influence from his Paris experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little list in the book,
it was a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis Epps was his relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sends these seeds back to Virginia from
all of these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like, I think, four kinds of
cauliflower, like five kinds of peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the whole list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to grow the Paris garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the things that he's missing when
he's in Paris are the things at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet potatoes, corn, and watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things aren't in Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real Virginian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there wishing he had some hominy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did grow the garden of Paris of the
1786 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we have some cauliflowers,
cabbages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pea was really proud to actually find
this pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it the Dora gray pea of Holland
for frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually did some research and
looked through all these old books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually the degraced sugar pea
that you get from Baker Creek seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, if I grow something that I
think is what he's talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it grows wonderfully, and maybe if
he's grown it a couple years, that must be
[SPEAKER_00]: it most likely is what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he'd keep growing something
that doesn't grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's really a good thrill,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he meets André Thuyen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had basically the same lifespan,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thuyen dies two years before Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had Jordan the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is called the Jordan du Roy back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a seed exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And André is sending up to 700 different
seeds for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, a big box would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, one year when the box didn't
come, he said, what happened to André's
[SPEAKER_00]: box?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had a huge exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jefferson sends all kinds of trees to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose you could find out if we had
any descendants over there or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was one place where he got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another influence was Philip Metzai,
who was from Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philip was an amazing guy who was here to
establish a wine company and some
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural interests and became friends
with Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Metzai starts to establish the
vineyards for Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brings over 10 Italian gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them remained in the
Charlottesville area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a sentence here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of us, of course,
in the Paris era, all of his journal
[SPEAKER_00]: references are in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of the journal references are
in Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Philip is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we have these vineyards
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can notice the sort of rough
wooden structures that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we have 22 varieties that
they're tended to grow on the left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the upper side is a sandiovese
grapes that we can harvest for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was interesting about Philip
Metzai is that if you look at the,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of a fuzzy picture,
if you look at the latitude between
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, which is sort of like in this
little dent here, and you look over to
[SPEAKER_00]: where Philip was from Italy, they kind of
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of about the same latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually looked at the ethnobotany
of Philip's area and found salad brunette,
[SPEAKER_00]: for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it Salvestrella de Pisa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, sounds like brunette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked in there and we found
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it's salad brunette.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's growing it really early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these things we kind of can
nail down by looking at that if Philip
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then Jefferson also travels in
Italy while he's in Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he finds olive trees that are six feet
in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sees wine growing, Parmesan cheese,
macaroni mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not molding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the press that you can make macaroni
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rice and silk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tries to steal rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a famous story that you can look
online and read about how he's in upland
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy with his donkey driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go to this rice patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really wants this certain kind of
upland rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says to the farmer, can I take a
bag of rice home?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a 50 pound bag of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to introduce it to South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have this regional rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take things away from certain
regions in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson says, OK, can I have a little
bag of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, OK, you can have a bag of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tells his donkey driver,
you take a bag of it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go across the border,
you can get killed for having this rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they brings it back to South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, people in South Carolina
said, we have this rice that we really
[SPEAKER_00]: like better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll tell you another rice story in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to mention about food and how
because you don't understand how important
[SPEAKER_00]: the food aspect of this is until you look
back and see that in the Middle Ages,
[SPEAKER_00]: food was mostly meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was spiced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put time on something that's
moldy, you can destroy bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time kills bacteria in 60 seconds or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all of these strange foods
that basically are heavily spiced or being
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitized by the herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they even put, I think they had
gilded on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had this meatloaf of birds that
they put feathers over the top of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a whole lot of heavy meat
dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of exit that kind of era of
food when John Evelyn was writing about
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also wrote about horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'll read about his quote about
lettuces, he was really introducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: salad into the diet once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his treatise of horticulture,
he has ascetaria as a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, lettuce is a principal
foundation of the unifl to try those
[SPEAKER_00]: salads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has beneficial influences on
morals, temperance, and chastity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never thought about that when I ate a
salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's a fascinating guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got great books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has all the tools listed that they
had in that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually in Europe, it started
being influenced by North American foods
[SPEAKER_00]: or South American foods with the beans,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this big trade and a different change
in diet to be more of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to mention this guy,
Lava Ren, who has a cookbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is the person who's starting French
foods that has the idea of vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting fresh, not vegetables stewed up
and cooked into soups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fresh vegetables with a sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the start of French cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get it in translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson goes to Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings along Sally to take care of his
two daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then James, Sally's brother,
these were slaves, comes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has James apprentice to his
caterer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends him to Chantilly,
which is a picture down below,
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn to cook in that kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kitchen is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the size of it, all of the
exquisite pots and technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really top notch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are serving kings and queens in this
castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of food that Jefferson
is going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have another picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So James, for instance, he learns to make
this beautiful fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he brings it back to Monticello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues as the bell fritters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes like apple fritters later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gets a little rustic after a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's got this French influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really top notch, beautiful
cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the kitchen that Jefferson
builds when he gets back from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the left are stew
stoves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all the best copper pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hearth is back there with a clock jack
that's kind of an odd little thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle, a big oven on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got this stone mortar, which is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for making pesto.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful kitchen to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to show you this because you
can see the kitchen that we're familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stew stoves on the left, they allow
you to put charcoal under a pot and have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a low temperature cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can regulate with grids on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little outlays here, this is just to
take ash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in the upper left-hand corner,
you can see that pavilion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a pavilion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first structure Jefferson built
at Monticello.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was to live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And downstairs was the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been kind of a men's bathroom
since the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, we had enough money to
excavate that and bring it back to be what
[SPEAKER_00]: it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing is that that
pavilion does doesn't match the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: Monticello house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monticello has the two terraces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is at the end of one terrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he decides to build Monticello,
the hillside that he's building on doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just has the workers fill the bottom
of the pavilion in with three feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill it up, and we'll go on from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the archaeologists then took out
the three feet of fill this winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had 40,000 artifacts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the yard's dirt is full of debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've got amazing material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom of it, they find the
original stew stove foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the charcoal from 1808 was in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they found other parts of the whole
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very exciting to know that they
actually had these stew stoves and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: really early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he builds this big kitchen to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that this food is really
exquisite, and Jefferson was known to have
[SPEAKER_00]: given really great dinners and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Garnier, everybody knows about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's put a bunch of herbs in soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a whole series of different
kinds invented by this guy, Labyrinth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson ends up growing all of these
herbs that are mentioned by him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one reason for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a list of herbs that he decides to
grow in 1794.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we personally know all those herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the enslaved people have all of
these plants that they bring as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Karen Hess has done a lot of work on,
she's passed away now, but she has done a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work with finding these origins of
southern cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael Twitty as well, he's just
released a book about southern cuisine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see he's cooking in our kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David Shields does a lot of work,
very interesting work on finding sources
[SPEAKER_00]: for the original plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually went to Trinidad recently
because the Americans were a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: enslaved people that had been freed and
hired by the British to fight in the War
[SPEAKER_00]: of 1812.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in return, they got free land in
Trinidad, and they brought their seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the red upland bearded rice that
Jefferson had has been grown in Trinidad
[SPEAKER_00]: ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll come back to have one of cellos
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some of the seeds from the
enslaved people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is denny or sesame, and it has a
nice white flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pods make these beautiful
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jefferson was hoping to make oil from
this instead of olive oil, because olives
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't grow very well at Monticello.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow lots of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's okra.
[SPEAKER_00]: The okra plants grow really tall and huge,
and they're used to make soups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew it around his tomatoes as a
barricade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jefferson felt that when Martha cooked
the eggplants, it tasted like soft crabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he was pretty landlocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The West India gherkin is an amazing thing
that came in with the slaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are extremely tiny, but the
plant is so prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really tasty little crunchy
cucumber that doesn't cross-pollinate with
[SPEAKER_00]: their average cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sorghum is a kind of millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain varieties have that sweet syrup in
the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to grow more of that in our
garden, because Jefferson called it guinea
[SPEAKER_00]: corn at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Carolina African runner peanut
that actually came off of slave ship in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1670.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is profusely prolific with
peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know how peanuts grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of you seen peanuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are pollinated, the flower sends
a peg into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that forms the peanut nut underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you lift up a peanut plant,
it's full of these pegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually creates a big mat of
peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're used mostly for cooking oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the Lewis and Clark expedition
left Monticello in 1803.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then went out to try to find the
Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they went up this branch of the
river, they got up to about here when they
[SPEAKER_00]: met snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they built a fort and lived until
April of the next year with the products
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Mandan, Iroquois, and Hidatsa
tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down at the bottom is the boat that the
Mandans used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is the boat that the
Lewis and Clark expedition used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their situation is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a three-month growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we actually have a seed exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the beans and corn and
sunflowers, et cetera, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: descendants of these tribes to grow at
Monticello once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Hidatsa bean is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes like 120 pods sometimes on one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a legend that one seed will feed
12 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really comes out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got the Hidatsa bean,
I had 15 seeds and a 40-foot row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, what is going to happen
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, each plant was so prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the short growing season,
they get a lot of food that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the Mandan corn that we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left is the red clay corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a white flower corn in
the middle and a red flower corn in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting, because it's a really
historically corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only goes up to four or five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant tillers out with the cobs
along the bottom of the stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking they don't have raccoons,
but we don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this corn, because it's so tiny,
it's right next to the Hidatsa bean here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hand-pollinate all the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hand-pollinate all the cobs of corn to
make sure we get a good crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Irychorus sunflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grows in cold weather as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they plant it when the ice breaks up on
the Missouri River.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's like March 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the seeds in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs 45 degrees soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this sunflower picture was probably
taken June 1st or 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grow really fast in the cold
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pizza-sized heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the seed exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we first started back in
2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really interesting to grow
these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew some in the fall this year,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jefferson grew all of these different
climatic regional plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in his day, it was pretty amazing,
because Jefferson and the colonists
[SPEAKER_00]: basically had spring gardens and fall
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't grow summer crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you visit us at the garden
someday soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's my contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll give you a little plant
quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this idea to show you some plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, can you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I did show you this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stalk is really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it folded up three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anybody recognize this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got these really great pods that,
when you open them up, all the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lined up like a little vending
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that gorgeous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully these have all left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sesame, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a really nice little flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's some young pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a chef visit who decided to try to
cook the young pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there, see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that grows really well for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Show you some corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mandan red flower corn and the
white flower corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this is what I got to plant,
this is what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that we didn't get any
blue ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe we just had yellow pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you that in
relationship to Damon Morgan's Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take these away, which is a corn that
we make into hominy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I open this one up, you can see the
relative size of a ear of corn versus what
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indians were producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Indians were doing the Mandan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 800 acres of their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tool that they used to garden with
was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognize this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an antler.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would tie an antler to a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other hoe was made of a scapula
from the buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they figured out how to cache the
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then when visitors and explorers
from Canada, from the British,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Spanish all arrived at that place on
the Missouri they had plenty to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Indians had all the latest in
cooking pots, calico, pans, and needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very sharp people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got here some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody recognize these little fuzzies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chestnuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did see this one out in your garden
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the red foliated white cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the seeds are right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hirsutum cotton, which means the
sticky seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hirsut name, it means it's got this
fuzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the green lint cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know there was green lint cottons?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also a sticky seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably Earline's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nanking cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's written about in Jefferson's book
as a yellow cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cloth actually became called
Nanking from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have this cotton here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the seeds are slipping out
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Sea Island brown cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I believe, a Barbadense
variety instead of hirsutum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing about this is that all of
these hirsutum cottons with the sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds grow better in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jefferson needs a gin to take the
seeds out because it takes so much time to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull this apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gets the cotton gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Secretary of State in also running
the patent office when Eli Whitney sends
[SPEAKER_00]: in plans for the cotton gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, is this really a dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you really have this machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need like two of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gin is saw blades that will tear up
the cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you showed somebody a gin with this
kind of cotton, they would die because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're cutting the fibers up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing is that you want the
longest fiber you can get to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: straighten it out and then twist it into
thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Ecuadorians have a cotton
that's very long fiber, about four inches
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just remove the seeds by hand and
then straighten it out by whacking it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a stick on a pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really beautiful, long fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long thread that they can make from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Egyptian cotton, it's a barbed
density as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smooth seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you this crazy little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognize these?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are quite mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this, the gherkin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut it in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how big these seeds are in
here, how many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each seed is an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut this one this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer seeds when it's smaller,
but still.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is get it when it's
tiny, like this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to show you the gherkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just harvested them for seed recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the whole thing is edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know it's fun with kids because
it's all prickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you eat that prickly thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a couple of pods from our
friend, the okra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you what they look like
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're this size, they are pretty
fibrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're smaller, about this size,
then we eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we save them for seeds and for
Christmas decorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody recognize this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dried one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dried artichoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use this for Christmas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artichokes we grow don't have very
good flavor and qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recognize these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jefferson called this the most minuteest
board ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sends it to his grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Tennessee spinning board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow toys in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knew that Jefferson had a sense of
humor?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be hard for you to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is right here at
the top, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you have there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if how many of you have
seen lettuce go to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, here's all the seeds down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut the heads off usually shorter than
this, like about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry the heads in the greenhouse,
in a dry greenhouse, and then crush them
[SPEAKER_00]: through sieves to get the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is the ants love
lettuce seed, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're in a rush, we can just
pick up the newspaper and underneath will
[SPEAKER_00]: be cute little piles of lettuce seed
already clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just can scoop it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll show you this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it under here because it's one
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody recognize this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow the Orinoco tobacco,
which is what Jefferson would have had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from Suriname.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read a book by Afer Ben from the
1600s, the first book by a woman author
[SPEAKER_00]: describing the plight of slaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became a stage play in the
Victorian era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about Orinoco, who was a slave.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually a prince to marry the
princess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's sold as a slave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he and his wife-to-be have a pact
that they're going to kill each other
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, his wife is actually taken by his
dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really bad stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his last words is, all I want before I
die is to smoke a pipe of Orinoco tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is being dried now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really liked this fall was that
it was such a ladybug factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some evidence of bugs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had aphids galore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the aphids all attracted ladybugs
and all kinds of beneficial insects that
[SPEAKER_00]: were using the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many ladybugs we have in the garden
because this happened on our sorghum last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had no reason to remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a ladybug larvae every six inches
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a whole patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a tobacco farmer came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, usually I wash all these
leaves off because of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, no one else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll show you a couple of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be done, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one special tool that I was telling
you about right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have thimble today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Jefferson's day, every woman and
child would have had a thimble and some
[SPEAKER_00]: men too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you this beautiful thing
that I got recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw this on one of your posters in
the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anybody know what this tool is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a string line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use string lines for everything
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use a compass with a string line to
make sure everything is parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes use measuring sticks to
measure out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I love this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually 1800s, something a
little less extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you that because
that's what Jefferson, something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: is what Jefferson had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what his Indian neighbors were
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the different ways of gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for putting up with
my eccentricities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill, you alluded a couple of times to
critters that have animals in the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you folks have to do to keep
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about bugs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking about four-legged mammals?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, four-legged mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an electric fence we put up
every night for deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some woodchucks that are just
monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put up a fence every night,
take it down every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three dogs that we let out to get
the little animals, raccoons, and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a beautiful baby raccoon tree last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have other things, skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of animals because they're
right in the woods, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crows are really obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put cages over any emerging corn or
beans because they'll pull them right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let them get up to a good height
before we take the cage off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the electrical fence, obviously not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are these other methods sort of period
appropriate?
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any thoughts of what he did back then
with these problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what his crow problem
might have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had a paling fence, which means
ribbon boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had been 12 feet high around the
whole garden, including the fruit garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like almost a mile long fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boards were close enough so his
hair wouldn't go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a rabbit wouldn't go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he had the fence built,
Martha would write to him saying that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pigs are trashing the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had animal problems beyond ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam, would you ask if Geneva has any
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Geneva right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, you have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for this wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your earlier slides said that he
had 15 types of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the crop I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever been able to find or grow
those kinds or seen them or know any extra
[SPEAKER_01]: information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to send you an email instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the list that I have for
broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you recognize any of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we grow the white broccoli,
the early purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown different kinds of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just sort of label them as Roman or
green or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the black broccoli down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really enjoyed it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard conflicting things about
whether Jefferson grew the love apple,
[SPEAKER_05]: the tomato.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the palm d'amore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it grows beautifully for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is evidence that Jefferson
didn't grow it?
Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's a tricky question because in
Jefferson's day, well, I'll show you what
[SPEAKER_00]: he says about tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tomato, Spanish tomato bigger than
the other ones and the dwarf tomato that
[SPEAKER_00]: runs around the ground like a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all he's got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that he goes to Williamsburg
and meets.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family physician is Dr. John de
Siqueira, who I'm probably pronouncing his
[SPEAKER_00]: name wrong, but he's working at
Williamsburg and he advocates eating
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato every day for eternal health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been changed over time,
hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that's in the early,
that's the 1760s or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1781, and there's notes on the
state of Virginia, Jefferson lists
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes along with musk melons and
passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that tomato is, you know,
just being cultivated in Virginia without
[SPEAKER_00]: much fanfare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but this is all he says because of
that issue of not having variety of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow all kinds of tomatoes and
basically the Casteludo, Genovese,
[SPEAKER_00]: Casteludo, Catanese, because Italy has its
regionality and has a tomato variety for
[SPEAKER_00]: each region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been in cultivation since the
15th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1500s, the Medici family had tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became the food of the peasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to grow things that grow
well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year we grew Cherokee purple
tomatoes, which did not grow very well at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't from seeds that we had saved
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to save some seeds and see if
they'll grow better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a modern 1990 tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just not suited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not suitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this lady had a question forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any sense of what regular
folks in Virginia in 1805 were growing in
[SPEAKER_08]: their gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some, there's some references.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some guy named Edwin Ruffin who
was reading and he was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: manureing and crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it'd be interesting to see
if any of Jefferson's information depth is
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersed to his neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had, he did have, his friend George
Divers at Farmington, who's down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlottesville.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're uphill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 800 feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in Charlottesville, George had his
farm and Jefferson would send some of his
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to George as a plan B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in case mine fail, you'll have the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a pea contest, which is
always touted to all the kids who had the
[SPEAKER_00]: first dish of peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person would give a big
dinner with the peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one year Jefferson's peas came in
first, but he says to Martha, George just
[SPEAKER_00]: loves giving a dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to tell him our peas came
in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some of that, but that's a
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I really should look
into.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of records about Jefferson
bringing in trees from, to exchange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any of those trees grown on the
property?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be really great if trees could
persist 250 years, but we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have records of what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we re reintroduce those trees and
we have, you know, put them in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one interesting thing is that he has
a, that really large leaf Magnolia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's macrophyllum and he's got it
on the, you know, the house and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden, the flower garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the slope is called, we call it
the upper Grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got them sited there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should, should have taken a picture,
but where they're sited, they're facing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a North facing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the West, when the sun sinks in
the West, here, the North side of that
[SPEAKER_00]: tree trunk is frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the West sunshine hits the
trunk in the winter time, it splits it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of the Magnolias have these
splits in the trunk and then they die and
[SPEAKER_00]: we cut them off and then they come back
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been there over and over again,
but it's a terrible location, but we put
[SPEAKER_07]: it in that American tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: So did he bring any Asian or European?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets things from, from Andre from in
Paris, a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are written down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not a tree expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone has one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like you have like this large
collection of plants with like these fun
[SPEAKER_04]: histories to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just wondering what's the most
effective way you found to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate these histories with visitors
who are just kind of passing through the
[SPEAKER_04]: garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well it's, we have this garden
ambassador program with master gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: from 10 to two, who answer the question
that everybody asks is like, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens to all the vegetables?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes all that weight off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when they have a really cool
question, they send them over and I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to them and I can mention something
like, did you know this is where sesame
[SPEAKER_00]: is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we're just somewhere and somebody is
poking around and saying, that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: a, and then they get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, oh, well that's actually a
pumpkin or that's actually an eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really do try to help people along
when they're, when they look interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well I want to again thank Pat for
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
