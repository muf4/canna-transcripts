[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like to do with my time here
today is to talk about a survey that I and
[SPEAKER_01]: others have been very involved with over
the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you the survey results,
and both are to some very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, and most of the information
will be presented in charts, on the very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had some open-ended questions
that also created and generated some very
[SPEAKER_01]: good information about what growers are
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before I finish up, Andy
mentioned immigration reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put some of the things that we
found in this survey in the context of
[SPEAKER_01]: immigration reform, because that is so
much on the mind of growers today and has
[SPEAKER_01]: so much relevance to the future of
labor-intensive agriculture like apple
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me start by recognizing the co-authors
of this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all is Paul Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul is the executive director of the New
York State Horticultural Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul said that, Paul actually came to me
and asked if we could do this survey,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said that he would help get the
survey out and get the responses back,
[SPEAKER_01]: which he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allison DeMarie retired over the last year
as a regional fruit specialist,
[SPEAKER_01]: but her background in fruit production and
economics was very invaluable to this
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicole Ho was a grad student from the
Dyson School who helped do data analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the leadership on writing the
report, which will be out shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brad Rickard helped with the data
analysis and the manuscript review and
[SPEAKER_01]: input on the report.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me tell you about what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me first say that Paul Baker in
the Hort Society spends a lot of his time
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the Labor Department and
other government agencies, getting them to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand horticulture and in this case,
the apple industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that, one of his
motivations was that if he has specific
[SPEAKER_01]: information about what goes on in the
orchard, he can help inform the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating through Labor Department and
other agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other motivation, the motivation for
us in Extension is to have a data set and
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to say something more about the
industry and about workforce issues in the
[SPEAKER_01]: apple industry than what our government
data sets give us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we get labor information from the
census and we get some from the New York
[SPEAKER_01]: Ag Statistics and there is something
called the Agricultural Workers Survey out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Washington, but none of those give us
the detail that we can get when we do a
[SPEAKER_01]: survey such as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, Paul, through the Hort Society,
took the initiative to mail out 480
[SPEAKER_01]: surveys to apple growers who contribute to
the New York State Apple Order for
[SPEAKER_01]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked, it was a three page survey,
we asked the growers to report their
[SPEAKER_01]: information based on the 2013 growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 95 usable responses back,
about 20% response rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were fairly pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I want to point
out right up front, especially with so
[SPEAKER_01]: many grad students, in the audience,
is that this is not a random sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 95 growers who self-selected to
return our survey form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we have to be careful
about expanding to the entire industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because, I'll give you one example here at
the bottom of the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just so happens that many of the people
who decided to send this back happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: be growers who used the H2A program,
about half of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a random sample,
but nonetheless, we have more detailed
[SPEAKER_01]: information about what's going on in New
York Apple Farms than is available
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of bearing acres per farm,
this slide, gives you a sense that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: get responses from every size group.
[SPEAKER_01]: 19% were greater than 250 acres,
19% were also less than 20 acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then distributed in between that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one group is far larger than the
other in terms of size based on acres in
[SPEAKER_01]: the survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked for their three-year average
annual apple production, and specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: asked for the three-year average because
there was a very poor year with frost
[SPEAKER_01]: damage and cold damage to the crop that
really reduced some people's yields a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we asked for the three-year
average, and you can see how that
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution contributes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we asked for the total number of
workers, and not surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: the workers, you can see very visually
there that the workers are concentrated in
[SPEAKER_01]: the top two size groups, 100 to 250 acres
and over 250 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we asked for the total number of
workers, and we asked each grower what
[SPEAKER_01]: region that they produced in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are far more charts that will
be in the report than I'm able to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: here today, but we were able to cross-tab
between regions and get some interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are basically four
apple-growing regions in the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: central and western New York, northern New
York, eastern New York, and Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long Island is not a very big player in
all this, although Long Island is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural spot for New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't all that many apples grown on
Long Island, but this gives you a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: how many, how much response we got from
all over the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only got five responses from northern
New York, but you can see that up in,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the Lake Champlain region,
there are very few farms up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they account for a lot of the apple
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple farms hiring H2A workers,
and so I alluded to this earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: 48% said we hire on our farm H2A workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other 52% said that they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the reasons why this is
important is that in that 52%,
[SPEAKER_01]: very likely there are some growers who
have some undocumented workers who are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally, what I find from talking to
growers is even if you are in the H2A
[SPEAKER_01]: program and hire some H2A workers,
you might also have some non-H2A workers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are undocumented workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, many people have looked at
and discussed the fact that even though we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have specific numbers, undocumented
workers are not only a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: labor-intensive, all kinds of
labor-intensive agriculture, but they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: part, likely, of the New York apple
industry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who may not be familiar
with the H2A program, let me just make a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of comments about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The H2A program is a government,
federal government-run program operated
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Labor Department that brings
in seasonal agricultural workers for
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial farms in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come here for up to 10 months,
and then they go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time of year, growers are filling out
their work orders and planning ahead to
[SPEAKER_01]: get their workers for the coming growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home country of H2A workers,
primarily in this state, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: workers are coming from Mexico and or
possibly other Central American countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are coming from there, but most of
them are coming from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just go into more detail in a
few minutes, but the H2A program is very
[SPEAKER_01]: controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive, and there's a lot of
paperwork and red tape involved in using
[SPEAKER_01]: the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's criticized.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if we look at the Lake
Champlain area and other areas of the
[SPEAKER_01]: state where Jamaican workers come to work
on apple farms and we talk to the growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will find that many times the growers
will say that these Jamaican workers have
[SPEAKER_01]: come here for sometimes for decades,
for 20, 30 years, the same workers coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back to work for eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very reliable from the growers
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the worker perspective,
they can come for eight weeks or 10 weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and make a fair amount of income compared
to their income potential at home and then
[SPEAKER_01]: have a much better standard of living in
their home country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The length of seasonal employment,
this just tells you that for those growers
[SPEAKER_01]: that hire seasonal workers, 28% just hire
harvest workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other 72% hire workers throughout the
season for various production practices
[SPEAKER_01]: such as pruning and thinning and other
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a crew leader, 26% said that they
did use a hired crew leader, and Allison
[SPEAKER_01]: DeMarie tells me that this number has
slowly decreased over the years and
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worker experience requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to go back to Paul Baker and
the Hort Society because a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the H2A program, one of the things
that happened and policies change and
[SPEAKER_01]: rules change based on political
administrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason in the Labor
Department, the Labor Department started
[SPEAKER_01]: to change their philosophy of what
experience was needed for apple pickers
[SPEAKER_01]: and orchard workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consequently, a few farmers would put
in their work order and find out that and
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for a lot of experience requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Labor Department said,
well, you don't need all these work
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they ended up sending, in some
cases, less experienced workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this created some concern in the
grower community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the growers went to Paul Baker at
the Hort Society and said, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: document the kinds of experience that
workers need because these are not
[SPEAKER_01]: unskilled jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this next set of slides gives you
some idea of the kinds of experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: growers feel that they need when they're
hiring workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 35% said, no, we can deal with the
workers in the workforce the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need previous experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 65% said, yes, we definitely need
previous experience for what we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to accomplish in our orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Months of experience required by types of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left-hand side, you get a sense of
the kinds of experience that is needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: pruning, equipment operation, tractor
driving, picking for both fresh and for
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have this whole list of
specific work experience requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which growers, not all growers ask
for this, but some growers do ask for all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these, pruning, chainsaw operation,
et cetera, all these different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that they want the workers to
have had for productivity reasons before
[SPEAKER_01]: they show up on the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a picking requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want workers that can pick quickly
and without bruising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two components to that
requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to be very productive and pick
quickly and also not bruise the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the average hours that we found
workers were working for picking was 8.6,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were doing all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be asked to pick drop apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be asked to do fresh stem
clipping, spot picking, cleaning the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: tree, and then picking for process apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the requirements on how fast they do
that depend upon how difficult or easy the
[SPEAKER_01]: job is to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, many of you may be familiar with
this, but I learned a few things as an ag
[SPEAKER_01]: economist doing this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I learned was about
fresh stem clipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know what that is,
very often you have a thin skinned
[SPEAKER_01]: apple-like honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you leave the stem on the apple and
that apple gets in a bin, with other
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycrisp apples, the stem is going to
pierce the skin of the other apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the worker, the picker,
is given a little set of clippers that
[SPEAKER_01]: look like small scissors, and that is used
to do the picking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've made this job of picking
apples even more complex because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to clip the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they pick the apple instead of just
pulling it off the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: How apple pickers get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave four choices for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the hour only, 26% said that's how they
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only by the piece, 14% said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 27% said we have a combination of
piece rates and hourly rates to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending upon what we're doing and how
easy or difficult it is to do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also goes to the last one,
depends, means it depends upon how
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult it is to do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a job gets difficult enough and you
can't make your piece rate by doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: job, it makes more sense for a grower to
use an hourly rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have all combinations of how
pickers get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wage rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will give you an idea of wage
rates for fresh apples, and this goes back
[SPEAKER_01]: to my comment about the random sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had average wage rates for the
entire industry, they would be a bit lower
[SPEAKER_01]: than what you see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have 48% of the growers in
the survey, as H2O, H2A growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the H2A rate is, I'm not sure what it was
for 2013, but it's around $11.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around $11 per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these rates are very likely higher than
what would be the average for the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think wage rates are really important
that we keep an eye on them and take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at them, examine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna talk about immigration reform in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big challenges that we have in
agriculture is paying enough to compete
[SPEAKER_01]: with other employers in the geographic
area that the business is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping an eye on and making sure
our wage rates are competitive is an
[SPEAKER_01]: important issue now, and I think it's
going to become even more important in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just gives you an idea of what
the piece rates are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The piece rates generally are by 20 bushel
bin, and this gives you an indication of
[SPEAKER_01]: those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the rate, as the job gets more
difficult, we start with cleaning the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire tree is the easiest job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that rate's a little lower,
and that goes all the way up to a much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher rate for fresh stem clipping when
that is required in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the things, one of the
opportunities we have, and this is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example of the kinds of information that
we cannot get from other government data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets, and that is we can ask in a survey
like this, what are your worker shortage
[SPEAKER_01]: issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have worker shortage issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have my slide, I don't have
the slide here for the whole group,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what that slide says is that 36% of
the growers said, in the whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: of all those who responded, 36% said that
they were short of workers in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gives you a bit of an idea of a
breakout by region of who said they were
[SPEAKER_01]: short of workers and who said that they
had sufficient workers, and central New
[SPEAKER_01]: York and northern New York indicated that
they were most short of workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we ask them, along these same lines,
what was the average number of additional
[SPEAKER_01]: workers that you would have hired if they
were available for your farm in 2013?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in some of the
smaller farms that started out with two
[SPEAKER_01]: workers and the very largest farm said
they would have hired almost 11 workers,
[SPEAKER_01]: full-time equivalent-wise, to work on the
farm if those workers were available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we went one step further and said,
well, what do you, as you look at your
[SPEAKER_01]: workforce needs in the future,
what are you anticipating?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many employees do you think that
you'll need three years from now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fewer, less, or stays the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 74% said that they were anticipating
with the needs of their business that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to need more employees than
what they hire today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has real implications for
immigration reform and where these workers
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna come from in the future and how
we source labor in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, so the last thing that
the grower got when he was filling out,
[SPEAKER_01]: he or she was filling out the survey was a
couple of open-ended questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's an opportunity for us to ask
some things about, they can answer the
[SPEAKER_01]: question any way they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it gets a little bit, you have to
then do this grouping, lumping,
[SPEAKER_01]: process at the end, but we end up writing
out all the answers on summary sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very interesting to look at what
growers say in an open-ended question when
[SPEAKER_01]: they can answer it any way they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked them first, what were the top
three issues that you think grower
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations that work on your behalf
should work on in the next five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor availability, and immigration,
and H2A, and efficiency, and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things were far and away above the
following two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So labor availability was number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not surprising, government regulation is
number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear that all the time, especially as
the farm grows in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then marketing, consumer education,
global markets, buy local, all those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those marketing issues were number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what they said they wanted
organizations that they belong to to do on
[SPEAKER_01]: their behalf in the years ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just is to reinforce the point
that we hear this not only in the Apple
[SPEAKER_01]: industry today, but many, many
labor-intensive industries that labor
[SPEAKER_01]: workforce issues are number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Management issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could solve that, life would
improve in terms of managing the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to me, this is the question that was
most of interest to me when we put this
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that was on my mind a
lot is, okay, we all know that immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: reform has stalled, but the farm manager
is dynamic, operates a dynamic business,
[SPEAKER_01]: and does not stop just because immigration
reform is stalled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to keep running this business
because they have such a large capital
[SPEAKER_01]: investment in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked the survey participants,
given the labor pressures that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced in the last several years,
including labor being short, how has or
[SPEAKER_01]: will your business change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are in order of the response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we grouped their open-ended
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order of priority, this is what
they said, orchard design, planting
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, and equipment to be more
labor-efficient was the biggest thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that goes, the second item
that goes along with this is downsizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: producing less, and decreasing acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that really means is with these
high-density planting systems that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: converted to in this state over the last
10 years with a vengeance, we are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing more apples on less acreage or
more apples, far more apples on the same
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third thing that they said is we are
relying more on H2A than we have in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past, which means two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the grower was not in the H2A
program, but was going to go to the H2A
[SPEAKER_01]: program to hire workers, and others were
hiring more workers through the H2A
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fourth, and this is not
surprising either, it's gone on for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades, if a business becomes too
labor-intensive or too complex,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are certain people who say we just
cannot come up with the capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we don't want to proceed with this
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The business is not viable for the next
generation, and we're going to opt out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some further comments on the open-ended
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers are reporting a shift to
high-density planting systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher yields per acre, platforms and
other equipment dramatically improve labor
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took this photo at the extension fruit
tour up in Orleans County this summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this gives you a look at two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the planting system is the tall
spindle planting system, a high-density
[SPEAKER_01]: system that has been developed and refined
and promoted at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is there you have in
the middle of that row a platform,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that platform, the workers stand on
the platform and can prune and can pick
[SPEAKER_01]: and do other operations that make the
operations far more labor-efficient than
[SPEAKER_01]: they ever were before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the one thing that is really
interesting to me about all of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the high-density planting system and
labor efficiency were not developed
[SPEAKER_01]: independently, it was all developed
together to be integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these, the row spacings and the
tying and all of these things were all put
[SPEAKER_01]: together in a way that labor could be the
very most productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing response to labor challenges,
make each full-time equivalent worker as
[SPEAKER_01]: productive as possible, and these new
systems certainly do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eliminate excess labor and less productive
acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the orchard, I was up in western
New York during apple harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of the things that's increasingly
clear, land prices in western New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the state are going up
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can be more productive on
the same acreage or less acreage,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't have the extra capital
investment of new acreage and new
[SPEAKER_01]: high-priced acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce risk by using the H2A program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't said anything about this
yet, but in New York, immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement pressure has been traumatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most likely reason appears to be
our border with Canada and a high critical
[SPEAKER_01]: mass of enforcement officers in ICE and in
Border Patrol out of Buffalo and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: North Country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one, there are several reasons why
a grower would use the H2A program.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to make sure that they have the
workers they need if there is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of labor shortage out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is to make sure that they don't
have workers that are undocumented and
[SPEAKER_01]: could get deported in the middle or
detained in the middle of the harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: season or the middle of the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reducing risk is becoming a more
important part of the H2A program and a
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation, especially in this state where
we have so much enforcement pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to other states, I talk to folks from
other states, and New York and Vermont
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to have a disproportionate share of
enforcement pressure and the growers feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that as they try to operate their
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing in their
open-ended questions that the growers said
[SPEAKER_01]: is we're going to continue to aggressively
advocate for immigration reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already made this point, growers report
an increasing reliance on H2A because
[SPEAKER_01]: other workers are not available,
they can manage risk, and it's a response
[SPEAKER_01]: to enforcement pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the H2A paradox, and I've sort of
been leading up to this, growers who use
[SPEAKER_01]: the H2A program are often very critical of
the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive, there's a lot of
paperwork, occasionally you don't get your
[SPEAKER_01]: workers on time, and growers don't like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the program so that their labor
needs will be predictable and their labor
[SPEAKER_01]: force will be predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there can be a few problems along
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, some growers have reported in
their open-ended question on this survey
[SPEAKER_01]: that without the H2A program, they don't
know what they'd do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the H2A program, they would
probably be out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so H2A is, especially in this state,
is becoming more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that I've gone through some of the
things we've found and there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: information that will be in our
publication that will be posted on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dyson website in the extension section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we've gotten to this point,
I want to put this in the context a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of immigration reform and what does
some of these things mean to immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about what agriculture wants
out of immigration reform policy,
[SPEAKER_01]: what agriculture wants is very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the entity that speaks for agriculture
in Washington is called the Agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: Workforce Coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a coalition of dozens of
agricultural groups like American Farm
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau, Western Growers, Western United
Dairymen, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the major farm organizations that
deal with labor-intensive agriculture are
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the coalition speaks with one voice,
and it says the following.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right before the last Congress,
almost three years ago, after the
[SPEAKER_01]: presidential election, they got together
and redid this and reinforced their
[SPEAKER_01]: position, which is that agricultural
operations must have access to a stable
[SPEAKER_01]: and skilled workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do this by doing two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is providing an adjustment in
immigration status for the undocumented
[SPEAKER_01]: workers that are already working in
agriculture so that they can stay and work
[SPEAKER_01]: in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that is needed is to
address workforce needs with a modern
[SPEAKER_01]: guest worker visa program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is if we continue with
the H-2A program, it needs to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't, we need a new program
that improves the good things,
[SPEAKER_01]: that improves upon the good things that we
already have in the H-2A program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the realities of policy in this
country is that government policy is often
[SPEAKER_01]: based on inertia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the likelihood that we are going to
throw out, completely throw out the H-2A
[SPEAKER_01]: program and start over is pretty slim in
my estimation, which means immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: reform needs to look at what's going right
with the H-2A program, think about what
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be improved, and then come up
with a new guest worker program that will
[SPEAKER_01]: combine those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what agriculture says it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just started the work in the 114th
Congress a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at what happened in the 113th
Congress, the last Congress that ended on
[SPEAKER_01]: July 31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Senate in that Congress passed S-744,
which was a comprehensive immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: reform bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had its own separate agricultural
title, largely because that's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural workers workforce coalition
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, agriculture could
probably have not done much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an opportunity for legalized
status for the undocumented workers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was a new and improved guest
worker program that would make some real
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to the H-2A program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: It then became the House of
Representatives term, turn to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: with this piece of legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year at this time, we knew that the
window, there was a window before the
[SPEAKER_01]: midterm elections right up until about the
August recess.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some bills introduced,
none of them, one was introduced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrats, and it looked just like S-744,
and that was going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other bills introduced by the
Republicans failed to do anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: the 11 million illegal immigrants in this
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, the August
recess came, nothing was done,
[SPEAKER_01]: no bills were passed out of the House.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, President Obama began
threatening and saying, well, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: the House, if the Congress isn't going to
do anything, then I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably only would affect what he did
with his executive action, a small number
[SPEAKER_01]: of workers to make them, allow them
deferred status and deferred detention and
[SPEAKER_01]: deportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see it as having a big impact
on agriculture, and all the organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: that represent agriculture within 24 hours
of the executive action being announced
[SPEAKER_01]: came out and said, this is no substitute,
the executive action is no substitute for
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive immigration reform,
which we still want and are going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us to the new Congress,
the 114th Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the opportunity to be with a group
of farmers who were visiting House members
[SPEAKER_01]: on Capitol Hill two weeks ago,
and it is increasingly apparent to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: the House of Representatives cannot agree
on what to do with the 11 million illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: immigrants, what immigration reform should
look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems unlikely that anything is
going to happen in the 114th Congress
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have the presidential elections
that will be in full swing by the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when we have an election cycle,
it's very hard to get these kinds of tough
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of legislation passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems unlikely to me that we're
going to have much progress or any
[SPEAKER_01]: progress in this Congress, which means
we're probably going to have to wait until
[SPEAKER_01]: we get a new president and another new
Congress and hope at that time that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: get some movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are an apple grower,
if you're a farm manager, how do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about all of this stuff that comes out of
the survey and emanates from the
[SPEAKER_01]: immigration reform process?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, growers, there's no doubt that
growers will continue to improve labor
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new systems have worked great,
and they continue to take out the older
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and the tall trees and put in
these new dwarf trees and these new
[SPEAKER_01]: high-density systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have said in their open-ended
question answers that they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay involved in the immigration reform
legislative process, and I think that if,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have an environment now that if
the organizations like Farm Bureau and
[SPEAKER_01]: others send out a letter that says it is
time to call your congressman,
[SPEAKER_01]: this issue is so important that if there's
a piece of legislation to support or to
[SPEAKER_01]: oppose, those offices will be flooded
because farmers are now paying a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, develop a human resource
strategic plan to include improved wages
[SPEAKER_01]: and benefits, improved housing,
and supervisory training.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that comes out of this
discussion of immigration reform is how do
[SPEAKER_01]: we keep the undocumented workers once they
have a piece of paper that says that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a legalized status?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one of the answers to
that is going to be these three points,
[SPEAKER_01]: the wages, benefits, housing, and
supervisory training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with housing, apple growers have a
leg up over, for example, dairy farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're a big dairy state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apple growers, because of seasonal
labor, already have housing inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dairy farmers don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dairy farmers are going to have,
we still have to be vigilant in the fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, but dairy farmers are going to
have to have a whole new way of thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about their housing and some of the
regulations that may come about because
[SPEAKER_01]: they are less regulated than the growers
are at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I will stop there,
and I think we've got, we stop at 1 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we've got time for some questions and
comments and rebuttals and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did was a lot of things that are
being done today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know farming has changed and Cornell has
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we still doing anything here at
Cornell to have some of our students work
[SPEAKER_03]: in the summers and do the growing process
in, let's say, upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: Champaign Valley, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to my knowledge, but I might not be
the best person to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of internships available
to students, and so those opportunities
[SPEAKER_05]: exist in the form of internships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, both off the campus here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the fruit group right here at
Cornell has five every summer that they
[SPEAKER_05]: come and take them on, and they work on
various aspects of growing fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plantations has interns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I think there are, there's also a
formal course you can take on farm
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment and use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You sign up for a regular course,
and every week, a couple of days a week,
[SPEAKER_05]: you go out and you learn how to drive
tractors and hook up equipment and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the positions for people,
the stem clipping for the, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: the honeycrisp apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the, in New York State,
what is the economic, I mean, I know
[SPEAKER_02]: honeycrisps are a relatively new and also
very high value variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the, what proportion of farms are
growing these high value varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: would actually require that versus
something like a Red Delicious or a Cranny
[SPEAKER_02]: Smith?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not, we did not have enough
information from the survey to answer that
[SPEAKER_01]: question, and I don't know the answer to
that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, the newer varieties keep expanding
and the old varieties keep being replaced.
[SPEAKER_05]: So farmers as a whole in general tend to
be conservative politically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And folks that are sort of pushing for,
you know, slowing down, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: no path to citizenship and no amnesty and
all that are also politically
[SPEAKER_05]: conservative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there seems to be, there must be some
tension between those two groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the nature of that conversation
between the politically conservative
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians and the politically
conservative farmer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it different than what we hear as sort
of the general public?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the farmer say to the
politician?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who seems to be working against their
interest in this particular case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, that is a fascinating
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you what happened two weeks ago
when we were on Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, so I went with a group of growers and
we went to five or six house members'
[SPEAKER_01]: office and usually end up talking to the
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of those congressmen are new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you have to start at the
beginning and say why all this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them, like Tom Reed and others
have been around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Collins, and they've heard this from
the same growers for several years
[SPEAKER_01]: running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you don't have to educate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it's likely that one of the
growers will say, well, so what do you,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us really what you think is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things we heard was,
and this is a quote from one of the staff
[SPEAKER_01]: members, was there are two dozen
knuckleheads in Congress, in the House,
[SPEAKER_01]: that do not want anything, want to do
anything with the 11 million undocumented
[SPEAKER_01]: immigrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have that small group that is
very vocal and very dug in and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find the middle for the Republicans has
been very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that help to answer the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, the, if you're Tom Reed or
Chris Collins and you come from an upstate
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural district, you get,
and you know that the farmers are not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get off your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to, these conservatives
and trying to get something going and the
[SPEAKER_01]: conservatives are having, are just staying
dug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to Marvin's question, the argument
isn't ideological.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's between those in agriculture who want
them to do something and the Republicans
[SPEAKER_00]: who can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they end up explaining why it can't be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, and we have to remember
politically that those House members who
[SPEAKER_01]: are taking that that hands off,
we don't want to do anything on
[SPEAKER_01]: immigration approach or anything for the
illegal immigrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from districts whose electorate
want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while Chris Collins' electorate wants
this moving for agriculture, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: another person, a conservative Republican
in a conservative Republican district who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't, who wants the same thing that
that House member is saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering on that point we have down
there on that last slide, whether they're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking to current employers like
McDonald's that trains a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_04]: supervisory training as a source of labor
or crew chiefs or anything along those
[SPEAKER_04]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you, I'm not sure I completely
understand the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we stand to hire some workers away
from McDonald's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so it's not immigrant labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working at sort of similar wages
and they have some training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there is a difference between
outdoor work and working in the elements
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and working at McDonald's,
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, it gets back to this whole
question of will Americans do these jobs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a feeling that there are
probably some McDonald's managers who
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder the same thing if Americans would
do those jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at these low labor levels, I think
we're gonna continue to struggle with how
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the workers and get them trained
and compensate them to get the work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't see much movement between
a job like McDonald's and an apple
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard, but I do see both employers
having the same challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one thing, we always take it for
granted that H2A is an oppressive program
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've explained the fact that it's
difficult for employers why is it that
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't it built to provide that stable
workforce that everybody wants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a large part of the reason is that
when laws like this are enacted,
[SPEAKER_01]: the labor advocates have had something to
say about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are assurances put into the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the paperwork is part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the wages are part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labor advocates have said,
the workers need more than what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to give and so they compromise on
something that does have higher wages and
[SPEAKER_01]: more restrictions along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think we're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
