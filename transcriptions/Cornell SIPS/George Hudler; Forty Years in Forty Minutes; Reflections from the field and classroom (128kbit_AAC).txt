[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our speaker today really needs no
introduction, but we're going to give one
[SPEAKER_00]: anyhow, George.
[SPEAKER_00]: But George is not a conventional scientist
here, so we'll give a little
[SPEAKER_00]: unconventional introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'd like to share with you,
he's actually giving his own autobiography
[SPEAKER_00]: today, entitled 40 Years and 40 Minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I thought we'd do to kind of get
the thing started is read some excerpts
[SPEAKER_00]: that stands us from a wonderful poem some
of your peers wrote for your retirement
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't read the whole thing,
but this was put together by a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, including Sandra Jensen,
Don Daly O'Brien, Sean Connelly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, George, an ode to George
Hudler.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a bright sunny day, a young man from
Ploquet, through a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: did peer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had found his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: A world full of fungi was just right for
this fun guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With studies completed after a spell,
he was off to a job, a career at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pests of shrubs and trees,
he's our specialist in disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that that are surely no doubt this
co-editor of Branching Out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three courses he's taught over the years
and short courses with various peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For his teaching style, we must say this,
is a treat future students will miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 20 plus years teaching mushrooms so
magical, George may have seemed somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: fanatical while planning this year-end
final feast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a tribute to mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this man who came from Minnesota,
who said plant disease makes my mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: water, has taught us that mushrooms are
magic and that toadstools can sometimes be
[SPEAKER_00]: tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might not be aware, it was while
George was plant-packed chair that cheers
[SPEAKER_00]: with your peers for his brought us
Thursday beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Hudler has often been here to take
part in departmental cheer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has encouraged camaraderie and shared
much hilarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years after retiring,
when fishing and golf ceased to be firing,
[SPEAKER_00]: of neurons so used to mental exercise,
it might not come as a surprise if George
[SPEAKER_00]: might just start to hanker to see some
lethal bleeding beach canker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or wish he could find some inoculum of
that elitism of Americanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: George has received awards aplenty for
both education and arborist society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent in teaching has marked his
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so glad that he chose to teach here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after an illustrious career that
concludes in his 39th year, we might hope
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd stay just one more and make it an
even two score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're getting our wish because
if I'm not mistaken, this marks into your
[SPEAKER_00]: 40th season at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, George Hudler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now I got to turn on number two
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks to you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really a treat for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that this might actually
come to pass, an exit seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've enjoyed the opportunity to put it
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to start out with a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I gave the title to somebody,
I said 40 years and 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more like it's going to be closer
to 40 years and 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might as well settle in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to tell you that what I didn't
expect when I started to put all this
[SPEAKER_01]: together was how much it was going to cost
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, when you're retired, you get a
free end parking permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you the right to park in
these flex zones down by the loading dock
[SPEAKER_01]: for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened to me in the last
several weeks is I got so preoccupied with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the stuff that I had to go through
and enjoying every minute of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am today, 14 days and three
tickets and $90 later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the only reason I'm glad this
is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my career in plant pathology started at
the University of Minnesota near the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of my junior year when I had to take a
course in forest pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been told the details of that
pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first day many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to repeat it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be sure, it marked a profound
change in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the short space of 48 hours,
I went from a very young man with no real
[SPEAKER_01]: aspirations to a life with a new awareness
of the potential of biology to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: important answers to important questions
that needed answers right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gave a purpose to my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person who started it all was this
man, Dave French.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught that forest pathology course and
he lit a fire under me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He not only took me under his wing,
but he did so with a subtle but very clear
[SPEAKER_01]: message that he had confidence that I
could succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time in my life, I really
needed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the product of a colorful line of
plant pathologists including Clyde
[SPEAKER_01]: Christensen, who wrote the book The Molds
in Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing what has happened to me over
the years, he won't be surprised to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: that Clyde had an important role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was E.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakeman, a contemporary of H.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wetzel and the most solid pillar in the
foundation of our discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakeman was 88 the last time I gave a
seminar in our department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on seminar day, as the clock moved
agonizingly slowly toward the 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: start time, I, as all other graduate
students, would have one eye on the back
[SPEAKER_01]: door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where Stakeman would appear like Moses on
the mount if he was going to be there that
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he did, he'd take up a seat near
the front of the lecture room,
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe dangling from his mouth, his head
nodded as if enjoying an afternoon nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then near the end of the talk,
just when you thought the job was done,
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakeman would stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd open his eyes and he'd start to ask
questions that might last for another
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one dared to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the poor student in the front of the
room had an abbreviated but very public A
[SPEAKER_01]: exam.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Stakeman probed every nook and cranny
of that seminar topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an incredibly character building
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never even began to appreciate at
the time how it would influence me over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does make me shiver to recount the
tale now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning in the company of those three
men and my fellow graduate students at
[SPEAKER_01]: Minnesota just brought a breath of fresh
air to my academic life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And together with my colleagues,
we all just came to enjoy learning more
[SPEAKER_01]: and teaching each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I even began to think I might
have the wherewithal to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: productive thinker at some point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not quite sure I've reached this
stature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But much as I loved Minnesota and
especially the ranch plant pathological
[SPEAKER_01]: history, the early 70s was a time for
people my age to see the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I chose to land at Colorado State
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was there to continue my studies
under the direction of Frank Hawksworth,
[SPEAKER_01]: an icon in his own right for his
foundational research on a group of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic plants called dwarf mistletoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things, mistletoes had a very
unique seed dispersal mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pressure would build up in ripe berries,
each berry containing a single seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the pressure was relieved,
the seeds would shoot out of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: squirt out of there at speeds over 60
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would easily travel 20 meters or
more through the air, hoping to land on
[SPEAKER_01]: another susceptible tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job was to determine whether or not
birds could be important vectors for
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroducing the sticky seeds of the
pathogen to areas that had been clear cut
[SPEAKER_01]: to eradicate the original infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years in the examination of
literally hundreds of birds and thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of bird droppings, I concluded that their
role in spreading the disease was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not worth enough concern to
change management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, eradication is still the
most successful approach to this really
[SPEAKER_01]: very serious group of plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of life lessons, and I'm
going to intersperse periodically here
[SPEAKER_01]: with life lessons, one for me was that
confidence grows confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that confidence that Dave French
expressed in me that made me more
[SPEAKER_01]: confident in myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that experience just resonated time
and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I vowed at the time that whenever I
had an opportunity to work with students
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, I would do my best not to just
dictate what they do, but to try to convey
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence that I had that they could do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an important thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second of all, that teachers are at their
best when they're teaching from personal
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, I saw this in spades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it kind of dawned on me, I watched
various professors teaching things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were teaching from the book,
when they were teaching from papers that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else wrote, there was one layer
of enthusiasm, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they got to what they were doing,
it just ratcheted up completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole, it electrified the
classroom every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I vowed then as well to try to put
together as many of my own stories as I
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures really are worth 1,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't much of a photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I began to approach this new,
to me, science of plant pathology,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was obvious that if I was going to
share my message with people who weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with it, it would be so much more
effective to do it with pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've got thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure what I'm going to do with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, growing old doesn't have
to mean growing stale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my example of that was Clyde
Christensen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I met him, he was in his mid-70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had been retired about 10, 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he showed up at the plant pathology
department every morning, Monday through
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday, 8 o'clock, with a bounce in his
step, a twinkle in his eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought you were seeing a little kid
coming downstairs to a new Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: He zoomed off to his lab, puttered away
there the rest of the day, and came out
[SPEAKER_01]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I watched all that unfold,
I thought, you know, George, maybe getting
[SPEAKER_01]: old isn't going to be so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I saw an advertisement as I was
finishing up in Colorado for a job out in
[SPEAKER_01]: a place called Cornell in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got on a plane and fully expected
that when I opened the window,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we got closer, this is what I was going
to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just to give you an indication
of how little I knew of what was going on
[SPEAKER_01]: east of the Mississippi River.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pleasantly surprised to,
in fact, find this instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the water and the trees and the
kinds of things that were so familiar to
[SPEAKER_01]: my life in Minnesota that I figured that
this was a place that I could make home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I obviously have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things, I was taken under the
wing of this man, Wayne Sinclair,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was an incredible mentor for me at the
time and has proven to be that and an
[SPEAKER_01]: important advisor even today, as well as a
very good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of embarrassed that this is
the best picture I have of Wayne in my
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on retrospect, I thought, well,
maybe it isn't so bad, because I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: count the number of times he kept me from
going off the deep end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe this was all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also came into, conveniently,
there was a raging epidemic of a disease
[SPEAKER_01]: called sclerodaris canker going on in
conifer forests up in the Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was able to get some funding to
begin research on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disease itself, it was affected both
forest trees, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: for my purposes, Christmas trees,
which were part of my responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It caused a twig blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in and of itself, we wouldn't worry
too much about that, except that when an
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculum from one twig would then go to
others and others and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it quickly snowballed until all the
twigs were killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the growing points quilled,
then trees began to die, and they died by
[SPEAKER_01]: the thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was quite alarming.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were concerned about just what was
going on there, what might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, what would happen if
the disease got out of its current range,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was in the Adirondack region,
especially on cut Christmas trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it were spread to other conifer
forests in other parts of the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they set up a quarantine measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my graduate student and I at the time
were set with trying to figure out just
[SPEAKER_01]: how big and how realistic the threat
really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time all was said and done,
we had kind of concluded that for a number
[SPEAKER_01]: of different reasons related to climate,
related to inoculum load and other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: that this probably wasn't the threat that
it was originally perceived to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we reached that conclusion,
others did as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money dried up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we moved on to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, yeah, so that was kind of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the odd thing was that when people
quit paying attention to sclerodaris,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just went away all by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even today, nobody knows why.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were going to show you, try to show
students a sample of sclerodaris canker,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go up to the old spots we used to
work on, and I know I can't find one damn
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't take any credit for it,
although given the chance, we probably
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what were the life lessons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ecosystems can be inexplicably resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once in a while, if you just let them
go, they'll take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you can do this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't count on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is that good science can
sometimes defy replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we needed to do was
produce a lot of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried and tried and tried to get
our pathogen to produce spores and
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that damn thing just would not
cooperate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day, one of Bill Fry's
post-docs wandered down the hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, we're using this
concoction down there to grow P.
[SPEAKER_01]: infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you throw some VHUs and some
other stuff in there and give it a try?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of the week, we had spores
flying out of our petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the most incredible thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the next two years, we had all the
spores we could possibly need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to conduct some very
interesting experiments and get done what
[SPEAKER_01]: we needed to get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But toward the end, thank God,
we were almost done because our incubator
[SPEAKER_01]: died.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of these tabletop
incubators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are others kicking around the
apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just crank one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the same temperature,
the same photo period, near as we could
[SPEAKER_01]: tell the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those cultures would not reproduce one
damn spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it continued like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I mention this is that
I have no reservation whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_01]: no loss of confidence in the work we did
and the work we published.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody today was to take our
methods and try to do it, it probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reason that I bring this
up now is that right now, you may or not
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware of the fact that there's an
effort to reproduce a half dozen or so
[SPEAKER_01]: critical experiments in cancer research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two of the first three have failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how easy it is for people to point to
the researchers and say, aha, we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate your efforts, so your work must
not be any good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd be a little reluctant to jump on
that bandwagon yet because there are these
[SPEAKER_01]: subtle things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody who's here from
Geneva but I think Wayne Sinclair had a
[SPEAKER_01]: student who had the same deal,
didn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trying to produce spores of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day, the student, I don't remember
how it went, but he ran up the stairs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Barton Hall and then ran back down and put
the plates back on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sporulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weird things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just really makes me more nervous
than ever to think we would just write off
[SPEAKER_01]: things because they can't be immediately
replicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other thing, of course,
is that when interacting with the press,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to choose every word with
enormous care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any chance, write it
rather than say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with the interest in
Christmas trees and people frantic about
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going to happen to the trees and
the presents underneath and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: other, this fungus that was on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some radio interviews and some
newspaper articles written after phone
[SPEAKER_01]: calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, what I thought I said and what I
read later that day or heard on the news
[SPEAKER_01]: later that night, in fact, even the CBS
Evening News one night, I just shuddered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have done, I had a lot of
interaction with the press, but boy,
[SPEAKER_01]: I tread very, very lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, while the Christmas tree
growers were interested in my activities
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything, there was another audience
down in southeast New York that had
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous concern with my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interest in my work because my job
included extension on woody ornamentals of
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, down in southeast New
York, in the metropolitan New York area
[SPEAKER_01]: and the counties around there,
tree care and plant health care management
[SPEAKER_01]: is incredibly lucrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also incredibly competitive,
almost to a level of stories that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might hear in The Godfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, the guys that are
involved, the people that are involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: that are very, very smart and they're very
well connected with the political
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to work with them,
they have no time for idle speculation or
[SPEAKER_01]: random BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want answers to their questions right
now or they want assurance that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with those answers in short order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the carrot, or if you call it that,
maybe the stick at the end of the carrot
[SPEAKER_01]: was that if they became dissatisfied with
the service they got, it might find its
[SPEAKER_01]: way back to the state legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was an enormous challenge for me as
a little, hick guy from the middle America
[SPEAKER_01]: to come in and immerse myself in this
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I managed to make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, some of the best friends I have
in the arboricultural industry are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I reflect back and I gotta think
that whoever wrote, if you can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you'll make it anywhere,
they started out like I did from someplace
[SPEAKER_01]: else because it was quite a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The life lessons, though, in terms of this
emphasis on extension, is that for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: standalone extension work can be
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to share information that people
really needed to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was challenged to provide answers to
problems on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Steakman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to sharpen my own analytical skills
on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, French.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn from people who see your
patients every hour of every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not have the academic
background you have, but they have
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in spades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put those two things
together, I think that they pay off in all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the liability for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension audiences are very content,
in most cases, if you just tell them what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is and how to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, that got to be an intellectual
liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually applauded for the good
advice I gave, and I kinda seduced by this
[SPEAKER_01]: warm feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't until I took on some new
responsibilities teaching Plant Path 443,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathology and Entomology of Trees and
Shrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a collaborative effort with a
fellow in entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was here, picking up a course that
Wayne Sinclair had taught, where he had
[SPEAKER_01]: taken, purposely took his students well
beyond just what is it and how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted them to know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And among other things, I think he wanted
them, because they were paying a good
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of money and they were
intellectually capable, he wanted them to
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch their imagination and know why
things were going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I picked up that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using Wayne's foundation, I was able to
pick this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found myself wanting to be able to
answer those same questions in my own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I spent a lot of hours here,
with the wee hours of the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: putting together presentations,
not just lectures, but visuals as well
[SPEAKER_01]: that would help me to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could just sense myself then growing
in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, that why and answering those
questions then began to filter back to my
[SPEAKER_01]: extension audiences in such a way that
they then, and they began to appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, I'm sure they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I swear today, or even as that grew,
that they became more inquisitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually became more challenging to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they became more effective in
the field because now they also had been
[SPEAKER_01]: stretched beyond that limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So teaching challenged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there were a number of topics that I
wasn't, even though I was supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: tree pathologist, a number of topics that
I had to learn to be fluent with,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always on the lookout for these
personal experiences that I could use as
[SPEAKER_01]: springboards to convey my message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just maybe to expose new paradigm
shifts that collude into discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have time to develop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me tell you one other thing that
I'm kind of getting off my script here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't planned to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the other things is that at the
time, I was teaching, a good proportion of
[SPEAKER_01]: the students who took this course had
gotten the first two years of their
[SPEAKER_01]: college at a community college or a state
school somewhere else in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they came to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they transferred in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't have the basic biology and
even basic botany that students who
[SPEAKER_01]: started at Cornell might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to find a way to kind of
bring them up to speed without slowing the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the class down, but also in a way
that didn't single them out as deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, I don't think
anybody really even knew the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: because I kind of snuck it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody, in relatively short order,
could move intellectually forward then as
[SPEAKER_01]: a cohesive group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was actually pretty proud of the way
that all worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now I do have to get to my script.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one extension trip took me,
in 1980, I went on to Rockland County to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to the Rockland County Arborist
Association in the evening talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the title of my talk was Tree Diseases
Review and Preview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you, I gave a lot of talks with
that title.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was such a convenient talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so the association secretary,
who had a bit of a reputation for matching
[SPEAKER_01]: each page of minutes with a stout martini,
recorded the events this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, the speaker spoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest, speaking on diseases of woody
plants and how to cure them, gave a
[SPEAKER_01]: seemingly erudite talk in a splendid
manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really a charming young man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only time will tell whether or not he's
full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened the floor to questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was as if people never heard a word
I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they wanted to talk about was,
what's wrong with the dogwoods?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture shows snow on the
hillside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I had come down from Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still had snow up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dogwoods were blooming down in
southeast New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I could see at the time was,
I don't have any idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll stay on for another day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can look around and see what we
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, something unusual was
happening with flowering dogwoods in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lansing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The damage started out as leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it kind of morphed into a twig
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally into the death of entire
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem seemed to be confined to just
a relatively small area in Westchester
[SPEAKER_01]: County and another area near Oyster Bay
out on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in those areas, there were a lot of
dead and dying dogwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: People count on them, like robins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They count on those dogwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're not there, it's painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I looked closely, as close as I
could at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought samples back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a fungus, a coelomycete of some
sort, producing minute pycnidia and even
[SPEAKER_01]: minuter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to use it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever was there looked like 100 other
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow on the twigs of dogwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wasn't immediately obvious to me
that there was anything special about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of took it all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of, a little bit with that
sclerodaris episode in my background,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, I'm not sure what's
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's kind of a confluence of
environment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some kind of a wave year of
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this happens now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get an outbreak of some disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go for one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it kind of subsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, just relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think things will be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, it covered there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it went right up to Hudson
Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through the whole doggone state
of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upon closer examination by mycologists
actually at Beltsville, they discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: that this disease was new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they decided to call the disease
dogwood anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pathogen was completely new to
science, aptly deemed discula destructiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these pictures were typical of dogwood
anthracnose when I first ran into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it occurs throughout the range of
flowering dogwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you might expect, there are a few
survivors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some entrepreneur spots those and
chooses to propagate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably, in all intents and
purposes, resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be where the next
generation comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, you'd be hard pressed to buy
a flowering dogwood from any commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery in the eastern US and maybe in the
whole United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtually everything looks like flowering
dogwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually a hybrid between
Cornice, Florida, and then an Oriental
[SPEAKER_01]: dogwood that does have the resistance
that's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly enough, I don't think
anyone knows the difference except the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are making the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the life lessons, well, first of all,
you're never as damn smart as you think
[SPEAKER_01]: you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just admit it, people will
respect your humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was kind of an important
crossword for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had taken some other tack,
I might have eroded confidence in that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole audience for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of told a story just like I'm
telling it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did blow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see it coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time it became apparent,
we also knew that the thing had spread
[SPEAKER_01]: like wildfire across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if there was a fungicide that might
have been used, the horse was already well
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing, and just to reinforce
that then, but by admitting that and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even putting a little bit of levity but
serious levity into it, I think I was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to maintain the confidence of the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is that high levels of
international traffic through New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State provides enormous potential for
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply can't relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I taught plant disease diagnosis,
I always told the students, I'd give them
[SPEAKER_01]: an unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, now the first thing you do
with this, don't culture it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't run PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put Jalisa back in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up a damn book and read.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we know about this plant and its
problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chances are 999 out of 1,000 that
the answer is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least when you start spending money
and time on expensive tests, you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: some firmer direction to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say 999 out of 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now in New York State, I'm thinking
more like 99 out of 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so much junk comes in,
and you see this in the paper almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: month, something new is coming in the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't relax in a place like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then with the dog, we're interacting
with a story kind of in the back of my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: These samples showed up on my desk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Norway maple with big black
blotches on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at that and I said, you know,
that looks like a disease I know on red
[SPEAKER_01]: and silver maple called tar spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the books, and by golly,
they all said, yeah, tar spot occurs on
[SPEAKER_01]: Norway maple as red as well as these
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's that common, we've had Norway
maples in this country for hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why haven't we seen it before?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I accepted what I read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote to the extension agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, this turns out to be tar
spot caused by Ritizma acerinum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know, it's photogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great classroom specimen,
but it doesn't do any damage whatsoever to
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then about a month later,
I got a call from this guy, George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that sample I say, oh,
yeah, jeez, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember you said it wasn't going to cause
any problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, maybe you ought to come out
here and see the problem it isn't causing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got in the car and I went up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like somebody had driven
down the streets of that town with a
[SPEAKER_01]: flamethrower and fried every Norway maple
from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that caused me to think, well,
George, maybe you goofed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I began to take a closer look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We followed this over the course of a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those spots on the Norway maple would lay
on the ground all winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the spring, they would open up,
split open little fissures and out would
[SPEAKER_01]: come ascospores like little javelins fly
up in the air just at the time when the
[SPEAKER_01]: new Norway maple leaves are coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Infection would occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years it would be worse than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it was bad, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pictures like this were common,
but they only happened about once every
[SPEAKER_01]: six or seven years when all the weather
conditions, inoculum load, and others came
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even had a glorious outbreak right here
in Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wouldn't believe the most
chemophobic people in town were calling me
[SPEAKER_01]: up wondering, what can we spray to save
our trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are other people in
horticulture who say, if it's Norway
[SPEAKER_01]: maple, let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that's another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we hooked up with a
fellow out at the US Forest Products Lab
[SPEAKER_01]: in Madison and concluded that,
in fact, this fungus on Norway maple was
[SPEAKER_01]: not the same one on red maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly enough, the fungus on
Norway maple, described by Frieze hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of years ago, was the real Ritizma
acerinum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one on red maple and silver maple
that we thought we knew well was a
[SPEAKER_01]: different fungus previously known.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually undescribed in the
scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up calling it Ritizma
americanum because it did seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat unique to the North American
continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people said, George,
you blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you call it Ritizma huddlerii
and get your name in the literature?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was drawn back to a story Dave
French used to tell about a colleague of
[SPEAKER_01]: his named Professor Weir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Professor Weir had a graduate student
working on a wood decay fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: new to science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in honor of his professor,
he named it Polyperus wirianus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, no, I'm probably better off
not getting into the.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stuck with americanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you know there were people
who said this decries the American
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, well, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So life lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I told you, you weren't so damn
smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is that respect
previous work, but don't trust it to
[SPEAKER_01]: override gut instincts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think no matter what the literature
says, it's a good place to start thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't let it necessarily dictate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then see a teachable moment for what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the process of trying to get people to
settle down about this tar spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for sure to prevent them or discourage
them from getting up and driving down a
[SPEAKER_01]: street, spraying fungicides 60 feet into
the air up one street and down the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to describe how, in fact,
this disease was not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had little or no impact on tree
survival or health, because the damage was
[SPEAKER_01]: so late in the growing season that the
tree could cope with all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just didn't make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also then would go on to say,
you know, it's like a lot of other leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, like apple scab and powdery
mildew and anthracnose and a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of threw the back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling the public at large,
and the industry, that a lot of these leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases that you're controlling really
probably don't need to be controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I had come out and said that
straight away, the guys in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: said, what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go broke if we don't have a
chance to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: But kind of sneaking through the back door
this way seemed to pay off.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let me move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last episode in the instance I want to
show is our work with European beets.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a majestic tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, native in Europe and planted in
the US back or started in North America
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the mid-1800s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a big flurry between 1870
and 1900 when a lot of these trees were
[SPEAKER_01]: planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Majestic trees, large crowns, branching
just made them really desirable,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially at places like aristocratic
mansions and cemeteries, parks,
[SPEAKER_01]: college campuses is where they first
showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were so popular, they continued
to be planted a lot up to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is this large cohort of trees
that's between 100 and 150 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so among other things, in addition to
just being valuable and the death of these
[SPEAKER_01]: trees and the landscape was sad for people
who loved their trees, the other thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: that these sometimes had enormous impact
on property values.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this estate, this house, which is a
one-family home on Long Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: had four European beets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see two of them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were two on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a real estate appraiser in that area
told me, and I have no reason to doubt
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that if those four trees died,
the value of this property would be
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced by $6 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four European beets trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because collectively, they framed this
view of the New York City skyline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with them gone, all of a sudden,
that would open this up and change things
[SPEAKER_01]: completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know how reliable,
maybe that guy overestimated, but even if
[SPEAKER_01]: it was half that much, it was a tremendous
impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that I would get these
phone calls from people who, you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: come, my European beets tree is dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this began almost from the first year
I was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continued periodically along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I got there, the trees were
almost dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bark was falling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were saprobic fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was wood rotters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing I could do but kind
of say the last rites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of discouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was nothing else I could do or
think to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day I was at this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tree that was of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the left half is pretty well
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right half looks better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, this is all one tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you got to the bottom,
the bark was falling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just a little strip of live bark
that was carrying any one amount of water
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients from the roots of the shoots and
carbohydrates the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of, ah, jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was putzing around here,
I noticed that there was this copse of
[SPEAKER_01]: trees on the backyard that were in some
state of decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some looked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually, I think, three or four
trees altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wandered over there for the
heck of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at the base of the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found this thing, which we know in
the tree world as a bleeding canker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also know that sometimes these are
caused by phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so for whatever reason, and listen,
this was total serendipity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to have an electric drill in my
trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happened to have a brand new test
kit for diagnosing phytophthora in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field with ELISA technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got out the drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any alcohol to sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did have a bottle of gin in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sterilized the drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drilled into the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught the shavings that came out on
aluminum foil that also was sterilized
[SPEAKER_01]: with the gin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ran it through this ELISA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't you know, it turned out
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the positive negative control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that observation all by itself
launched a research program that went on
[SPEAKER_01]: for the next seven or eight years as we
learned more and more about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to run through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things is that once we knew to
look for those bleeding cankers,
[SPEAKER_01]: irrespective of what was going on in the
crown, to look for those bleeding cankers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we found out this was far more prevalent
than we'd ever imagined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between 25% and 40% of the trees have
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we've got one right out here in
men's gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put it there, but I'm glad I'm
retired and don't have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, it's an extremely common thing,
especially among this 100 to 150-year-old
[SPEAKER_01]: cohort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that all of this has a bit to
do with just flat out old age.
[SPEAKER_01]: We originally concluded that the pathogen
might be Phytophthora cetricola.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we learned Phytophthora cetricola
was a complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other people in the world
working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, our primary pathogen
turned out to be Phytophthora pinii,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was an obscure Phytophthora isolated
from the roots of some pine tree in
[SPEAKER_01]: northern Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of just drifted off into the
hinterlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now with DNA sequencing and the like,
this turned out to be our major pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also had P. cactorum, Cambivora,
and gonopidetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, pinii was the primary pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, there were other
Phytophthoras involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is, we isolated the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to, you know, we had this all
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never actually proved Cox-Postas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people are standing around
saying, oh, yeah, come and inoculate my
[SPEAKER_01]: elegant tree for the sake of science,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day, I learned, a friend of
mine had looked at the campus master plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, hey, this tree down by
Rockefeller, down the hill below
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockefeller Hall, they're going to be
taking that out as part of the development
[SPEAKER_01]: of the new physical science building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can work on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gave the grounds crew a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy in the assistant manager says,
oh, you don't want to touch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing was planted in honor of the
class of 1961 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, you don't want to get a bunch of
alumni mad at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, OK, that's too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then about a month later, I ran into the
director of the grounds crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at another function.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up behind him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, hey, Dennis, he turned around
without a, he says, George, I'm so sorry I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't answer that email.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tree's going to go any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can inoculate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Jerry Weil in my postdoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had spore suspensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drilled holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put more dams up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I topped it in that tree, then you
could shake a stick at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the way back up, we're walking
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about halfway back to plant
science building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know what, Jerry, the funny
thing is Dennis said we could even
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant that thing if we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dennis went, there's Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on my right shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he stopped and I turned.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, oh, my God, I've been talking to
the grounds crew true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just inoculated the wrong tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, we could go back and
put alcohol in the holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was feeling kind of punchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, let's just let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the next two and a half years,
I drove by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, please don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one splendid morning,
I came on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here was Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here was the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The construction was about ready to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tree had been cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stump was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Jerry again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came down with mallets and chisels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stripped all the bark off that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't you know, every infection
site was dead on a doornail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We isolated the same fungus that we put in
on each one of the root flares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I was concerned,
we had a real pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Professor Cock wouldn't probably quite
approve of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it made me OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we learned from
colleagues in the west who were working on
[SPEAKER_01]: another phytophthora that this phosphonate
fungicides might prove to help control
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it didn't work that well for
them, it worked incredibly well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has become standard procedure for
treating these trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've prolonged the lives literally of
thousands of beech trees in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_01]: with this treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the life lesson is, well, just keep
plugging away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your logic is sound and you just keep
your eyes open, then sometimes dumb luck
[SPEAKER_01]: will save you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing else,
with nothing to lose, cut to the chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say this, when we decided to
start using this fungicide, we could have
[SPEAKER_01]: spent another decade trying to unravel all
the intricacies of the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't want to wait 10 years while
people's trees are dying hand over fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went ahead with this fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just happened to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't have time to tell some of the
hairy sides of that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do say do this all carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so some of you are probably wondering,
Jesus, the thing is almost over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hasn't said anything about the
magical mushroom course yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's because I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because that's a story in and of
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the groundwork for that story was laid
with all these life lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned how to communicate with various
oddities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the value of personal stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the parts came together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned to think on my feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when finally came time for me to begin
to put that course together, I could hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly had to work my tail off to
catch up on a number of topics that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know much about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could do so with confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the only thing that made the
biggest difference, though, was I had an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible array of graduate students and
staff members to help with it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have one big regret, it's that
every year I didn't get my TAs together
[SPEAKER_01]: and take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even today, I was trying to
remember who was involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I looked at pictures, these are a
few of the key people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you recognize the white hat in the
center because she's taken over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to cut to my script.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I move to conclusion,
I want to speak directly now to the
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Graduates and graduate students,
postdocs, because you're the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to shape the future of science
and science education for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with children and grandchildren of my
own who are going to be on the receiving
[SPEAKER_01]: end of that education, I'm concerned about
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: At issue for me is that the scientific
community just doesn't seem to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the job it needs to do to teach people who
aren't part of that community what they
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confidence in science and scientists seems
in my mind to be falling a little too
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly and perhaps dangerously low levels
among too much of the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the ultimate
consequences of all this will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think it's worthwhile to see the
problem and to be thinking about these
[SPEAKER_01]: things with an eye toward turning the
tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you a couple of examples of
what the public sees in the way of
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, guidelines for healthy blood
pressure levels gleaned from study after
[SPEAKER_01]: study after study is that if you have
hypertension, you should be shooting for
[SPEAKER_01]: 140 over 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the last year or so, a
meta-analysis of data from all these
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that arrived at this other
conclusion has now caused doctors or
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists to say, medical professionals
to say that the target should be 120 over
[SPEAKER_01]: 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the frustration of hypertension
patients they must be experiencing as they
[SPEAKER_01]: learn that the goal they worked so hard
for is now all for not with the stroke of
[SPEAKER_01]: a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they tried to get
clarification, I can tell you there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: one physician in a thousand has a faintest
damned idea what a meta-analysis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're no impossible in no
position to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of go along with the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not surprised at the
frustration with other things as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: like recommendations for getting
mammograms, like the safety of artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: sweeteners, like the value of PSA levels
for predicting prostate cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and myriad other guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientific community in the public eye
just can't seem to make their eye up,
[SPEAKER_01]: mind up, and here's another example.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you know why Pluto is not a
planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I looked that up last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to figure out why isn't it a
planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost everything I read focused more
on the scientific community patting
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves on the back for making the
declaration than for explaining why.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was stunned to see this picture
as part of a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a frame off of a video that is
advertised as a clear and concise
[SPEAKER_01]: description of how a scientific community
arrived, what the data is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this is a picture of?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of some of the most
prominent astronomers in the world in 19,
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2006, holding yellow pieces of paper up
in the air at the 26th General Assembly of
[SPEAKER_01]: the International Astronomical Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're voting on the definition of a
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2006, scientists have sent telescopes
to the far reach of the galaxy,
[SPEAKER_01]: put thousands of satellites in orbit,
sent men to the moon, and taught millions
[SPEAKER_01]: of eager young minds about the excitement
of science, and they still can't figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what a planet is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this vote didn't seal the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my same search, I found some newer
articles and new, like, 16 hours old that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a prominent group of people that
want to recount.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to do this again because they're
not convinced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now look, you and I know that one of the
casualties of scientific inquiry is that
[SPEAKER_01]: new knowledge displaces the old,
and with it, paradigms change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't do a better job of
explaining that to more people who don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the process, then I think we
leave ourselves open to mistrust,
[SPEAKER_01]: ridicule, and humiliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One solution seems to be to appeal to the
scientific community is to teach people to
[SPEAKER_01]: think like a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is that enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, by a long shot, I think what has
much greater promise is to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists to talk to that increasingly
large portion of our population who have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen snippets of controversies debated in
the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been swayed by irrational but
elegant rhetoric, and they're often on the
[SPEAKER_01]: short end of the economic stick,
but they're looking for anybody and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to blame their problems on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fervently hope that some of you in
this room will accept the challenge to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to those skeptics on their terms
with the same enthusiasm and creativity
[SPEAKER_01]: that you bring to your science.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you gotta do it with compassion,
you gotta do it with humility,
[SPEAKER_01]: and anything else it'll take to begin to
restore that confidence that people used
[SPEAKER_01]: to have in the academy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got one last thing to say,
and then I'll shut up, and that is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing my plea causes you to say to
yourself, oh, he means we have to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: better job of dumbing it down,
then you are not the person to speak for
[SPEAKER_01]: the academy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That phrase is demeaning, it's
counterproductive in every possible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so subjective that I can't
believe it comes out of the mouths of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same people who pride themselves on the
objectivity of their profession.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, every time I hear that phrase,
I picture the speaker standing out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field with a shovel in their hand,
pushing down on that spade to dig the hole
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already standing in deeper so that
they'll never get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way or another, I think we can do
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that phrase is in your lexicon,
then I implore you to just plain stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need a catchy phrase to keep your
juices flowing, try this one instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be happier, I'll be happier,
and we'll all have a far better chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: making the lives of future generations
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
