[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, no, I'll be brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's my pleasure to introduce
the topic today being presented by Starr,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage, Greg, and Matthew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working with the Innovation
Lab for Crop Improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really kind of engaged in
interacting with them since the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the stated goals of the Innovation
Lab for Crop Improvement is to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, technologies, and methodologies for
crop improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, developing these tools,
technologies, and methodologies is
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But developing these TTMs that are
actually adopted and have real meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: impact in a breeding program is incredibly
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to really track the impact
that these tools are having can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenging endeavor, especially when
dealing with large and complex research
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations like a lot of the NARS that
we're partnering with ILC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been great working with this team
because they're bringing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise that we don't really have,
certainly in the plant breedings and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics section.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been able to put together some
great surveys that help us get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding on really how these programs
operate, what some of these baselines are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really just incredibly
important information as we try and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually develop collaborations that are
going to be impactful with these
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations and try and track and learn
from how these tools are being used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd just like to thank
everyone for presenting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really looking forward to this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a quick outline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sage, Greg, and myself are going to have
three parts of today's presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk a little bit of context,
objective of these surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will give you two overviews,
the methodologies and some of the findings
[SPEAKER_01]: from the two of the surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, originally I was going to put
three surveys and I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tomorrow I'm going to present that in
the live meeting with Kelly and Guar's
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will cover my recent interviews
with all the area objective leads.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today only the two surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, we'll share some of the
learnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, mainly for discussion very
informal and then entertain your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for ourselves, we are planning the
next phase of the grant proposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot to learn from the discussion as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the quick begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CTIR and NARS is the main topic today
we are going to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Cornell community, why we care about
the CTIRs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why we care about NARS?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the developing world, this is the
largest public breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, and funded by many funders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so important because since the
Green Revolution in the 1960s,
[SPEAKER_01]: the solving the hunger and even today in
terms of managing the climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only from the innovation
perspective, it's also in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: adoption on the farms field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a great model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has large footprints over hundreds,
hundreds of countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cornell and USDA, we are one of the
3,000 partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the graduate students, you'll hear
your research, your publication,
[SPEAKER_01]: even your future as your different
opportunity to work in industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: or academic, or funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way or the other, because you're in
plant breeding, in plant science,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be in this value chain somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why so many people we know on
campus work with CTIR and NARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here 15 centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are formed over since the Green
Revolution over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes there were 17, 18,
and sometimes 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, active 13 centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lead agriculture innovation
technology transfer to small holders in
[SPEAKER_01]: the developing world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they mainly serve these is not really
for the very profitable, many yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: like large multinationals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge inputs that also cause today the
climate change challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the small stakeholders meeting the
local nutrition, and also diet,
[SPEAKER_01]: and equality, this huge impact as a model
in addition to, well, we learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one recent from the last two to
three years, the genetic innovation from
[SPEAKER_01]: CTIR, the pipeline from the left to the
right, first part is product design to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what farmers, what these
customers, what type of products they
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this involve economists, market
intelligence together looking at from the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, begin with the end for local area
adaptation to help design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going to either the center part as the
gene bank of pre-breeding, and then go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeding networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding networks, they may cause from
original breeding crosses, go with
[SPEAKER_01]: population development, and early testing,
late testing, all the way until on farm
[SPEAKER_01]: trial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this itself can take depends on the
crops, can last somewhere from four to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years before they hand off to the
seed systems in the product delivery,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the variety registration, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little background from the
CTIR perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in the broader network with the
NARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to pass this on to Sage,
and I will come back when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the second part of survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that Sage, please unmute yourself,
thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you, Star.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as mentioned, I'm Sage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a research support specialist at the
Tata Cornell Institute for Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm joined today by my colleague,
Greg Traxler, who is a Tata Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow, also working on the Feed the
Future Innovation Lab for Crop
[SPEAKER_03]: Improvement, or what we call ILSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're both members of the ILSI
Institutional Capacity Research Team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just to know, we're mostly a group
of economists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited to present some of
our preliminary results and ideas with
[SPEAKER_03]: this group of plant breeding researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Greg will be available for questions
when we get to the Q&A session.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start by just giving a
background of ILSI, which is hosted here
[SPEAKER_03]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: ILSI aims to advance crop improvement
programs in developing countries by
[SPEAKER_03]: facilitating global communication through
a network of experts in National
[SPEAKER_03]: Agricultural Research Systems,
or NARS, in US universities, prioritizing
[SPEAKER_03]: gender and youth inclusivity, nutrition,
market relevance, and crop resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: ILSI is designed to support NARS to set
breeding priorities and adopt modern
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies in plant breeding research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regional centers of innovation in East,
West, and South Africa, Latin America,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Caribbean enable the NARS to
collaborate and share resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: The project focuses on orphan crops that
are relevant to local diets and adapted to
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Tata Cornell Institute is tasked
with measuring the change in institutional
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity of partner NARS as a result of
the ILSI project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I'm showing the simple theory of
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: US university scientists comprise the
upstream research areas in genomics,
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomics, breeding informatics,
and priority setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with the objective areas of
research, there are tools, technologies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and methodologies, what we call TTMs,
that are passed on to NARS through various
[SPEAKER_03]: trainings and workshops with the expressed
outcomes of increasing the rate of genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: gain to impact economic growth,
resilience, and nutritional development
[SPEAKER_03]: goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a little bit of a more in-depth
framework for the ILSI project.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ILSI priority setting objective areas
working with NARS to implement various
[SPEAKER_03]: studies to better understand and
incorporate stakeholder input to create
[SPEAKER_03]: product profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trait discovery team is tasked with
translating those product profiles into
[SPEAKER_03]: feasible breeding objectives, employing
hypothesis testing and experimental
[SPEAKER_03]: design.
[SPEAKER_03]: The genomics, phenomics, and breeding
informatics team have a more direct impact
[SPEAKER_03]: on the breeder's equation components,
and labeling breeding programs to employ
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies to reduce cycle time and
streamline the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately leading to genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ILSI's philosophy suggests that if
target population needs are optimally
[SPEAKER_03]: understood through effective priority
setting and integrating gender equality,
[SPEAKER_03]: youth engagement, nutrition, and
resilience, varieties will be adopted
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively, thereby meeting their
intended impact on livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by serving the NARS partners,
we want to better understand the crop
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also wanted to know which modern TTMs
are being used in which breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by identifying capacity gaps,
we could better understand the strengths
[SPEAKER_03]: and needs of institutions and individual
breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, monitoring capacity
changes over time enable the team to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand which ILSI interventions have
an impact on capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to come up with the metrics in a survey
tool to measure institutional capacity,
[SPEAKER_03]: the team first conducted a comprehensive
scoping review of the literature to define
[SPEAKER_03]: institutional capacity in the context of
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We identified 74 papers that assess the
various components that make up
[SPEAKER_03]: institutional capacity, and this helped us
create a list of indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then reviewed existing capacity
assessment tools like the BPAT,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was used in the CGIAR system to
identify and adapt relevant metrics to the
[SPEAKER_03]: ILSI context.
[SPEAKER_03]: This led to various discussions with
experts in the field, including ILSI
[SPEAKER_03]: objective area leaders, enabling the team
to arrive at this initial list of survey
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We conducted a Delphi among experts and
stakeholders to generate a consensus on
[SPEAKER_03]: our list of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then using this list of questions,
separated into indicator areas,
[SPEAKER_03]: the team conducted a pilot survey with 14
acresap breeding programs in Africa and
[SPEAKER_03]: Asia to test the functionality and
technical features of the survey,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also to receive some feedback from the
programs concerning the quality of the
[SPEAKER_03]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then went back with all the feedback
and simplified the tool and reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: questions to eliminate redundancies and
streamline the survey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we conducted the survey to
measure the baseline capacity of 18 NARS
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding programs involved in the ILSI
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left shows the components of
capacity that were identified in our
[SPEAKER_03]: literature review, including the various
resources available to a program,
[SPEAKER_03]: management and planning, collaborative
activities, breeding activities,
[SPEAKER_03]: setting priorities and stakeholder
involvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: These components were translated into our
indicator areas for the survey,
[SPEAKER_03]: as seen on the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each indicator area represents a
module in the survey, each containing
[SPEAKER_03]: about 10 to 15 questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we surveyed the nine ILSI NARS partners
with a total of 18 breeding programs in
[SPEAKER_03]: Africa and Latin America.
[SPEAKER_03]: The program surveyed were working with
crops, including cowpea, sorghum,
[SPEAKER_03]: millet, common bean, and sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the left, you can see that about 30%
of breeding programs surveyed did not make
[SPEAKER_03]: any crosses in 2019, and only 6% made more
than 100 crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most programs made in between one and
100 crosses in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the graph on the right shows
variety release over a three year period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the programs that reported to release
varieties, we can see almost 50% did not
[SPEAKER_03]: release any varieties in 2017 to 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: So only 34% released three or more
varieties over that three year period,
[SPEAKER_03]: corresponding to an average of one variety
per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as for the use of modern technology,
we first looked to the digitization of
[SPEAKER_03]: data, where we found just over half of the
programs surveyed did not collect any
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypic data digitally at the field
level, while 27% of the programs collected
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% to 100% of phenotypic data digitally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The right table shows the percentage of
programs that use breeding management
[SPEAKER_03]: software for various breeding activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using software for trial designs or
trait data were the most common,
[SPEAKER_03]: while very few programs use breeding
management software for genomic data.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the bottom left graph shows some of the
more modern techniques to achieve greater
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic gains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can see that half of the programs
use genomic services, a third use marker
[SPEAKER_03]: assisted selection, and less than a
quarter use genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since achieving genetic gains is the
express goal of the ELSI project,
[SPEAKER_03]: we then asked NARS if they measure genetic
gain and learned that just 11% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: programs that were surveyed do measure
genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I described earlier, resource
availability comprises an important part
[SPEAKER_03]: of institutional capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the availability of scientific staff
and genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we learned about 60% of the NARS
surveyed have less than three full-time
[SPEAKER_03]: equivalent staff available to their
programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the programs have less than
500 accessions available to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: For comparison, I'm displaying the data
from our pilot survey with ICRSAP breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, where most of them reported to
have greater than 1500 accessions
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some things that we learned is that
there is high heterogeneity within the
[SPEAKER_03]: NARS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this should be considered when
targeting TTMs that will be most
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate based on the NARS capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most NARS were making less than 100
crosses, released less than an average of
[SPEAKER_03]: one variety per year, and had a small
number of scientific staff and genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: resources available to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this level of plant breeding research,
there's a smaller probability to enhance
[SPEAKER_03]: rates of genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in contrast, there are a few programs
that were surveyed that are reporting to
[SPEAKER_03]: use modern techniques, conduct many
crosses, and have more available
[SPEAKER_03]: resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: A large component of an institutional
capacity is the policies in place that
[SPEAKER_03]: determine the funding allocated to each
program, which impacts the availability of
[SPEAKER_03]: resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So orphan crops comprise a smaller
proportion of institutions' budgets
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to other crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Given that there's these institutional
constraints in the state of breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, within the state of breeding in
many of these programs that we surveyed
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was describing earlier,
it may be best to adapt capacity-building
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts to ensure that NARS breeding
programs are testing and releasing
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties more effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could mean targeting TTMs,
such as collecting and analyzing
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholder input to generate product
profiles, more accurate phenotyping,
[SPEAKER_03]: data management, and experimental design.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the programs that have a higher level
of capacity will be better candidates for
[SPEAKER_03]: targeted training of these more advanced
genomic-type TTMs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, tools like our survey to
monitor capacity can be helpful in the
[SPEAKER_03]: decision-making process to better
understand each program and adapt TTMs
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little background that we will
actually do the same survey at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the project in this upcoming year to
measure that change in capacity so we can
[SPEAKER_03]: track those changes over time using this
survey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very few NARS are measuring genetic
gain, variety turnover, adoption,
[SPEAKER_03]: or yield gains in farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are really important measures of
progress to track the actual impact on
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a consideration of what we
might want to quantify in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to now hand this over to Star
again to talk about some of the studies
[SPEAKER_03]: that she's been conducting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know she ran through very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you may have questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's just one quick burning
question, we can also save some time at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'm going to switch to the second
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is on the CGAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one's on these two completely
independent survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this survey was conducted in the first
three quarters of 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: The context of this survey is with 1CG
means the 15 centers, there are similar
[SPEAKER_01]: crop breeding programs across different
centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 1CG was for them to work together as
these large companies located in different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this, different centers have very
limited bioinformatics resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the institutional capacity,
servers, data management systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: also there are statisticians, quantitative
geneticists, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this context, the thinking is if all
the bioinformaticians, quantitative
[SPEAKER_01]: geneticists, they work together with the
COVID mode, people can work online and can
[SPEAKER_01]: provide services support to the centers
and the regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not have the resources in the data
analysis, in the decision support,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this survey, with this in the
mind, there was also transitional in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of people from excellence breeding to the
breeding resources and genetic innovation,
[SPEAKER_01]: these new funding as a project,
the new program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yung Wali, she took the position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kylie was before as the module five lead
in excellence breeding, and she led about
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics and informatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with her as the program
manager, managing all the
[SPEAKER_01]: bioinformaticians, quantitative
geneticists across all the centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while there's a funding transition,
the module three lead, the genotyping,
[SPEAKER_01]: the service two manager, Ying Wang,
and also Eduardo, who's the module two
[SPEAKER_01]: lead from excellence breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So together, in one module file,
the four of us in this transitional stage
[SPEAKER_01]: were trying to understand from all the
breeding program perspective, are they
[SPEAKER_01]: ready if we have a centralized service?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, what are the key common demands
if they are ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, there are two
overarching goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one on the left-hand side is are
they ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from technical perspective,
also psychological willingness to how
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is the common demands if
they are ready, what type of capabilities
[SPEAKER_01]: they need for these quantitative
geneticist bioinformaticians to provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the survey had a total eight pieces,
and I'm going to get into more details
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the next several slides,
I'm going to talk about the methodologies
[SPEAKER_01]: we used, also some of the results,
and some discussion about the insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these all together in these two
overarching goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part is for social
scientists, I think many of you already
[SPEAKER_01]: know sample size to collect these type of
priority settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for us, the STEM field,
we were learning who do we send a survey
[SPEAKER_01]: to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the data is going to really indicate
truly the program what they need rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than diluted?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a lot of back and forth,
the four of us thinking, and we agreed
[SPEAKER_01]: with the different CG leads is we only
send it to the head of the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can work themselves and distribute
if needed, and this need to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: representing how the weight from what they
need, is that what we send to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why highly selected, one survey
sent to each person with personal email,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wrote describing the background,
why this is important, and also time to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn around the accessory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individual survey sent to CGR breeding
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out some of them answered
themselves, and they also allocated to
[SPEAKER_01]: their subject matter expert for the parts
of the questions, they are the best expert
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent to the 12 NARS breeding head,
six responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And among total 25 respondents,
they represent 16 different crops and 12
[SPEAKER_01]: centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the overview for all the CGIR
people who answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the center affiliation and
the crops they represent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones highlighted in red,
they come in answering this survey with
[SPEAKER_01]: the manager role, looking at this big
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one un-highlighted,
they are almost like lead breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: representing their entire program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have 89% responses rate and 240
participant rate because some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: centers, they have multiple subject matter
expert answered the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from NARS, interesting, we send it to
12 breeding head, but only six responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can discuss later why we couldn't
accommodate the same participation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a 50% participation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for respect, I'm now listing the
other six we invited, but didn't answer
[SPEAKER_01]: the survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully this also represent the
other 50% of the NARS breeding programs
[SPEAKER_01]: need as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So highlighted this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question, as I mentioned,
overarching goal on the left-hand side,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to know is, are they technically
ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: To measure the institutional capacity,
we want to define what's called an
[SPEAKER_01]: institution capacity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So capacity including technical and human
capital resources, germplasm, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: together collectively, are they able to do
the program quickly and in good quality to
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting the demands and the mandates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how we define as the
institution capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first we want to understand,
are they ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to provide a centralized
services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from here, I don't know, you can see
very well, but overall, we want to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them very similar, these two independent
study as a stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are thinking good heads think about
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked them for phenotypic data or
pedigree data, genotype data, and a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding process, these different type of
data, are they already captured in digital
[SPEAKER_01]: format?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are digital format, they are
shared in centralized services and
[SPEAKER_01]: servers, then these biometricians can sit
somewhere, analyze their data together and
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute the results and that would give
more power, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to ask them, are they
digitalized or they are just doing on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own computer or on piece of paper,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 75% of the breeding head or the
participants they mentioned, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have these in digital
formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the phenotype data mostly digitalized,
followed by genotyping data and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pedigree data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lastly is the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: These means ISO piece, how things make
transition from one person's hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: one stage gated to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's least digitalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I want to point out is waste of
data, how you really get inside is not
[SPEAKER_01]: only you collect the data, because this is
harder to see what does that mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we run that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also develop a method to look
at is called a sum of product as the
[SPEAKER_01]: indicator to look at this, with more
insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the degree of data digitized
measured as a percent of data collected
[SPEAKER_01]: and also stored in the digital formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see the phenotype data
when they run as low, like say zero to
[SPEAKER_01]: 33%, mid, 34 to 66% high, means 67 to 100%
of data already in the digital format.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you multiply the data level for
each one ranked by the counts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you sum that up called a sum of
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is as one indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this, you can more easily,
simply compare them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the breeding process only
46% digitalized with the highest phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that also match with what we see in
stage survey as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we asked them about
infrastructure, do they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure cloud or server,
and are they ready, even they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure to share, they are ready to
use the data analytic services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we asked these questions,
just very simple for them to read as one
[SPEAKER_01]: to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the current state readiness were
qualitatively assessed at a low,
[SPEAKER_01]: medium, high, or as one to three,
or one to five, from one's lowest to five
[SPEAKER_01]: is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is qualitative, it just gives some
indication is not directly quantify their
[SPEAKER_01]: readiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, you can see the ones on the
right side, infrastructure, actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are pretty good for most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the five is highest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interim readiness, actually,
model four and five, they are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to have the centralized analytic
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is the data management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the management practices,
are they willing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked them about currently,
do you have your data just dispersed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means on your local, or they are like
a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some centralized on cloud server,
or purely centralized server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see is in the three,
means the centralized 24%, and the large
[SPEAKER_01]: majority, 64%, still on their local
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are definitely making sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see very diverse differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 24% program, they are technically
more ready to adopt these centralized
[SPEAKER_01]: services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So transition into the next part is in the
goal two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second goal is about if they are ready
for centralized analytic function to
[SPEAKER_01]: support them, what kind of capabilities do
they need from the phenotypic,
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypic, bioinformatics, and data
management, our full functional area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked them the features they want to
have as a must have, or should have,
[SPEAKER_01]: could have, or will now have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the must have means non-negotiable,
and should have is important, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: adding significant value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And could have means natural have,
but if we leave out how small impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will now have means not this time frame is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked them to put these capabilities
in these buckets, and we also assign a
[SPEAKER_01]: numerical value for three to one for each
of the category.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allow us to quantify the final
demand, and also find out priority ranking
[SPEAKER_01]: in the capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see this is just one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: In term of data collection, after
collecting, you do data curation,
[SPEAKER_01]: data analysis, decision support.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these full functional area,
what do they consider as must have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on the counts, the frequency
distribution, you can see this is way for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to quantify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the demand calculated not only with the
must, should, could, and will now have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did a summer product, very
similar, like early on I showed you in the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ratings for each category ranking
multiply by the number of accounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do the sum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This give you a cumulative number,
easy for you to compare them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to simplify it, here you can see
the decision support is the last stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeding analytic to provide for
product advancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider is in the highest demand versus
data analysis, and the lowest,
[SPEAKER_01]: the data collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically they are saying they can take
care of the data collection on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they need a supporter for decision
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also see for the must
have, should have, and will now have,
[SPEAKER_01]: some centers have a little bit diverse
wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, for data collection for one
center, they think that this is very
[SPEAKER_01]: important, et cetera, and data curation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for phenotypic analysis, what kind of
capabilities they need, they agreed on
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the analysis here is optimize the
trials, the design, and also the product
[SPEAKER_01]: advancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically there's not much difference,
you can see the points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And relatively lower at the end is like
for some program, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: they think should have is a side selection
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for some program, they want to
have the variety catalog, germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: catalog, to compare germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for two of them consider very
important about a vote that's vetoed by
[SPEAKER_01]: other people participating in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why at the end, there's a lower
ranking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the phenotypic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how about for marker system selection
using need a low density genotyping based
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see, I think Gary Adler, if he see this
reporting, he will be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always talk about calculate the GRM.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GRM, this rise up showing this the
highest in demand and followed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: critical replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the high density genotyping
here is the genomic selection or GWAS
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see GWAS consider not important for
the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead predicting the breeding process to
go to their crossing block consider the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest importance and followed by
predicting GBVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third is function is the
bioinformatics in terms of capabilities
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure we can see provided
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what very timely they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then followed by merging data from
different sources, including phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: pedigree, genotype, et cetera,
and across the different actors,
[SPEAKER_01]: merging them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what currently repeatedly saying in
the seventh, eighth section of the survey,
[SPEAKER_01]: the eighth part of the section of surveys
about how the data flow integrate together
[SPEAKER_01]: so that allow them working holistically
from the pipeline A to Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here they talk about digitize the
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This come in is very obvious and also
centralized databases so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: share with programs in different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this the main results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here the summary already mentioned
based on their ranking, the common high
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for the second part of the goal we
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these high demands, now we have
to ask about do we have the personnel,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quantitative geneticists or the
bioinformaticians to provide all these
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities in high demands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we able to give them the product or
services?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the story actually continue to
be discussed, but at least not now we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the breeding programs,
what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then key learnings, there are many,
many learnings for myself through doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this with the one CG breeding informatics
team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technical readiness considered a really
important, they have digitized data
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, centralized data story for
sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from here, from surgery part you
can see as well increase the investment
[SPEAKER_01]: this uniformly from both NARS and CG
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this to enable them to do the
centralized data sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the common demands, there are many,
but in order to provide this a minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: viable product how to be focused on as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the phase currently we
originally wanted to build that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that didn't take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of factors we can discuss
offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so many learnings, how to make this
ready for the early adopters.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see some of the program 24%,
they have the data management ready and
[SPEAKER_01]: for them different stages of the tools
they need, for example, making the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding crosses early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very diverse programs, sometimes even
though you have this high demand,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go to talk to these breeding
leads from different centers, they do not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give away their own
bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all work together to support the
centralized because different time of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year, different capabilities needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the resources and how to tailor the
support and solving this bottleneck one at
[SPEAKER_01]: a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I think Sage and also Greg,
we can just open up for the questions and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the context of planning the
next steps with LC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's some good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: One CG NARS just got the new commitment
for the next two to three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like 900 millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I heard just two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the second part of survey we
have to pause and also from the people
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the line and also here to see how
we can be part of this value chain as a
[SPEAKER_01]: service provider or as the stakeholder you
see you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to open up for the questions
because we have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just want to give big shout out
to the LC, the area objective area lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did focus the group interviews recently,
not enough time to cover today and
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow in the live meeting I'm going to
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also thank you so much Sage, Greg and also
Matthew for collaborating recently we are
[SPEAKER_01]: planning the ongoing survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see people on the line.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Marjorie, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any ideas of how to increase
the engagement from the NARS and their
[SPEAKER_05]: participation in the surveys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is there, have you noticed any specific
reason why the CGs are more responsive
[SPEAKER_05]: than the NARS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Sage and Greg also had a
comment as well from my part I knew we
[SPEAKER_01]: sent exactly the same personalized email
from our side lead one to one to the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding lead from NARS as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just nice direct working
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe went to their spam folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they didn't see the importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very selective and also have the
personal connection to raise the
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sage, Greg from your surveys, you may also
have the struggle about getting people's
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement participating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that could be a bit of a struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our advantage is that we're all working on
a project together that are receiving
[SPEAKER_03]: funding from the same source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a little bit more of a buy-in
from the NARS we were surveying because
[SPEAKER_03]: they were part of this project already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all represent different teams,
but we have tried to survey other
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, both in the CG and the NARS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had difficulty getting people to
respond at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, these are things we're constantly
thinking about how to get people to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: into this idea that institutional capacity
is a valuable thing to measure and track.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's doing presentations and
trying to talk to more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think these personal connections
make the big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had some responses based on,
you know, knowing some of the NARS from
[SPEAKER_03]: this program and then asking them to ask
some of the breeding programs within their
[SPEAKER_03]: institution themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, this kind of collaborative
network is really useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one question from Kelly on the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly is asking the surveys are
self-assessment versus these external
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation, like a BPAT, any sense of how
well these self-assessment, external
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment align?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be some part aligned and
some part may not so aligned because...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead, Greg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did include in our survey subjective
questions of the scientists.
[SPEAKER_07]: How well do you think you're doing in
particular areas?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your subjective opinion on your
capacity in data management or given
[SPEAKER_07]: areas?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also collect objective data.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have both kind of the,
you know, the counts of number of crosses
[SPEAKER_07]: and access to materials, et cetera,
and then can compare those to the
[SPEAKER_07]: scientists' expressed opinions about their
capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that we hold those out to
compare them, but we could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to add on a little bit,
something that we had done in our research
[SPEAKER_03]: effort is we visited some of the breeding
programs and did some field work there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with those programs, we conducted a
midline assessment and that was the major
[SPEAKER_03]: goal there is to validate some of our
findings, which had changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some, we found that,
you know, one program that had claimed to
[SPEAKER_03]: be doing marker assisted selection when we
asked them in person, they didn't,
[SPEAKER_03]: they weren't actually implementing that
or, you know, maybe they had markers
[SPEAKER_03]: available, but they weren't using them for
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there can be, you know, some
inaccuracies with this, but continuously
[SPEAKER_03]: monitoring over time and going in person
has helped clarify some of those and help
[SPEAKER_03]: us to explain the questions and ensure
we're getting more reliable data based on
[SPEAKER_03]: how we pose the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just want to add that actually the
right questions to ask and also really
[SPEAKER_01]: design a question is more than half of the
survey research itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you get from the answers
largely depend on how you ask this
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely is a really good
complementation for onsite visit to the
[SPEAKER_01]: external evaluation because even,
for example, the answer they answered,
[SPEAKER_01]: like read from one to five level,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the breeding programs located in so
many places, there is a huge heterogeneity
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's difficult to have just one number
to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the breeding lead think they are
ready or they are already at a highest
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we cannot really overlook the
diversity, the whole heterogeneous of
[SPEAKER_01]: these programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a quantitative, simple way to
kind of quick look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering how centralization of
breeding analytics tools might affect the
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity building of young scientists at
NARS or the other breeding specialists
[SPEAKER_04]: working at the NARS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if that came up in the
survey at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think that would affect
willingness to move to this model of
[SPEAKER_04]: centralized services?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if there's young scientists
or students working with these NARS
[SPEAKER_04]: partners who are wanting to learn genomic
prediction or wanting to learn a database.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this definitely is going to be more
difficult for the NARS than for the CGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the young scientists, I think the
model is these onsite visit, a hackathon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even during COVID, these teams work
online together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community building, we had one
platform called a breeding informatics
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people online are joining in different
functional areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have different levels,
some very advanced and some just
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also they complement each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some knows Python, some knows R very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually I see even for Cornell
University and for other LC partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: we provide a huge value in this system as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we have the NARS partners
recently visiting from Costa Rica in ice
[SPEAKER_01]: group for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the one from Senegal as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are learning and then the
university like us provide a huge value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the graduate students,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the publications are from the
faculty here and you guys are at the front
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the learning here for you to
dive into some of the case studies working
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be a one model because these
young junior informaticians, some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: finished a master degree and some of them
actually pursuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after they find the opportunity,
they leave from where they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come to US to do PhD study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lose people over and over by working
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult for the team there
to hire because where they are located
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes no electricity, no internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they are asked to do this,
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most centralized resources for them to
continue even like seminar like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: allow them to continue learning when they
get stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this platform is huge to how this is
not only social capital to boost the
[SPEAKER_01]: morale for them to work, learning
informally.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this platform is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So may not be easy for the supervisor to
say centralized because they have a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, but in the effectiveness, the
collaboration partnership offer great
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry, I don't know this long
answer.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just jump in there for a minute?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, because I think that's a key
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if you were to kind of
separate the individual human capital,
[SPEAKER_07]: the kind of quality of scientists in the
national programs and compare it to 20
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago, it's pretty clear that the
individual scientists are better trained.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you would compare the institutional
capacity to deliver genetic gain within
[SPEAKER_07]: NARS compared to 20 years ago,
I think you would have a much more mixed
[SPEAKER_07]: picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not at all clear that the NARS today
are stronger in their capacity to deliver
[SPEAKER_07]: than they were 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: The picture that emerges is they're not
releasing more varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not doing more crosses than they
were in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you, again, separate out the quality of
the scientists that are in staff in the CG
[SPEAKER_07]: and in the NARS that are trained,
the individual scientists within the NARS
[SPEAKER_07]: have great incentives to build their human
capital and then move on, move on to
[SPEAKER_07]: another, build their career, not
necessarily within the NARS, move to the
[SPEAKER_07]: CG or some other institution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so as institutions, the national
programs are very unstable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Funding is not secure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Resources are not necessarily growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have very poor measures of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the CG has been incredibly unstable
over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's very important to look at
developing some measures of institutional
[SPEAKER_07]: capacity and stability, keeping in mind
that capacity of individuals is an
important factor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an important component, but it is not
always gonna solve the institutional
[SPEAKER_07]: stability problem and lead to more
effective delivery of genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Greg, for that addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The huge challenge is how do they really,
the problem is so much greater than the
[SPEAKER_01]: resources they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to do what they are
asked to do with three full-time people
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe they do not have the expertise
and they need to have the resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people work in NARS, at least
national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are only maybe one third or
one quarter of the salary as the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: like say, classmate who went to work at
the CGIR scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ji Ping, maybe the last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can stay for other people's
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Sage and Greg can stay as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've done the survey.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your best plan?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give the feedback to different
institutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's their planning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the survey, you have the data.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess your goal is of the surveys are to
give some feedback to the different
[SPEAKER_06]: institutes or leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my part of survey, I can speak to the
Sage and Greg can answer to that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my part of survey, after we finished,
we share the results with the key
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the justification.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the functionalities we need to
put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to build this one centralized
analytic services, prioritize which one to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we left away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this May, we even brought all the
analytic team together in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we did at the planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Face by face, what functionality we focus
on, the components in the matrices serving
[SPEAKER_01]: this entire pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one thing internally deliver
these minimum viable implementation
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with databases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the, like say, Braby or data lake
connecting between the different databases
[SPEAKER_01]: with the functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are asking, this is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing is the first part of the
goal one part of the survey I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: present, but this is also asking the
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you willing to contribute and what
percentage of the budget to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: centralized analytic services and support?
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of the service support,
we have them as a service have other
[SPEAKER_01]: number, just like your other genotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a price.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may have price on this, maybe just as
a service, as a support.
[SPEAKER_01]: This come from the breeding budget,
but they don't have to pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this where we were trying to move on to
the new operational model that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't gather because the funding
as some of you already aware and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: new faces in 24 different story,
this can continue building this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about for Sage, Greg, would you
like to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear Jiping's question after the
survey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you take to the next stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you give back to the participants of
the survey?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you go ahead Sage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our plan at the moment, again,
we're conducting the kind of same
[SPEAKER_03]: measurements at the end of this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took this, the initial baseline
survey in 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that we did is we shared a
lot of these results with the ILC
[SPEAKER_03]: objective areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that we could provide kind of this
baseline information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they knew within their kind of relevant
metrics where the breeding program were at
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this upcoming year when we take
these measurements, again, the plan is to
[SPEAKER_03]: have different kind of reports available
and we'll meet individually with the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding program leads and whoever can
join the call and give some survey
[SPEAKER_03]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, like I mentioned,
we've been visiting a lot of the breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far we visited four of them with a plan
to visit in this next year, three more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an opportunity for us to give
some feedback and talk about these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hopefully this is still up in the
air, but if there's another cycle of this
[SPEAKER_03]: project, this could be involved in the
planning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward, how to take these kind of
gaps in institutional capacity and really
[SPEAKER_03]: plan for the next five years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've also shared our results with the
national programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: To allow them to place their own program
in context of peer programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can kind of see who's doing what,
who's using what, what capacities exist
[SPEAKER_07]: within other NARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just by working with Sage and
Greg and Matthew the last several months,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are still collecting, basically we have
ongoing survey and in January when I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: PEG, we'll continue to collect data from
the participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these insights is going to help us to
plan the next phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about matching the demand with the
supply and identified opportunities and
[SPEAKER_01]: the challenges where, and also if you do
customize the support at individual center
[SPEAKER_01]: or the stages level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these give us this as a foundation to
be more tailored for next phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it by working this
semester and answer the survey from the
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate school or from the course for
evaluation and how great a final.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much Sage and Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
