[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, Dan, for that
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, everyone, for coming out to
the seminar today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to talk with you about
my work, looking at the influence of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial community dynamics on the
cycling and stabilization of soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first piece of this story kind of
comes into why are we interested in soil
carbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: So where that comes in, is looking at how
soil carbon or soil organic matter relates
[SPEAKER_01]: to this concept of soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil health is this idea that we have
our soils maintaining this continued
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to be a living ecosystem that can
sustain our plants, animals, and humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in agriculture, looking at maintaining
a sustainable and productive soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where soil organic matter comes into
this, is that we see that it contributes
[SPEAKER_01]: to better soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can modulate soil water availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important store of soil nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also looking at the global scale,
it's a globally important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially understanding climate
change, soil organic matter is important
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have this goal of increasing soil
health, we also see that increasing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter can help us achieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly in our agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we want to have this and achieve
this goal, we need to understand how soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter is accumulating,
and also how it's retained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of the questions we're asking
ourselves when trying to approach this,
[SPEAKER_01]: are what compounds make up soil organic
matter, and where are those compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: So last week we actually heard a talk from
the Lehman Lab, which was looking at this
[SPEAKER_01]: first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what compounds are making up the soil
organic matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my work is to learn and getting into
the second question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where are these compounds coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is making these compounds that make up
the soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So recent research into this has looked at
how microbial nephromas can be
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to soil organic matter,
also called soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this study did, is they got
metadata from a bunch of different studies
[SPEAKER_01]: that measured microbial nephromas markers,
the extract and the state of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've estimated how much they
believe, how much of a contribution the
[SPEAKER_01]: nephromas was making to the overall soil
organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they looked at this across the
range of soil depths, and then actually up
[SPEAKER_01]: top you'll see all of the soil depths kind
of coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at different types of
soils, so carbonate soil, grassland soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also forest soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across all these systems, microbial
nephromas was measured and estimated to
[SPEAKER_01]: make up around 50% of the soil organic
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so particularly focusing on this term
of nephromas, it's showing the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of understanding the microbial
contributions to this, the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial growth depth cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding how they're making their
nephromas and how much they're making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the question becomes, if this is
the piece that we need to understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: how are we going to measure growth depth?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a trivial thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically if you think about a microbe
and you think about your typical
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiological methods, in order to
measure growth, you probably need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would get an isolate of the
microbe, and grow it under the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, and use that to measure the
growth depth cycles of the microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem comes in the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are notoriously bad at cultivating soil
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, there was a recent study
where they took a soil sample and made the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing to see how many different types
of microbes were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they did that, they found 31 phyla
were present in this soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and this is from the point of
view, they had this new cultivation method
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to use for soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cultivated the microbes and
sequence the ones they were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they did that, they found they
cultivated representatives for the phyla.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cultivation is not a method that we're
able to use to accurately represent the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity that could be happening on the
soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of this problem of
cultivation, we don't need to largely move
[SPEAKER_01]: towards sequencing and sequencing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, instead of relying on cultivating
these microbes, we can extract their DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: and sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, we recently did metagenome
sequencing to the individual type of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coming back to this idea of wanting to
understand growth and death, the genome
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't enough for us to be able to tell
growth and death are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine, perhaps, didn't know
what a dandelion growth and death cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted to understand how it might be
different than its growth and death from
[SPEAKER_01]: an oak tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all you have is the genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not able to measure its growth and
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no particular gene in the genome
that controls the growth and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, what the readers have found is
there's a variety of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth and death is something that arises
from the entire genome working together to
[SPEAKER_01]: create what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the microbes in the soil that
we're able to measure, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's differences in growth and death
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is showing the abundance of
microbes over time, a growth curve for
[SPEAKER_01]: soil microorganism.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, the blue and yellow one is
really rapid growth and rapid growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: death, whereas the red one is very slow
growth and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar to a dandelion, an oak tree,
there are big differences in how these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes are growing in the soil and
appear to have different patterns of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if all we have from them is their
metagenome sequence or genome sequence,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't tell from that what growth and
death the microbes have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't really understand the
necromancy they might be making and
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to the carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, we just run into these
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't cultivate microbes, so we can't
measure growth and death that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we have the genome sequence or we
understand the pylogeny of the microbe,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't really use that to tell us how
the microbe is growing and dying,
[SPEAKER_01]: what its growth and death cycles are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we come back to this issue of how
do we make sense and measure the phobia
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that the field recently has
been trying to get around this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's using something known as life history
strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a term that is largely
borrowed from planet ecology, which at one
[SPEAKER_01]: point ran into a similar problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's based on this idea that an
organism can't be the best at everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make trade-offs in your
general approach to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then specifically trade-offs in things
such as your growth, your resource
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisition, and your survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different specialties that you
can feed into, or you can be a generalist
[SPEAKER_01]: in some of these specialties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you function and survive in
your ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a classic example of this is Brian's
competitor, stress tolerator, and urology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a way that he used to
categorize the life history strategies of
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, a competitor, you can
think of an organism like an oak tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an organism that grows slower,
has more investment into the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good at competing resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you can think of a little or a
meaty species, something like a dandelion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows quickly and dies quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its goal is to produce a lot of offspring,
and it's not invested in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, you have a sub-human,
or something that's stressed or scarcely
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of these organisms is not to
die.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can live in stressful environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other organisms may not be able to
live long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not trying to grow really
quickly or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying not to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we look and come back and
think about applying this to microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, we have this observation that
growth and death cycles are different in
[SPEAKER_01]: different microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this kind of sense that there
might be a difference in life history
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy between different microbes that
could help us understand what function
[SPEAKER_01]: they're having in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question becomes, is there a
way, similar to what's been done with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, that we're able to find trade-off
traits in microorganisms that we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: to define what specialty they might be
having in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their investment into things such as
growing resource acquisition and survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really where the first
question and the first part of the project
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in, is can we build a life history
framework that explains microbial growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and death behaviors, that explains the
different specialties in life strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbes might be having in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so previous work in this area has
largely started trying to apply life
[SPEAKER_01]: history frameworks to microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first questions that you
have to ask yourself as well, what traits
[SPEAKER_01]: are we trying to look at in microbes to be
able to question this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in plants, the way, again, this concept
is far from plants ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have found things such as leaf
area, leaf dry matter content,
[SPEAKER_01]: and specific leaf area related to life
history strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so measuring these traits tells you
something about how plants are testing its
[SPEAKER_01]: energy to be a specialist in surviving in
its environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from this, you are able to understand
the life history strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as to microbes, though, there's no
leaves that we can measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, going through and looking at
microbes, even through a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really an impossible task when you're
looking at a soil that can have billions
[SPEAKER_01]: and billions of microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned before, our way of kind
of peening out and looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial capability is through these
genome imaging sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, with growth and death,
you can't look at just single gene or a
[SPEAKER_01]: single set of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, what we're interested in
looking at is what I'm calling general
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, kind of explaining what I
mean by general genomic features,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at zooming out a bit on your
genome and understanding what general
[SPEAKER_01]: tools do you have to accomplish different
tasks in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example could be a membrane
transporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of your genome is made up of
membrane transporters?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much are you able to pull stuff in
across your cell wall or push stuff out
[SPEAKER_01]: across your cell wall?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how might that be related,
then, to what you're doing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem or overall approach to life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another example could be transcription
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genome transcription factors help
you turn off and turn on genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help you control your gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could imagine an environment
that perhaps is not good for microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, it's nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have two microbes, one that has
many transcription factors and one that
[SPEAKER_01]: only has a few transcription factors
living in this environment, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly there's a washing nutrient,
so the environment that we have is very
[SPEAKER_01]: good for the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine that, perhaps,
the microbe with many transcription
[SPEAKER_01]: factors, that they will respond more
quickly to this change in the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and change its gene expression to turn on
its growth and reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quickly able to respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: They begin replicating in this
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or perhaps a microbe with a few
transcription factors can't change as
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, so it's not able to start
replicating as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, perhaps, general features such
as transcription factors have an influence
[SPEAKER_01]: on the growth and development and the
response of a microorganism in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a history switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So current work in this field has really
looked at making an overall life history,
[SPEAKER_01]: first going in and defining what they
think the different life history do and
[SPEAKER_01]: how those could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using their understanding of the
biology and trying to come up with,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the first hand, what they think the
groups could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go and look for genomic
features that are interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially related to this categorized
life history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm proposing is to do the
opposite of that and start by looking into
[SPEAKER_01]: the genomic features, in particular the
ones that seem interesting and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: would be trading off to define your
general approach to biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of applying the framework to
the genomic data, I'm using the genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: data to inform that green issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I am finding and analyzing
the genomic features, using those to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me what specialties do I think microbes in
the soil environment might be trading off
[SPEAKER_01]: against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using that to define my life history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, so we have evidence,
I've shown this figure quite a few times,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes are growing differently in the
soil, they have different growth and death
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have evidence that general genomic
features, like I mentioned, so the space
[SPEAKER_01]: of membrane transpose for the prescription
factors are associated with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, then we have an organ and
these two factors are positively
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have high membrane transpose who also
appear to have high transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can imagine an organism that
occupies this side of the graph might be
[SPEAKER_01]: having a very different life history
strategy than organisms that occupies a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where they have low transcription
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really defines what the first
part of my work aims to build on is
[SPEAKER_01]: examining genomes and metagenomes from the
soil and looking for these general genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: features that appear to be showing a
trade-off indicative of specializing into
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain life history strategy or have
interesting relationships to the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and death or life history of
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, I use those features
I've identified to understand what those
[SPEAKER_01]: different specialties could be and how
those could be related again to how the
[SPEAKER_01]: organism overall is approaching its life
history and what it's doing in a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the conclusion of this,
my hope would be that we could take the
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes of organisms and the metagenomes
of organisms and use that along a plot
[SPEAKER_01]: like this to understand what sort of niche
and what sort of ecological shortness is
[SPEAKER_01]: identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that, get a sense of this growth and
death as well as other factors related to
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're thinking back to this
growth and death, we want to also
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why would this be important for
soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have some initial hypotheses
about how some of these potential
[SPEAKER_01]: groupings could relate to soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had a growth adapted organism,
we think about a utero or a dandelion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps that's an organism that's
producing large amounts of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps it's growing and dying rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's producing a lot of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we go to a competition adapted
organism, we think about like an oak tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps it's producing an intermediate
amount of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not growing as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not dying as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to understand how that
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you think about a scarcity
adapted organism, that's goal is just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not producing a lot of micro mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can imagine how being occupying
these different spectrums of specialty
[SPEAKER_01]: could then go on and influence how the
microbial community is contributing to
[SPEAKER_01]: soil carbon and the accumulation of soil
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the first part of my work is
kind of nailing down and defining what
[SPEAKER_01]: these different life history strategies
could be and how we can achieve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the subsequent questions I would have
is maybe going back into the field and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting closer and closer back to that
question of the influence on soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the questions would be,
do our management practices influence what
[SPEAKER_01]: life history groups are present in soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what the relative composition of those
different life history groups are?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I would look at tillage
because we know tillage alters the
[SPEAKER_01]: composition of the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know how it might impact what
ecological niche these different soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms are occupying or what their
specific specialties might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be what's important for
understanding microbes and soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final question, which is
really related to my head like I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, do these different life history
groupings actually matter for soil carbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some hypotheses, again,
about how they could be related to micro
[SPEAKER_01]: mass production, but actually going out
and using soils to study if these life
[SPEAKER_01]: history strategies differences in
composition have consequences for the
[SPEAKER_01]: eventual carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really is some of what I'm going
to be doing focused heavily on the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning work and leading to the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all so much for listening and
I'll be happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, well that's honestly is a big
problem for our understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that using the life history
strategy that also actually allows me a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more breadth to take into account
these facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're swapping genes, that would be
important to change in your life history
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be setting up a framework that would
take that into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the swapping of genes really
becomes an issue if you're trying to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically on phylogeny and
understanding how phylogeny, if you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak to your closely related weakness
one takes up a bunch of genes that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: in this, they didn't get from the physics
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: But history framework would be taking a
step away from phylogeny and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the set of genes that you
currently have, whether they got from your
[SPEAKER_01]: ancestors or got from something else,
and what does that mean for how you
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially approach your life,
or whatever your strategy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be more particular complex
narrative changes versus your attention to
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on right now, I guess you
weren't speaking about, the cloud comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through, it changed, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very naive question, how do you measure
necromancy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see a dead animal or a dead plant,
how do I know that being in the soil is a
[SPEAKER_01]: dead microbe, you still see the
necromancy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they use is a marker of microbial
cell wall composition, so in that study
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, they broke it up into
bacterial and fungal, so they extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil again and part of it,
and measured the amount of kundorandic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, which is a bacterial cell wall
component, and then mucosalibid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a fungal cell wall component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had an equation for
converting that into an estimate of
[SPEAKER_01]: necromancy based on how much of a cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cell wall showing the pink microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are unique signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just before that, a question about,
I think the matter that you kind of talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about more in terms of, you know,
sugar, that is kind of a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: necromancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for the conversion factor,
you mentioned that it's effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: converted to, I think there's a lot of
debate on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah, so it is a nest, but as you may
have learned from the presentation last
[SPEAKER_01]: time, as many people in this field,
it's really hard to tell what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are signatures that we're trying
to ask for their contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another question about,
I'm kind of very curious about your second
[SPEAKER_01]: study about, you mentioned about how the
management affects the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: necromancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give me an example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any hypothesis about how the
management affects the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: necromancy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also, again, this is coming largely
from concepts of plant ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with plant ecology, we think about life
history strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just something that encourages
plants that are able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like you come through and
you pass the soil up, and you kill all the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one that are able to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our initial hypothesis for instance,
is that a similar thing is occurring in
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbial necromancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can think, especially if you have
fungi that rely a lot on sealant that
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go through until that,
those fungi are going to get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps in the wake of that,
or like those that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferate are the ones that are not in
competition with that, but instead are
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote the doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to grow quickly in people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the wonderful introduction
and good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: As he said, my name is Alex Yor,
and today I'll be giving my M exam seminar
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation entitled dynamic crop growth
data for picking nitrogen status maids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as most, or probably all of you know,
nitrogen is very critical fertilizer for
[SPEAKER_02]: any agronomic system, very particularly
maids.
So what happens is it's often over
applied.
And this is, the simple reason is this is
sort of a cheap insurance policy to
protect against uncertainties in the
season.
A lot of things can happen from the time
you plant, the time you fertilize to the
time you actually harvest.
So applying a little extra nitrogen is
typically thought of as a reasonable
practice.
But there's a fine line between sort of
managing yield loss and then offloading
nitrogen in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, as most of you probably
know, nitrogen is very reactive in the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can move around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this can cause a lot of ecological harm
when it's over applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a big rain after you apply,
and now you're washing the waterways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing a lot of harm to the
ecosystem.
There's potential human health effects.
And then we also have nitrous oxide
emissions.
This is a major greenhouse gas.
So this can be very problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, what's very common is uniform
application nitrogen field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you pick a rate, maybe you add 20% or
something like that, but you apply that
same amount across the field irrespective
of where it's needed or where it's not
needed as much.
Even in precision systems where they have
a little more control over rates and have
a little more spatial control.
Typically, this is done with like a static
piece of information like last year's
yield map.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll use some algorithm to derive
a rate for particular areas of your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you're using this sort of
single point data where there's an NDVI
[SPEAKER_02]: map or a field map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this sort of led me to this question
of, can we use some kind of dynamic model
[SPEAKER_02]: to inform our nitrogen application rates
at a spatial scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I mean by dynamic model is
instead of taking a single point,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a single NDVI image, take more of a
time series.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get some additional information
from this time series leading up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: time we would fertilize to give us a
better sense of what the nitrogen status
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to do this, we measured crop height
about two to three times a week in our
fields.
We performed spectral measurements about
once or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did nitrogen status
measurement of the actual plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we fit a model to the whole thing and
kind of try to tie it all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I really want to point out
is we cannot use yield data in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I imagine somebody would ask
because any agronomic pursuit,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the paramount becomes yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know, how is this going to
affect my yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to hurt my yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to help my yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to maximize it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to point out now that
we didn't look at yield in this part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually part of a broader
body of work that we actually do have the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire growth rate through the entire
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have field data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the purposes of this project,
we're not looking at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this took place over a few different
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here in Ithaca, we had three different
sites across three years, 2021 and 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is we had two separate
planting dates per field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling those the different site
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you essentially have created a
different environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you plant two weeks later, you're sort
of changing the environment a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least in terms of weather pattern,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three sites, three years here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Ithaca, we also partnered with our
colleagues at Agriculture Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, if you're not aware, is essentially
the Canadian version of the USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They provided us with one year of data
this past year, 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same protocol, where they did two
different planting dates.
And they had three different fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were probably in blocks, but there
were three separate fields within this
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a map of theirs at Lakhani,
which is just south of Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's their three different fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, two planting dates, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little squares we'll talk about in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our three sites.
So 2021, we were at McGowan Woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2022, we were at Caldwell Field,
which you probably know as over by the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 2023, we're a couple of miles
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the rest of the talk will focus
primarily on 2023 data, with a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: So primarily on our last year's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we mapped out the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, Professor Longchamp here
is backpacked with this funny little
[SPEAKER_02]: antenna on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what this is, it's an RTK GPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this does is it allows us to have
sort of centimeter level resolution within
[SPEAKER_02]: the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can walk around the field and know
where we are within a couple centimeters
[SPEAKER_02]: accuracy, or within about a centimeter
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is, so as promised,
the little squares the way these little
[SPEAKER_02]: squares are, they're three meter pixels
within the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we flagged out the corners of the,
and again, that's why we needed this high
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution GPS so that we could map this
out precisely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we chose the size and the
orientation is because this is based on
[SPEAKER_02]: planet satellites, which if you're not
aware, it's sort of a daily pass high
resolution satellite product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically they've sent an entire swarm of
little satellites up into the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it allows them to give us daily
inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we matched that to their grid so that
we can use this for further work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: satellite data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I mentioned, we have two different
planting dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the southern half of the field is
planted around date May, second half of
[SPEAKER_02]: the field is about two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the height measurement, pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see up there, there's sort of a
zip tie circling the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this with all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually went back and measured the
same plants every time we measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are 10 of them within each field
with a specific colored zip tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can actually track the growth of the
individual plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't play as much into this
particular project, but we did want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that granularity for later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, what we did is we average the
heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have sort of an average height for
the individual three by three meter pixel.
[SPEAKER_02]: This corresponded well with what they did
in Canada, which is where they just
[SPEAKER_02]: average the average value, didn't have
that sort of granularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured from the soil surface to the
highest leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to point out that we did
unmanipulate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is we didn't move the leaf in any
way, or we didn't stretch it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a pretty standard protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you will, you know,
hold the leaf up to its highest point and
[SPEAKER_02]: measure that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we chose not to do that and to
do it this way is we wanted to correspond
[SPEAKER_02]: this more closely to what you would see
would say a LIDAR where you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: actually touching the plant.
You can't affect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how the plant sits, where it is,
what is the height that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to measure that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, there were 10 plants per
pixel that we're measuring the ultimate
[SPEAKER_02]: average height over that nine square meter
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the spectral measurement,
we used the ASD field spec handheld.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we didn't use it handheld,
we used it on this boom and on a ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this to get about four meters
above the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we did this is because the
spots size of the actual device comes out
[SPEAKER_02]: to about three and a half meters at that
height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it worked out perfectly, nearly
perfectly with our pixel size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would stand up on a ladder and
measure straight down if that was how we
[SPEAKER_02]: got our spectral data.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges with this is it
requires a lot of calibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see on the right, a colleague
here holding up this device called
[SPEAKER_02]: Spectralon, essentially just like a pure
white reflective surface that we were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get sort of a white balance for our
device.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had to do this every 10 to 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're going along, we're constantly
recalibrating to make sure we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: most accurate data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now our wise Canadian friends use the
drone to get their spectral data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having walked through the field with a
ladder or a box, I'm a little jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, because we were trying to tie
this to this sort of planet satellite
[SPEAKER_02]: data, what we did is we took this,
so this figure on the right is sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: typical day's measurement from the ASP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a hyperspectral instrument,
so we're actually getting single nanometer
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution from 375 to 1025.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is we broke this down into
individual bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these bands correspond to the planet
Superdub, which is the current instruments
[SPEAKER_02]: that are up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to match up that band
structure so that we could ultimately use
[SPEAKER_02]: this data and use this protocol with the
satellite data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for nitrogen status measurement,
we did, in 2021 and two, we did a nitrate
stat test.
So this is taking fresh plants and
actually measure the amount of nitrate
within that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, since we're not focusing as much on
the 2021 and two data, don't worry too
much about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for 2023, what we did is nitrogen
nutrition index.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this is is essentially a measure of
the nitrogen in the field or the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: in your plants relative to a sort of
critical nitrogen concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This critical nitrogen concentration is a
sufficient level for growth, at least
theoretically.
And it tends to be a pretty good standard,
pretty good hallmark for this,
for this kind of work.
So for this, we actually took dry plants.
So we did destructive sampling in and
around the pixels in question,
and then derived our NNI values from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This protocol was also followed in Canada,
so we have consistent measurements for
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a typical plot of our height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the individual points are the actual
measurements where we measured the height.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is we fit this exponential
curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you know a little bit about sort
of corn growth or even plant growth in
general, if you look throughout though,
if you sort of project this out through
the whole season, you're going to see sort
of a logistic curve and fit really well.
Because we're not looking at the entire
season, we're just looking at this early
stage growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The exponential model actually fits really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've seen a logistic model,
essentially the first half of it is an
[SPEAKER_02]: exponential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this actually fit really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: From this curve, we generated a growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, how fast is it growing at
that last centimeter per day?
So our exponential fits were really good.
Our mean R-squared was 0.997.
It's exponential fits.
I mean, you can see that there's pretty
strong relationship there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fit really well.
So we went with this, calculated the
growth rate from that.
This is for 113 pixels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is including the Canadian as well
as the Ithaca locations for all three
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a similar process for NDVI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the points are the actual measured
NDVI, or it's calculated NDVI in this
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We calculated sort of an NDVI growth rate
or the NDVI increase rate.
So how fast is the NDVI increasing at that
last measurement day right before side
dress?
The fit was not quite as strong for
exponential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just see that this is just a
typical plot and the points were a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our mean R-squared is about 0.86.
[SPEAKER_02]: The N is a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had only 95 points here because the
2021 data would not have spectral data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not included in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now looking at our static model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, by static model, I'm saying a
single data point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're just looking at this one
point, just the height, you measure one
[SPEAKER_02]: time right before side dress, you measure
the height.
[SPEAKER_02]: How good of an indicator is that of the
nitrogen status?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're looking at about a 0.68
R-squared for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is NNI versus height.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we wanted to see is, okay,
we're looking specifically at this one day
right before side dress.
What about all the other days before that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other days that might be a
better predictor?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we sort of move down along this
curve, looking towards planting date,
we see the R-squared drop off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real improvement here with the
static model for looking backwards in
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to predict it a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we look at our dynamic model,
again, this is height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at NNI, but now we're
looking at growth rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the slope of that curve
essentially at that last point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our growth rate, the dynamic
model, which we've derived from the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: exponential curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this, our R-squared is about 0.64.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not bad for predicting nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we wanted to look and see,
okay, what if we moved back through time
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of move our way through here?
[SPEAKER_02]: How good of a bit do we get?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see there's a little bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red line indicates the R-squared of
our left-hand plot, which is measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: just at the last date.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now if you measure about a week
earlier, you get a pretty significant bump
[SPEAKER_02]: in accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually just a little bit higher
than the static model in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually good news because
typically you want a little bit of lead
time to be able to plan this thing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're gonna use this sort of tool to
indicate how much to fertilize,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd be nice to know that a few days
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, sort of projecting forward into
using satellite data, this would be really
[SPEAKER_02]: important because as we all know here,
bios can be a big issue with satellite
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that window of time where you
actually have still a decent accuracy is
[SPEAKER_02]: really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now again, looking at the static model,
this is for NDVI now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing, if we just take the NDVI value
at that last point, what do we get?
[SPEAKER_02]: The R-squared is not great, about .3,
.33.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if we look and project this out and
look back in time, how early can we get a
[SPEAKER_02]: better measurement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we really can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you go back through, it's gonna
just drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I do wanna point out though is
for our height model, the actual measured
[SPEAKER_02]: height and the projected height for our
last day were spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the same, the model and the
measure were almost identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that from .99 R-squared.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, there was a little bit of a
discrepancy between the model values.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red line here is the actual
measurement R-squared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So corresponding to the figure on the
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now this is looking at the point,
the actual measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take the point on the curve as
opposed to the measured point,
we actually get a little bit better
accuracy that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, moving down, going back in
time, our accuracy just drops if you go
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier and earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with our dynamic model for NDVI,
and again, this is looking at that
[SPEAKER_02]: increased rate of NDVI.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fast is the NDVI increasing at that
last day?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we got an R-squared about
.49.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a pretty significant
improvement over the static model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this sort of underlies this sense
of using a single point NDVI to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: predict nitrogen status is maybe not the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a dynamic model may actually have some
improvement over this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, as we go back in time about
five days, we get a little bit of a bump
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little bit of an increase in the
overall accuracy of the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now comparing the static and dynamic
models, as we just mentioned, the overall
[SPEAKER_02]: R-squared was actually just a little bit
higher for the static model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is only for the date right before
side dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we actually look across all days,
again, we have this little bit of room for
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement, which takes the dynamic model
just kind of ekes out the static model in
this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, because now we're a week
earlier that we can make this prediction,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really important one for planning
purposes, also giving us a window as we
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of this process into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly for the NDVI, except in this
case, we did see a pretty big increase
[SPEAKER_02]: between the static and dynamic model
directly at the last day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we also have this little bump of
improvement on five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is really helpful for planning
and also sort of mitigating issues with
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get satellite data right on the
day that we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to sort of wrap this all up and bring
it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at these dynamic model fits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our height model, there was not really
any improvement with the dynamic model
[SPEAKER_02]: over the static model at the final
measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did see a slight improvement about
a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're predicting a week before side
dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a slightly better chance
of predicting nitrogen status.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the NDVI, we saw about a 50%
improvement in the accuracy of the dynamic
[SPEAKER_02]: model versus the static model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get quite as much of a benefit
from going earlier, but there was still a
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The overall fit is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the limitations of how this study
went.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ones is just the noisy spectral
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just inherently noisy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you saw how we're doing it on here
on a boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were pretty accurate about our heights
and things like that and aiming,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's just inherent challenges with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tiny cloud passing in front of the sun
when you're taking the measurement could
[SPEAKER_02]: really affect that spectral reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did average it over multiple
measurements to sort of take care of that
[SPEAKER_02]: as best we could, but there's still a lot
of noise in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we didn't look at that I
think would be really helpful is looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at the differences between site years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is site years from one half of
the field to the other with the different
planting dates, but also between the
different sites that is Ithaca versus
Canada.
Even looking at our previous years and
seeing the differences there.
There are inherently gonna be differences
in precipitation, the amount of gene that
they're starting with in the first couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a really big difference on the
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that needs to be
looked at a little bit more deeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, as I mentioned in the
beginning, we are not looking at yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, because this is sort of a
paramount issue for any agronomic
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment, ultimately somebody wants to
know, a farmer wants to know, how does
this affect my bottom line?
How does this affect my yield?
Is it gonna hurt my yield?
Is this gonna be a waste of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we use the broader body of work that
we have, the broader body of data that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've gathered from this project,
which actually goes through the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: season, then we can start teasing out the
yield impact and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the implications for future work,
as I mentioned, we wanna look at using
[SPEAKER_02]: satellite data to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: As fun as it was hauling a ladder through
seven foot tall corn, I would love it if I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you, I don't know many
farmers who would be really willing or
[SPEAKER_02]: even have the time to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So drones are great if you have access to
one, that can be a really great way to
sort of gather some of this data.
But ultimately it would be, having this
public access satellite data would be
really powerful for sort of making this
predictive.
Ultimately, what we'd like to do is make
these high resolution descriptive end
maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can map out your field at three
meter resolution and know where it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: less nitrogen, where it's gonna need more,
just based on this sort of predicted
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen status using NNI, as mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'd like to thank you all
for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to my advisors, Professor
Longchamp, Professor Van Ness,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as Bill Potts, a lot of the
spectral data, the entire team at
Agriculture and Agriculture Canada,
the entire Longchamp's lab, past and
present, they've all been a part of this
project and have been tremendously
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as the Cornell Institute for
Digital Agriculture for providing some
funding for this project.
And then Cornell Farm Services for all
their awesome help in getting our fields
prepped and helping with all the
management of the actual agronomy of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'd like to thank all of
you for being here and thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Harold at the very end,
and so I was already thinking to ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: how this might integrate with the
adapt-end approach, which for that side
[SPEAKER_01]: dress date, you'll give, because of having
followed the weather, the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and so forth, is gonna give
some estimate of the nitrogen status and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a complementarity to this to,
I mean, you're being more spatially that's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about, obviously, that's one aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you thought of some integration
we'd adapt in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, this is something we talked
about a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could essentially be another piece of
that, another way to enhance the sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: reliability of that, or enhance the
accuracy of the sort of predictions that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's gonna take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this could be a really important
piece of that, taking some of that dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: data, as opposed to just a single entity
of dynamic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that could be helpful in that
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the grass, the idea is
basically that we use growth rate as an
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator of nitrogen status, because
nitrogen status is probably what
[SPEAKER_00]: determines our growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you thought about other factors
that can be close to growth rate at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point, like moisture status, some of the
new limitations, something that can affect
[SPEAKER_00]: your measurements of your station?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, because like I said,
especially between the different site
[SPEAKER_02]: years, we're gonna have differences in the
amount of GDP that's accumulated early in
[SPEAKER_02]: the season, moisture differences,
soil differences, weeds can be a big
[SPEAKER_02]: factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there are a number of other
factors that I think should be explored to
[SPEAKER_00]: really make this a more robust model.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used, the only difference between
varieties was between Canada and us.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of our years being the same
variety of corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that'd actually be a really
great thing to look at and see,
[SPEAKER_02]: does a variety that typically is going to
be shorter, do we see the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd be a really great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like, we didn't see much difference
between the last height and the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate for the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, maybe the growth rate
was more stable across varieties than the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual height if you have shorter,
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you very much.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
