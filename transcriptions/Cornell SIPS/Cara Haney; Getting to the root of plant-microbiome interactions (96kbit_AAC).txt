[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really fun to be back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only was I an undergrad here,
I was a plant science major.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I took the majority of my undergrad
classes in this building.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I saw Plant Science 404,
I was like, I'm sure I've been in that
[SPEAKER_05]: room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard many, many seminars in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really fun to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for most of my career, as you can
imagine, being a plant science major in
[SPEAKER_05]: this department, I've been really
interested in host-microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And across my career, I've been really
interested in sort of the continuum and
[SPEAKER_05]: the spectrum of host-microbe and
host-pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so symbiosis, I define in sort of its
classical definition, which means living
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm getting a little cut off at the
bottom there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it includes pathogens, mutualists,
and commensals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm going to use it to mean sort of
all living together interactions,
[SPEAKER_05]: including your mutualistic symbioses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been really interested in how
host and microbes navigate this continuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do hosts get to decide?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do microbes decide?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how, when they come together,
does that interaction determine the
[SPEAKER_05]: outcome of this interaction?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from my time in my PhD work,
I learned that these changes can actually
[SPEAKER_05]: occur over very short evolutionary
distances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Agrobacterium, our plant pathogen,
and Sinorhizobium, a mutualist,
[SPEAKER_05]: are actually very closely related.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the box cut off down here is
Sinorhizobium, which is very closely
[SPEAKER_05]: related to Agrobacterium, which is also in
the box that's a plant pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you make a synteny plot of these,
I don't know if I can actually pull that
[SPEAKER_05]: down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not the way that works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK, you can see it over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's close down the bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you point at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, on this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many computers and screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you plot the genomes of
Agrobacterium here and Sinorhizobium,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can see that they're actually very
highly conserved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each dot is a protein coding gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that if you line them up,
they actually align quite well with a few
[SPEAKER_05]: exceptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But over an evolutionary distance where
you can line up genomes, we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: mutualist and a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that suggests that relatively small
genomic changes can drive these major
[SPEAKER_05]: transitions in lifestyles between
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm not advancing.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually, my interest in these sorts of
questions started here in this department.
[SPEAKER_05]: And often in this very building.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have used this slide before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even make it just for this talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started working on this very famous
plant pathogen, LeapLite, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: devastating pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's about as far from rhizobia legume
and AM fungi as you can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a brief interlude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, one of my first classes that I
took in this department was as a freshman.
[SPEAKER_05]: My faculty advisor suggested that I take
plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went into Bill's class.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first day, everybody was talking
about our genes and Agrobacterium
[SPEAKER_05]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had no idea what was going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went up to Bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you remember this story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went up to Bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't think I should be
in this class, because I have no idea
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, OK, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, Kara Haney.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, oh, you're Irish.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only human.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, well, if you're born here
because of a plant pathogen, you should
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely be in this class.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it turns out that that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had no idea at the time,
but my own personal family history was
[SPEAKER_05]: shaped by plant microinteraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my dad's family fled Ireland during the
Irish Potato Famine in the late 1880s and
[SPEAKER_05]: immigrated to North America at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I worked in Bill's lab and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from this, there's been a few things
that really have stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is that plant microbes have
shaped human history.
[SPEAKER_05]: But second, within this pathogen,
a single pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've talked about spectrum of pathogens
having multiple lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_05]: A single pathogen can have multiple
lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bicoflora is a case where they have
this biotrophic stage where they look like
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not even doing anything to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they suddenly kill the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that I often mention from
this is that you can also have tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll come back to that at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with tomatoes and potatoes and late
blight, sometimes you see the fruits are
[SPEAKER_05]: perfectly healthy on the tomatoes and the
leaves are dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the potato tubers will be completely
rotten and the leaves look healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there seems to be something around
tissue specificity that I have kept with
[SPEAKER_05]: me through my career.
[SPEAKER_05]: So about the time I graduated,
I heard a seminar by a new professor that
[SPEAKER_05]: was being recruited into the department,
Maria Harrison.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I suddenly was like, there's this
whole other world of plant microbe
[SPEAKER_05]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so inspired by working on the other
extreme, I went and worked with Rhizobia
[SPEAKER_05]: legum symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And an amazing thing about this system is
that you can do genetics in a way that is
[SPEAKER_05]: really difficult with potatoes,
more feasible with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this mutualistic interaction,
you can screen for mutants that lose the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to form nodules and that have lost
the nitrogen fixing symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here you still have Rhizobia in these
nodules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a lot of questions that
arose about how does the plant control
[SPEAKER_05]: this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the plant avoid Rhizobia becoming
a pathogen, taking more nutrients than it
[SPEAKER_05]: can afford to share?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how do plants actually avoid
being parasitized by these microbes?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, as I mentioned, are pathogens
and mutualists really so different as
[SPEAKER_05]: these are very closely related to
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in Sharon's lab, I really started
thinking about this continuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's best exemplified with
these alpha proteobacteria, as I
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned, where we have Sinorhizobium and
Agrobacterium as close relatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even more amazingly, these are more
closely related to each other than they
[SPEAKER_05]: are to Bradyrhizobium, which is another
nitrogen fixing mutualist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sinorhizobium is more closely related
to Brucellia, which is a pathogen of
[SPEAKER_05]: animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it turns out that pathogens and
mutualists have shared mechanisms to
[SPEAKER_05]: infect very different hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sinorhizobium is here infecting a bean
cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brucellia is here infecting a macrophage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for virulence, they both require some
shared concern and serve ancestral
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanisms that are likely there to evade
or suppress host immunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so confronted with the same challenge
of how do you protect yourself from
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes, whether it's a pathogen or a
mutualist, plants and animals have
[SPEAKER_05]: actually convergently evolved similar
solutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here are plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have things like flagellin receptors
that can activate defense signaling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Animals have actually convergently evolved
similar pathways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so confronted with the same challenge
and given the same molecular toolbox,
[SPEAKER_05]: plants and animals can both sense
pathogens and mutualists, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens, non-self and non-an immune
response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so microbes likely have evolved to
circumvent these pathways using similar
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my lab thinks about sort of two
symbiotic continuums.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is over actually probably evolutionary
time from free living to symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So microbes as they from the environments
have to colonize hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to actually circumvent these
very specialized adaptations in immunity
[SPEAKER_05]: to colonize a host.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those adaptations might generally
allow things like Brucellia or
[SPEAKER_05]: Agrobacterium to be host associated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the specific adaptations might be
more recently evolved that allow a common
[SPEAKER_05]: ancestor of Brucellia, Agrobacterium and
Cytorizobium all host associated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then more recent adaptations determine
whether it's a pathogen or a mutualist
[SPEAKER_05]: along this continuum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a model that my lab thinks
about a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, how do you become symbiotic?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you're symbiotic,
how do you become a pathogen, a mutualist
[SPEAKER_05]: or a commensal?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so today I'm gonna tell you three
stories from the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I'm not gonna talk about is sort
of common innovations that allow symbiotic
[SPEAKER_05]: ancestors to become symbiotic,
although that's something we're really
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna talk about once you're
symbiotic, how bacteria can move along
[SPEAKER_05]: this symbiotic continuum of lifestyles
from pathogenic to mutualist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what are the mechanisms that drive
those transitions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, does the host have any say?
[SPEAKER_05]: So can hosts actually detect and enrich
for specific beneficial microbes?
[SPEAKER_05]: And can they do so without enriching for
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_05]: And a similar question, are hosts able to
distinguish closely related pathogens and
[SPEAKER_05]: mutualists in the context of the
microbiome where things like effectors
[SPEAKER_05]: might not be playing as much of a role?
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Maria suggested, my lab uses
Arabidopsis as a model for microbiome
[SPEAKER_05]: studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for many of the same reasons that you
all use it for immunity studies or those
[SPEAKER_05]: of you that do use it for other
host-pathogen interactions, it's a great
[SPEAKER_05]: system for forward and reverse genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our validated reference plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much of what we've learned in immunity
or flowering time have translated to other
[SPEAKER_05]: crop plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Importantly, the microbiome community of
Arabidopsis at a very high taxonomic level
[SPEAKER_05]: resembles crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is a non-nodulating,
non-arbuscular plant but if you look at
[SPEAKER_05]: the microbiome composition, at least at
the phylum level, it's very similar to our
[SPEAKER_05]: crop plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is rice and corn here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I always like to remember that
Arabidopsis is a wild plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not domesticated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the natural variation and the tools
that we have in Arabidopsis are
[SPEAKER_05]: Arabidopsis adapting with its local
microbiota to its local environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't necessarily lost those
interactions during domestication as we
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially have with some of our crop
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I started working on the
microbiome and trying to ask questions
[SPEAKER_05]: about sort of microbes moving a lot in
this continuum, I sort of took a page from
[SPEAKER_05]: all that I learned in this department and
the power of things like Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_05]: stringy Arabidopsis defines, or
Pseudomonas stringy spado, defined
[SPEAKER_05]: effectors and plant disease resistance
genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I decided to focus just on a single
microbe associating with Arabidopsis and
[SPEAKER_05]: we use Pseudomonas fluorescens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is that it's enriched in
the plant rice this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really good at colonizing plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beneficial to plants so it can
protect them from pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we know the outcome of that
interaction matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's there, plants are more disease
resistant and they also promote growth
[SPEAKER_05]: through a variety of nutrient and hormone
related mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really interesting because its
function can't be inferred from taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at a tree of Pseudomonas
and then try to predict what they're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: be doing, it actually doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that makes it really interesting
for these sorts of studies and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: genetically tractable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Pseudomonas like the alpha
proteobacteria actually shows those
[SPEAKER_05]: patterns of host association and lifestyle
transitions within a single genus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so within Pseudomonas, we have
Origenosa which are opportunistic
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens of actually plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's reports of Pseudomonas,
Origenosa causing disease under very
[SPEAKER_05]: stressful field conditions like heat waves
or poor soil quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Pseudomonas syringae which you all
know a lot about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that are plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Pseudomonas fluorescens which are
described as both plant and animal
[SPEAKER_05]: symbionts and free living.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so within this group, we study them
because first they're all host associated
[SPEAKER_05]: and Origenosa is really fun because it's
both plant and animal associated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna talk about that work today
but we consider that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today I'm gonna tell you about Pseudomonas
fluorescens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wanted to understand across this
continuum from mutualist to commensal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something that's not like living with
plants not necessarily causing harm or
[SPEAKER_05]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: How quickly can those transitions occur
within this group?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we started, this is actually the
first postdoc to join the lab and Brian
[SPEAKER_05]: Melnick, he asked within this group of
actually well-described mutualistic
[SPEAKER_05]: Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are plant growth promoters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they all promote growth or do some of
them not promote growth?
[SPEAKER_05]: And can we sort of understand the genomic
changes that happen over these short
[SPEAKER_05]: distances that would drive that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we started with our favorite lab
model strain is WCS365.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice plant growth promoter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within this group, I just wanna point out
for anybody that does 16S sequencing,
[SPEAKER_05]: these are 99% identical by 16S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are very, very closely related
and often some of these would be called
[SPEAKER_05]: the same ASC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically indistinguishable by 16S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Pseudomonas sort of species
complex would be this whole group,
[SPEAKER_05]: Pseudomonas fluorescens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we found that was quite
surprising was not only did not all of
[SPEAKER_05]: these strains promote growth, some of them
kill plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Ryan, actually one of the first
strains he tested in the lab was this N2C3
[SPEAKER_05]: strain, which is within that Brassica CRM
group.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only did it not promote growth,
it kills Arabidopsis under germ-free
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent a long time being convinced that
Ryan just didn't know how to grow plants
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was something he was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when he did this with controls of
other strains that do not kill,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's clearly something unique about this
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you a few graphs like this that
are just death quantified.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's our N2C3 pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these under these conditions
actually don't promote growth super well,
[SPEAKER_05]: because this is rich media, but they do
cause changes in lateral root
[SPEAKER_05]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turns out that N2C3 is a quite broad
host range pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tested it on, this is rice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tested on tomatoes and poppies and
whatever people had lying around in the
[SPEAKER_05]: lab to put in their gardens and it
basically killed everything that we could.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Ryan actually came from a genomics
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as part of what he was doing in the
lab, he was building a comparative
[SPEAKER_05]: genomics pipeline to try to identify
genomic traits that would be unique to one
[SPEAKER_05]: strain and not another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the idea here is that if we take
the genome of our beneficial strains and
[SPEAKER_05]: compare to the genomes of our pathogen,
we should have most of the same,
[SPEAKER_05]: our core pseudomonas genome, but the genes
required for pathogenesis or mutualism or
[SPEAKER_05]: commensalism should be unique to each of
those strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he built actually a pseudomonas
pangenome where he did all by all
[SPEAKER_05]: comparisons and then just generated one
giant pseudomonas genome that now we can
[SPEAKER_05]: compare each genome to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes this a much easier problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these tools are available if anybody
is interested in the pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_05]: pangenome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when he did this, we found a very
conspicuous 143 KB genomic islands that
[SPEAKER_05]: was unique to our pseudomonas pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was inserted in otherwise a very
conserved region of the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turns out it encodes syringomycin,
syringopeptin, which you may have heard of
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was first described in
pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so these are toxins that cause disease
on many plant hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is pseudomonas syringae of
bean that causes disease in a
[SPEAKER_05]: syringomycin, syringopeptin dependent
manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the wild type strain, mutants that
don't make the toxins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Disease goes away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another pseudomonas syringae on
cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the syringomycin, syringopeptin
mutants no longer have a reduction in
[SPEAKER_05]: disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we deleted these in our pathogenic
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see syringomycin and
syringopeptin work synergistically to
[SPEAKER_05]: cause disease on Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you delete either of them,
you lose disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that seems to be responsible for
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a pseudomonas fluorescence,
not a pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went back to our pseudomonas
tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that within pseudomonas
fluorescence, these genes actually occur
[SPEAKER_05]: quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here's pseudomonas syringae.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these are all kind of the
pseudomonas fluorescence clade at large.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that there's some like
pseudomonas tuscovaginae, which is known
[SPEAKER_05]: to cause race sheath rot that fall within
the pseudomonas fluorescence sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: species complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some are actually very closely
related to our pathogen that we found,
[SPEAKER_05]: like pseudomonas quurgata causes tomato
pythnecrosis, are squarely nestled in this
[SPEAKER_05]: fluorescence clade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems that this is actually
quite widespread within pseudomonas and is
[SPEAKER_05]: moving around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to understand more about the
inheritance in this group because it looks
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one group that looks like it's got
it, one group that hasn't, was this kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of one horizontal transfer acquisition
event that was just kind of lost in a few
[SPEAKER_05]: strains here or something more complicated
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we took advantage of the vast
genomic information available for
[SPEAKER_05]: pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you zoom in just on that brassica
serum clade, so these are all 99%
[SPEAKER_05]: identical by 16S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the presence of that
syringomycin syringopeptin island.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that there's been multiple
acquisition and loss events over a very
[SPEAKER_05]: short evolutionary distance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's not like, there was
probably an acquisition event here that
[SPEAKER_05]: resulted in all of these strains having
it, but you can't explain this pattern
[SPEAKER_05]: here without multiple gain and loss
events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems like this island is moving
very, being gained and lost very readily
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout pseudomonas fluorescence
genomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to sort of validate that this
gene or gene cluster indeed predicts
[SPEAKER_05]: virulence, we got our hands on a number of
strains that have or don't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the ones in green don't have the
islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones in red do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to very closely correlate
with virulence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're really intrigued by this,
this idea that maybe you could have a
[SPEAKER_05]: lifestyle transition over not the distance
of agrobacterium to senorhizobium,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just over a single strain gaining and
losing a single island.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wondered, is that just it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an island that's moving around and
causing these lifestyle transitions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it something more complicated?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a beautiful example from Jeff
Chang's lab showing that rotococcus
[SPEAKER_05]: through gaining a single virulence plasmid
can actually transition from a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: commensal, so associated with commensals,
to a pathogen just with acquiring a single
[SPEAKER_05]: plasmid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wondered, are there other
genomic changes that correlate with
[SPEAKER_05]: lifestyle or is it just the presence,
absence of this island?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we did a genome-wide association
where we looked for genes that correlated
[SPEAKER_05]: with presence, absence of this island.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to our surprise, we found several
genome-wide changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is our syringomycin,
syringopeptin island here in red.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found two additional, they were
annotated as putative pathogenicity
[SPEAKER_05]: islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still don't know what they're doing,
but at least one might be a toxin that are
[SPEAKER_05]: nearly perfectly correlated with our
lipopeptide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we found two islands and a
putative effector that are nearly
[SPEAKER_05]: perfectly inversely correlated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is probably too small to see,
but this one here is actually a type 3
[SPEAKER_05]: secretion island that is almost uniquely
present in the commensal, not the
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is DAPG, which is a known
antifungal compound made by Pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been implicated in suppressive
soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have two sort of configurations
of the genome, one with this syringomycin,
[SPEAKER_05]: syringopeptin, and then one with type 3
secretion and DAPG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we think that Pseudomonas has kind
of converged on two solutions for plants
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually fungal association.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't mention, but the syringomycin,
syringopeptin, lipopeptide islands is also
[SPEAKER_05]: antifungal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one version is lipopeptides plus
these two pathogenicity islands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other is type 3 secretion
plus DAPG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all strains that have these,
they end up in the same genomic location.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have evidence that they're being
gained and lost through homologous
[SPEAKER_05]: recombination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems that Pseudomonas
fluorescence has two lifestyles that are
[SPEAKER_05]: transitioning over very short evolutionary
distances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems that even within very
closely related plants, associated
[SPEAKER_05]: strains, you can get these transitions
with just gain and loss of a single
[SPEAKER_05]: island.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm going to switch gears a little
bit and talk about the sort of role of the
[SPEAKER_05]: host in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so do the hosts have any say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they specifically enrich for
beneficial microbes or even specific
[SPEAKER_05]: groups of microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they're enriching,
how do they filter out which ones are good
[SPEAKER_01]: and bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants do something really cool,
which is that under certain stress
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions, I think my slides got missing
a slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I got shuffled here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So plants and animals, it's known that a
normal microbiome structure is really
[SPEAKER_05]: important for host health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our gut, if we end up with an
altered microbiome community that can make
[SPEAKER_05]: us really sick, we're associated with more
susceptibility to autoimmune diseases and
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the same is true for plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the slide I'm missing, you would see
that if there's a plant that's missing,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually it's a big component of its
innate immune system, you can get disease
[SPEAKER_05]: from microbiota.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants also do something cool where they
can specifically enrich for beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the classic example of this is
suppressive soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something I learned about in plant
pathology class, there were two mechanisms
[SPEAKER_05]: of disease resistance, R genes and
suppressive soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Suppressive soils were not well
understood, but this is a phenomenon where
[SPEAKER_05]: upon sensing a pathogen, plants can enrich
for groups of microbes that can suppress
[SPEAKER_05]: that pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This hasn't been described in animals and
it turns out it's not unique to biotic
[SPEAKER_05]: stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants can also do this in response to
abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's been some beautiful work
from Devin Coleman-Durr and the Sundari
[SPEAKER_05]: Zin lab at UC Davis, showing that under
drought stress, plants also shift their
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is drought-stressed grass
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get this massive enrichment of
streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like bacteria in suppressive soils,
streptomyces are sufficient to protect
[SPEAKER_05]: against drought stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so both suppressive soils and the
drought example suggest that under biotic
[SPEAKER_05]: or abiotic stress, plants might actually
be able to dynamically enrich for these
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial microbes to help protect
against those stresses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're really interested,
can plants enrich for pseudomonas under
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions where pseudomonas would be
beneficial?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, can they tell apart,
can they enrich for just our beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: pseudomonas and not the pathogenic ones?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to get at this, genetic screening
with microbiome has been very difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: because microbiome phenotypes are often
hard and labor-intensive to screen for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we decided to do was to take
advantage of a mutant collection that had
[SPEAKER_05]: been developed inside Osibel's lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a really unique mutant
collection because it was screened for
[SPEAKER_05]: root immunity phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so these are mutants that when you add
a plant hormone that normally suppresses
[SPEAKER_05]: root immunity, so pattern-triggered
immunity, they're actually insensitive to
[SPEAKER_05]: that hormone response.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the details aren't super important for
these purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The original paper was described here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is that these mutants are
specific to root immunity mutants involved
[SPEAKER_05]: in pattern-triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had a collection of
uncharacterized mutants, and we
[SPEAKER_05]: re-screened them for ability to support
pseudomonas fluorescence in
[SPEAKER_05]: mono-association.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do this by growing Arabidopsis in
48 well plates, and then we can add
[SPEAKER_05]: pseudomonas fluorescence expressing GFP,
and then read pseudomonas fluorescence GFP
[SPEAKER_05]: with a plate reader as a proxy for
pseudomonas abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a really easy way to
quickly quantify pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so doing this, we found that our
mutants, we found three that have higher
[SPEAKER_05]: levels of pseudomonas, and we found three
that have lower levels of pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have preprints about these two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you about HSM 13 today that
has more pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this plant mutant, HSM 13, has more
pseudomonas in mono-association,
[SPEAKER_05]: which just Arabidopsis pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the first thing that we did was to
take it and plant it in natural soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: see if it also had more pseudomonas when
there's a complex community presence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pseudomonas fluorescence gets its name
because it's fluorescence under
[SPEAKER_05]: iron-limiting conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so HSM 13 has about 10 times more
pseudomonas fluorescence per gram of root
[SPEAKER_05]: than wild-type plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is bulk soil, which has
relatively low pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is quantified here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is CFU fluorescent colonies per
gram of root.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can also do microbiome sequencing to
look at the entire community and see if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just pseudomonas that's different or
if there are larger community changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we actually found that wild-type
and the HSM 13 mutants look quite similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can see this is a principal
component analysis and they separate along
[SPEAKER_05]: this axis, although that's a smaller
portion of the variation than this axis,
[SPEAKER_05]: which explains bulk soil versus the plant
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we looked at the taxonomic
levels, they're actually quite similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is phylum level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we looked at individual taxa
that were different and explained the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference we see here, it was largely
limited to this family pseudomonas AC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a relative abundance plot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some other taxa that are
different, but the most dramatic change
[SPEAKER_05]: was actually enrichment of pseudomonas,
where we have way higher in HSM 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interestingly, there's some signatures of
dysbiosis in this mutants, although it's
[SPEAKER_05]: very pseudomonas specific here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's much less diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get a drop in total bacterial
diversity by a number of OTUs and also
[SPEAKER_05]: Shannon Diversity Index.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wanted is this microbiome from
HSM 13?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a beneficial community or is this
sort of a dysbiotic community that can
[SPEAKER_05]: make plants sick?
[SPEAKER_05]: And first author of this paper,
Yi, did a really clever microbiome
[SPEAKER_05]: transplant experiment where he grew either
HSM 13 or wild-type plants in natural
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he let the plant shift the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So enrich for whatever it's going to
enrich for, then he removed the plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: put wild-type plants in both soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then asked what the effect of just the
soil is on plant health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in doing this, he found that the
wild-type plants and wild-type soil were
[SPEAKER_05]: much smaller than wild-type plants in the
HSM 13 soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see this correlates quite
nicely with increased pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_05]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's more pseudomonas in these soils
until you get growth promotion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems at least that the HSM 13
microbiome isn't harmful under these
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions, although we're enriching for
pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll come back to that later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because here I'm talking about pseudomonas
as one group of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were able to map HSM 13,
and it encodes Phronia kinase.
[SPEAKER_05]: So HSM 13 has a point mutation in the
kinase domain of a actually well-studied
[SPEAKER_05]: receptor-like kinase called Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, HSM 13 is for dash eight,
which shows you that seven other people
[SPEAKER_05]: have found Phronia out of screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a very well-studied RLK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't go into the details because
it's published, but this is just showing
[SPEAKER_05]: that it indeed is Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does Phronia do?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a master regulator of immunity and
development, which is great and not great
[SPEAKER_05]: in many ways, because then you have to
kind of filter through all of the ways
[SPEAKER_05]: that Phronia could be affecting your
particular phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it does have a role in development.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were able to kind of uncouple that from
our role in microbiome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to go into that in
detail, but in immunity, Phronia has a few
[SPEAKER_05]: known roles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one is that it's known to interact with
BAC1 and FLS2, which are receptors for
[SPEAKER_05]: microbe-associated molecular patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we thought maybe if you lose
pattern-triggered immunity, you would get
[SPEAKER_05]: increased pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, it's known to be a negative
regulator of MIK2, which regulates
[SPEAKER_05]: diazimonic acid signaling, which
antagonizes salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that could also result in increased
pseudomonas fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it also regulates basal levels of
ROS in roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is reactive oxygen that's just
involved in normal growth and development.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not your ROS-burst-inducible ROS.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just ROS that's signaling and
involved in cross-linking cell walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we thought that that reactive
oxygen regulation could also be normally
[SPEAKER_05]: inhibiting pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we tested mutants in all of these
pathways to try to see if loss of any of
[SPEAKER_05]: these pathways affected rhizosphere
pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, we found that knocking out
pattern-triggered immunity in single
[SPEAKER_05]: mutants does not affect rhizosphere
pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have now tested a BAC1, CIRC1,
BBC, BAC1, BIC1, CIRC1 triple mutant,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get a very slight increase,
but it still doesn't explain the Phronia
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jasmonic acid signaling has no effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually only when we tested RBOH-D
and F, which are involved in reactive
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen production, that we saw an increase
in pseudomonas that's starting to reach
[SPEAKER_05]: the level of the Phronia mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is reactive oxygen staining.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is wild type, and then this is the
Phronia mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these are the wild type and
Phronia mutant with pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so again, you can see that the level
of reactive oxygen very nicely correlates
[SPEAKER_05]: with the level of pseudomonas in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the green here is more reactive oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we have less reactive oxygen
on Phronia, that's when we have more
[SPEAKER_05]: pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to test if this was really the
pathway that was involved, Yi
[SPEAKER_05]: overexpressed this ROP2, which is
downstream of Phronia, to ask if this
[SPEAKER_05]: could bypass the need for Phronia and
regulating reactive oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here's our parental line and then
the HSM13 mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you overexpressed this ROP in the
HSM13 mutants, you have a dramatic
[SPEAKER_05]: reduction in the amount of pseudomonas,
suggesting if you increase the level of
[SPEAKER_05]: reactive oxygen, you can actually decrease
the level of pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that suggests that indeed it's this
pathway and not something related to PTI
[SPEAKER_05]: that's regulating rhizoste or pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So interestingly, it turns out that fungal
pathogens and nematodes can make the
[SPEAKER_05]: ligand for Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's two beautiful papers that
show that nematodes and fungal pathogens
[SPEAKER_05]: can make Ralph peptides, which are the
mimics of Ralph peptides, which are the
[SPEAKER_05]: ligand for Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they likely do this because by
messing with Phronia, they can actually
[SPEAKER_05]: mess with the JA pathway and promote
susceptibility to themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So jasmonic acid is required for
resistance to both fungal pathogens and
[SPEAKER_05]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we thought that was really cool
because this could potentially be a way
[SPEAKER_05]: for plants to sense these fungal pathogens
and nematodes and then enrich for
[SPEAKER_05]: pseudomonas, which has been implicated in
suppressive soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we asked if just adding Ralph
peptides, so the ligand for Phronia,
[SPEAKER_05]: was sufficient to recruit pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did this in a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first we tried adding exogenous Ralph
peptides.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, there's at least 33 of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just picked a couple that had been
implicated in immune signaling and were
[SPEAKER_05]: like the fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've got a small but significant
increase in pseudomonas with one of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: Ralph 33 here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was dependent on Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't see the increase in the
Phronia mutant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also overexpressed one of the Ralph
peptides, and you get an increase in
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosteus pseudomonas just with the
presence of the ligand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we think that fungal and nematode
pathogens may make Ralph peptides,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they do so with the goal of inhibiting
jasmonic acid signaling and promoting
[SPEAKER_05]: susceptibility to themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then plants may be guarding this
pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: By downregulating reactive oxygen,
basal reactive oxygen levels, which in
[SPEAKER_05]: turn results in more pseudomonas that
could protect them from these fungal
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we've got 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I've told you two stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, that bacteria can transition over
short evolutionary distances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that plants can sort of generally
enrich for pseudomonas that results in
[SPEAKER_05]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two things are kind of even in the
lab, a little bit at odds with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have pseudomonas as one group that's
all beneficial, and then pseudomonas where
[SPEAKER_05]: we have pathogens and mutualists that are
super closely related.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a question that I think naturally
follows is, can plants tell these apart?
[SPEAKER_05]: When they're enriching for pseudomonas,
are they able to just enrich the
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial ones?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we first asked this using our
Phronia mutant to ask, in this mutant,
[SPEAKER_05]: are you only enriching for beneficial
pseudomonas?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here we have pseudomonas
commensals, pseudomonas pathogens,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then non-pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in green are wild type plants,
and blue are Phronia mutant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can see commensals all enriched
in Phronia, with the exception of this
[SPEAKER_05]: one, which I think is super interesting
and we don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the pathogens are also enriched in
Phronia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is pseudomonas syringae here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our opportunistic pathogens,
like the N2C3 I told you about,
[SPEAKER_05]: and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems like that's not,
it can't tell them apart, at least in this
[SPEAKER_05]: mono-association, that Phronia is
enriching for pathogens and mutualists.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, pseudomonas are not great soil
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if anybody knows of cases in the
literature where pseudomonas are root or
[SPEAKER_05]: soil pathogens, I'd be really interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems that generally, they're leaf
and stem pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just to sort of illustrate this,
on plates, if you add DC3000 to
[SPEAKER_05]: Arabidopsis roots, right, not on the
leaves, you get stunting of plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: even with DC3000.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is our opportunistic
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you take Arabidopsis and you grow
them in natural soil and you drench the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil with DC3000, you get no disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have tried, like, and every time we
see a spot on the leaf, it's probably that
[SPEAKER_05]: it just kind of splashed onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that suggests that maybe there's
something about the soil community that is
[SPEAKER_05]: protected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a master's project from a
student in a lab who asked if just in
[SPEAKER_05]: binary interaction, so if you put a
commensal and a pathogenic pseudomonas on
[SPEAKER_05]: the same plants, do you get disease?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can you protect from the pathogen?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is N2C3, our pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nicole found that many commensals and
many that are closely related to the
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the pathogen on our tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this closely related commensal,
if you mix them on plants, actually the
[SPEAKER_05]: commensal wins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they protect against the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't true for all commensals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is another clade of pseudomonas
fluorescens here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you mix those, they actually don't
protect against the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this suggests that either some of
the commensals can outcompete the pathogen
[SPEAKER_05]: or kill the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the plants actually can somehow enrich
for just the commensals and not the
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we first tried to see if there was
direct antagonism.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can the protective commensals directly
kill the pathogen or inhibit their
[SPEAKER_05]: virulence?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we did a bunch of in vitro
antagonism tests and we couldn't find any
[SPEAKER_05]: evidence of direct killing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also a quorum quenching assay
because our pathogen uses a quorum
[SPEAKER_05]: dependent virulence mechanism and the
commensal can't quench the quorum cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a signal of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that starts to make us think that
maybe it's something about the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So either the commensal is just more fit
in growing in plant root exudates,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the plants can actually detect the
pathogen and kill it and not the
[SPEAKER_05]: commensal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is recent work that we've just
posted a preprint of from David Tombs,
[SPEAKER_05]: who's a postdoc in the lab that just
started his whole lab at Florida State.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he sort of asked if the commensal
and pathogen if there were differences in
[SPEAKER_05]: kinetics in vitro versus in vivo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, asking is it plant specific?
[SPEAKER_05]: He found that when he competed the
pathogen and commensal in vitro,
[SPEAKER_05]: so our commensal is in gray, the pathogen
is in blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in vitro, they always grow at the same
rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is just total bacterial growth
in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then pathogen and commensal have the
same final OD and very similar growth
[SPEAKER_05]: kinetics when competing in culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in plants, our commensal always
wins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here's the commensal in gray and
the pathogen in blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this suggests that the competition
is indeed plant dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, can either be plant immune
related, or just that the commensal is
[SPEAKER_05]: better able to colonize plant roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so David wondered, first decided to
test, could the plant distinguish these?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he used immunity reporters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are immune inducible genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reporter lines developed by Nico
Gildner's lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're nuclear localized
transcriptional reporters that are turned
[SPEAKER_05]: on in response to mamps and damps
primarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: So David asked if the commensal and
pathogen could activate these reporters
[SPEAKER_05]: and found that only the commensal could
activate, or sorry, only the pathogen
[SPEAKER_05]: could activate the reporters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's here with these blue dots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this indeed suggests that the plant can
detect or distinguish the pathogen from
[SPEAKER_05]: the commensal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next question is, how could that
happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: So both strains have similar mamps.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 99% identical by 16S.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have the same flagellin
sequence.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of their peptidoglycan biosynthesis
genes look indistinguishable as far as we
[SPEAKER_05]: can tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems unlikely they could tell them
apart by mamps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, our pathogen doesn't even have a
type II secretion system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the effectors are not likely
candidates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're really interested in how the
plant is able to sense the pathogen and
[SPEAKER_05]: mount this immune response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as I mentioned, if we sort of
return to our classic paradigm of immunity
[SPEAKER_05]: in plants, you have type III secretion
where plants could recognize the effectors
[SPEAKER_05]: or the consequences of those effectors,
but our pathogen doesn't have effectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also can recognize mamps and mounts
immune response, but our mamps are
[SPEAKER_05]: probably very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems that that's unlikely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think damage is probably our best bet,
because these are performing toxins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they can cause damage to the plant
cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe the plant could recognize
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to start to get at the answer to this,
David started looking at what genes were
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for this immune response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I'm showing you, instead of a
transcriptional reporter, a reactive
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: So another readout for immunity where we
have a dye that, when oxidized,
[SPEAKER_05]: so the presence of reactive oxygen is
luminescence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you get a peak when you get a
reactive oxygen burst and an immune
[SPEAKER_05]: response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you add flagellin, you get a
strong reactive oxygen burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you add our pathogen and commensal,
you actually get a weaker but still
[SPEAKER_05]: prominent reactive oxygen burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is just our baseline mock
treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so David asked, are there any plant
genes in sensing of mamps or damage that
[SPEAKER_05]: are responsible for this reactive oxygen
burst?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the idea that if this is a mamp
response, like a response to flagellin,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you knock out components of PTI,
and so we used a BAC1, BKK1, CIRC1 triple
[SPEAKER_05]: mutants, which is a number of co-receptors
for mamp and damp signaling, we can see if
[SPEAKER_05]: this response goes away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so first I'm showing you the commensal
with the wild type or the triple BAC1,
[SPEAKER_05]: BKK1, CIRC1 mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you add flagellin, you get this
peak.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then in the BAC1, BKK1, CIRC1 mutant,
it's down here at the bottom, the response
[SPEAKER_05]: completely goes away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our commensal, you get this peak
in blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the response again, like flagellin,
completely went away in the triple
[SPEAKER_05]: mutants, suggesting the reactive oxygen
burst we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the commensal is likely due to the
presence of things like flagellin or
[SPEAKER_05]: peptidoglycan in our inoculation preps.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when David did this with the
pathogen, we saw a decrease, but not a
[SPEAKER_05]: complete loss of a mean response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so again, flagellin in gray,
commensal is in red, and we see a decrease
[SPEAKER_05]: in the response in the BBC triple mutant,
but it doesn't go down to baseline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that suggests a little bit of the
response is likely because of mamps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a secondary part of the response
is independent of mamps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to highlight that the BAC1 is
a co-receptor for a number of the damage
[SPEAKER_05]: receptors, but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does sort of rule out a subset of
damage responses, but not damage
[SPEAKER_05]: completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this suggests that pathogens or
plants can distinguish pathogens from
[SPEAKER_05]: commensals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can sense the commensals through
mamps, and they can sense the pathogen
[SPEAKER_05]: through a second MAMP independent process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see that the presence or the
response is toxin dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is again, looking at gene
expression, now through qPCR instead of a
[SPEAKER_05]: reporter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you treat plants with, these are
two separate reporters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So MIB51 and PR5, which are both immunity
PTI responsive genes, our pathogen induces
[SPEAKER_05]: a response.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see PEP1, which is a damage
associated molecular pattern also induces
[SPEAKER_05]: a strong response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these responses are decreased in the
serangomycin, serangopeptin mutants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this suggests that the plants are
detecting the toxin or the consequences of
[SPEAKER_05]: the toxin, the damage from the toxin to
mountain immune response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we think that for commensals in the
rhizosphere, plants can distinguish
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens, but they may not rely on PTI or
ETI to do so because we haven't found any
[SPEAKER_05]: role for those in responding to our
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems like they're responding to the
toxins or potentially the damage those
[SPEAKER_05]: toxins cause to mountain immune response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to sort of summarize what I've told
you, I've shown you that small genomic
[SPEAKER_05]: changes over very short evolutionary
distances can result in really dramatic
[SPEAKER_05]: lifestyle differences in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that plants have mechanisms to kind of
sense their environments and then enrich
[SPEAKER_05]: for beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we think that when you're
enriching for beneficial microbes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need to have a way to avoid also
enriching for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to do that, plants can potentially
sense toxins or damage causing molecules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully, we're thinking that
they can mount an immune response
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically to target those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a really open question there is,
can they actually target their immune
response?
[SPEAKER_05]: So just the cells where those pathogens
would be and causing damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we are starting to think that
plants can regulate the microbiome by
[SPEAKER_05]: sensing damage or toxins or the Venn maps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this has some overlaps with
the paradigms of immunity that I learned
[SPEAKER_05]: in my pathology class many years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly damage and damage responses
have some overlap with PTI.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we really haven't considered
what immunity looks like in roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And given that all of these members of the
microbiome have similar maps, they may not
[SPEAKER_05]: have a vectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to start thinking about
maybe some new paradigm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is it that plants could actually
sense and regulate commensals to results
[SPEAKER_05]: in a community that's beneficial?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so with that, I'd like to thank the
folks in the lab that did the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried to highlight people as I went.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first story is the work of Ryan
Melnick, a former postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ferronia story is the work of Yi Song,
another former postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Nicole Wang and David Thoms
worked on sort of the last story on how
[SPEAKER_05]: plants can distinguish pathogens from
commensals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course our funding, and I would be
very happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you find a way to transfer the two
clusters from commensals into the
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogen, would you predict the pathogen
will lose its virulence?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I really want to do those
experiments.
[SPEAKER_05]: These islands are huge, so they've been
hard to move around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think we would predict just
based on the genomic sequence that the
[SPEAKER_05]: islands are incompatible in the same
genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you tried to put them all
together, they'd be lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: What could be driving that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may just be functional redundancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if both the syngomycin, syngopepfin,
and DAPG are antifungal, then maybe you
[SPEAKER_05]: just don't need both, and so they're lost
over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that's a strong enough
selection pressure to explain the really
[SPEAKER_05]: dramatic pattern we see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And amazingly, we've started looking for
this pattern now, and we see it with many
[SPEAKER_05]: other gene clusters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think the most prominent example
is with polyamine biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just small molecules that are
involved in signaling in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two pathways for spermidine
biosynthesis that have been described.
[SPEAKER_05]: And pseudomonas, all of them have one,
but not both.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see gain and loss over short
distances.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we want to do that experiment
with those islands, because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: smaller and easier to move around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can also select for them with
ability to break down polyamines.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we've gotten really interested
in what could be driving these patterns,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it seems too striking to just be
kind of, you get one, and then you kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: lose the other over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there needs to be active
counter-selection for one of them.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought the suppressive soil
phenomenon, where a damaged signal or a
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary, some kind of pathogen can allow
for enrichment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious if you've ever seen a case
where a commensal or mutualist kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mimics this pathogen signal especially
given the vast genomic data sets of some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pseudomonas species.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can see, say, a Ralph mimicking
protein or something that's being
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed by commensal, it seems like it'd
be a huge fitness advantage and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like a cheating-esque fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess you're asking in maybe in
pseudomonas or in commensal fungi,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they make Ralph-like peptides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't looked, but that's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it seems like commensal fungi
would also benefit from suppressing the J
[SPEAKER_05]: pathway maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think it's horizontal transfer
for these islands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, the gain and loss of
the islands, is it through horizontal gene
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like it's horizontal gene
transfer followed by homologous
[SPEAKER_05]: recombination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can see a few instances in the
paper that the island is more similar to
[SPEAKER_05]: the island in a distantly related species
than the rest of the genome, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: or then, sorry, more closely related to
distantly related species than to closely
[SPEAKER_05]: related strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can even find examples where the
island has been lost, leaving behind a
[SPEAKER_05]: lesion of homologous recombination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the inside of the genes, where it's
recombined, are more similar to a
[SPEAKER_05]: distantly related strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other gene is more closely
related to closely related strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can even see, like, it's happened
recently enough that we can see,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can trace the inheritance and make gene
trees of the genes in the island and the
[SPEAKER_05]: neighboring genes and see that they're
moving around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think it's like some sort of
integrative conjugate development?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like compartment or is it
extracellular and it's transforming into
[SPEAKER_03]: the bacteria?
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it's just homologous
recombination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no evidence of transposon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like phage or anything else,
whether it's conjugation followed by
[SPEAKER_05]: homologous recombination or
transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it's probably conjugation because
there's no evidence of phage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then pseudomonas are just not very
naturally competents, but they conjugate
[SPEAKER_05]: really readily.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can't tell how DNA is getting in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once it's there, it's homologous
recombination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, one last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you sort of crawled through other
metagenomic databases looking for similar
[SPEAKER_03]: islands that might have transferred to
more distant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think David Postock that just started
his own lab is really interested in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So toxins in general are so common in
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them are probably for,
you know, intermicrobial warfare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them are probably for hosts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some examples, like within
bacillus of toxins moving around over
[SPEAKER_05]: short distances, just when we look in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think there's enough of these
toxins that it actually could explain some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the differences and host associations.
[SPEAKER_03]: This specific one is pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is limited to pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a poor-forming toxin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's many other poor-forming toxins
that work through a similar mechanism,
[SPEAKER_05]: but are not similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask one question that came
from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for an excellent talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious how you captured these
beautiful images of the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think maybe, do you mean the,
you probably can't answer, but maybe these
[SPEAKER_05]: images from David on the immune reporters?
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, that we just have a, it's a flashed
in stereoscope that is actually not that
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive that David was able to image
these reporters on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, David's a cell biologist by
training.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
