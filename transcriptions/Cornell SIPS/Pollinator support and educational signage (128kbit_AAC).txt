[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kind of frame this, I think that
we started with the recognition that we
[SPEAKER_05]: had some shared needs, and we definitely
had some needs for new resources here at
[SPEAKER_05]: the county level, but realized that maybe
some of those resources would serve on a
[SPEAKER_05]: statewide level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we developed our pollinator garden,
I reached out to Sarah and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, we have some grant funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we collaborate on curated or
interpretive signage for these pollinator
[SPEAKER_05]: gardens?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't know if you all are kind
of like us in that a lot of what we do is
[SPEAKER_05]: what we can print on our printers and what
we can laminate on our laminators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's as big as it gets and as
designed as it gets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those kind of signs are not,
they're great, but they're not,
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't say, hey, this is a garden,
this is a learning space, come on in,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they flap in the wind and they float
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So recognizing that we had some parallel
needs and we could develop these shared
[SPEAKER_05]: resources, I polled a whole bunch of
people across the state and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, who's doing a pollinator garden this
year in terms of your extension duties and
[SPEAKER_05]: a number were, and would you like signage?
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on that, we launched into this
collaborative process, which like many
[SPEAKER_05]: other things sort of took longer than we
expected because life happens and then
[SPEAKER_05]: fairs happen and then people go,
you know, we're on vacations and it took a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of months, but we came up with some
really beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in doing that, also ended up
developing a shared photo library for
[SPEAKER_05]: other extension educators to use as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So out of it came this wonderful set of
products that I'm really excited to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to share with people, but along with
that are the parallel photos that people
[SPEAKER_05]: could be using and the parallel educators
resources that go along with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully it's something that you can
just pick up for your program and take
[SPEAKER_05]: what parts you need and it makes your life
easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So was that a good introduction,
Sarah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are storing a lot of stuff in box.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sarah, if you want, you could,
I'll be your clicker and you talk and I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: click on what you'd like me to show.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what you're about to look
at is that, like Jen just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: she polled lots of people around the
county to say, you know, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: concepts do you want to communicate in
your gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that created draft of text that
then I took and looked at and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I made some suggestions as to how to
organize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did is we came up with four
different signs with four different
[SPEAKER_01]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, do you mind clicking on
the pollinator paradise one first,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: These four signs are kind of like a menu
of, you could use all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use one or you can select the
ones that are most appropriate for what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're displaying in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, the pollinator paradise is kind
of the intro type of sign that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: gives the why behind, you know,
what is the significance of making your
[SPEAKER_01]: home landscape pollinator friendly?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're seeing right now is the
graphic layout for that particular sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has like a fun title that Jen came
up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, you know, explore this
garden to learn how you can create
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinator habitat at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our main idea pretty much for
all of the signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one in particular kind of gives
the overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in the paragraph, I won't read
everything word for word, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: paragraph following that, you know,
cites the significance for why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to have pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pollinate all the plants we depend on
for food and for healthy ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath that, it gives like a nice,
just basic, here's what pollinators need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the signs direct people to more
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of the four have QR codes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people have smartphones and like to
use their QR reader to access more
[SPEAKER_01]: information on a website, they could do
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main idea behind these signs is to
really entice people with beautiful images
[SPEAKER_01]: and not look intimidating, like there's
too much text all jumbled together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people can kind of pick and choose the
information they want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal of this particular sign,
not only to just, you know, let people
[SPEAKER_01]: know, hey, it's a really good idea to
landscape your garden, your home landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: with pollinator-friendly plants and also
other aspects of it, but also like
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage them to say, hey, you can do
this and even, you know, go to the Xerces
[SPEAKER_01]: Society website and you can purchase a
neat little sign yourself that says,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I'm doing this to make my pollinator
habitat friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two main concepts on this
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were lucky that Jen asked people
around the state to upload photos that
[SPEAKER_01]: they would not mind us using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have had like 60 at least images to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like our main, I just felt
like let's celebrate the photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if we should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen, did you want to add something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of educators had noted over
the last couple of years talking to
[SPEAKER_05]: educators around the state that using
finding photographs that we have
[SPEAKER_05]: permission to use has been hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we put more stuff on the web,
it's more like publishing and then
[SPEAKER_05]: suddenly we get into issues with do we
have permission to use the photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So building this photo library was a nice
kind of corollary, you know, thing to this
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's something that we've needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you ever devote the time to it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the need and having some grant
funding towards it is one of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, one of the things that helps you
do it incrementally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yay, we've got pollinator photos.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, next, what do we, you know,
what do we need to collect?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great tip to grow our photo library that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, what was nice about that is that
they, every single photographer,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably thanks to your direction,
put their name as the file name so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was easy to credit everybody without
saying, hey, I want to use this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be on the Rebekah image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me who it was so we can
credit that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the photos are properly credited to
the photographers, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that photo library will also be stored
on the CCE Shared Resource Library that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're, that we've been piloting now for a
while so people can use them as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I close this one and open a
different one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, unless anyone has any questions
about this one in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, let me open the chat pod.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Joellen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious why when you're listing
the reasons the pollinators are in decline
[SPEAKER_03]: that you didn't include climate change.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's, yes, it was in there at some
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what the discussion was,
was habitat loss part of the climate
[SPEAKER_05]: change discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was, that was in there
originally as a, as a point.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then somebody made the point that,
that the habitat loss, well, there's also,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's human, human, that,
that was the issue with the climate,
[SPEAKER_05]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, would you agree on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, it's not like,
it can't be emphasized by saying like
[SPEAKER_01]: habitat loss partly, you know,
in part due to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we wanted not emphasize,
you know, we didn't purposely try not to
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasize that climate change is a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was more like we just wanted to
be like direct about like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is the habitat loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also trying to be succinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a lot of text and you
don't want to dumb it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also want it to be unassigned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really careful to make sure
you don't, you put digestible amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: text that people are willing to read.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do people feel strongly that it belongs in
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we want to be changing a lot,
but I, it came up a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that was kind of how we,
how, how it, how comments winnowed it back
[SPEAKER_05]: down to this because we did try to keep it
brief.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing is, is you might
notice that underneath the list of what
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators need, there's a QR code that
that QR code leads to a website that Jen
[SPEAKER_01]: created that gives, cause there was like a
whole like checklist of specific things
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jen made this really great webpage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's mentioned there or if
it could be expanded on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we couldn't get it all in the
signs and we, and then it becomes an
[SPEAKER_05]: additional resource for educators,
A, that it's a colonable webpage that you
[SPEAKER_05]: could ask your web master and your
association to clone that webpage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you would be able to add stuff in
there that, you know, means something to
[SPEAKER_05]: your county versus having to create the
webpage from scratch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, we could, you know, it is,
it is in there, but it could be brought up
[SPEAKER_05]: more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think there's enough people
think that this is something to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other beautiful thing about this is
that this is PDF and everybody has PDF
[SPEAKER_05]: editors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can edit the QR code.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's something really important
in your garden that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: highlight, there might be something that
you could, you know, there are places that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can put things that make it unique to
your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could look at that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so Joel, and I don't know if that
answers your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can definitely see that it's a space
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consider habitat loss to be
directly tied to climate change,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is one of the reasons that I thought
it should be in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But especially if you're referring to it
in other places, I think it's fine as it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if we really do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The process of you start with a lot of
words and then you come down to fewer and
[SPEAKER_05]: fewer words.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, you do in order to
make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Short enough that people will read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely lose some ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wonder if it could just be like,
right on that last line in the
[SPEAKER_01]: introductory paragraph, it says,
you know, many of these pollinators are in
[SPEAKER_01]: decline, especially bees and butterflies
due to habitat loss and proper pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: use, comma disease and climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might all fit nicely on that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet it would.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it would fit, I would really like to
see it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I mean, I'm coming from a person
who's, you know, like, really trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: elevate our climate change interpretation
here that I just want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like, it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, it's a change we can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to really expand on that
in the sign anywhere, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just this just gives you the why behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's very appropriate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm sharing my screen, I don't
think I can actually add a comment,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you look on any of these box
things, you can add comments as you use
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, hey, great, I downloaded it or this
or that, but you can enter comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can add in climate change in there and
that will be a note for us too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if I learn how to spell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then I'll close this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then do you want to look at another
one in particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, whatever you feel is the order that
makes sense in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't any particular order of these
signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to highlight that the
pollinator paradise was kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know, you had a small garden where
you only had room for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I felt like we just wanted to have
a sign that kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, if you were only to choose one,
to me, that would be the one that would
[SPEAKER_01]: make the most sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this, I'll pick the pesticides
one, because we just talked about
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially adding information to,
and this one has a spot for adding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whoops, I'll see if I can get that
little thing on the bottom to go away,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it may not go away while you're
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a sign, right, Sarah,
that you had some room for additions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the all seasons one where
people could put their own QR code to
[SPEAKER_01]: create their own plant list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, on this one, you can write in on
the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen wanted a place where people could
could write a comment or people could
[SPEAKER_01]: leave comments, but, you know,
there might be a new tip on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not having to use like the latest IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practices that you might want to say,
hey, check out this article or you could
[SPEAKER_01]: even laminate an article and post it like
the double sided tape or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was thinking, like, gel markers,
like, if these are created, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: laminated, that's very easy because you
can just use gel markers right on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: that black space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get them fabricated,
say, at FedEx office or staples,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just there's usually a finish
they put on it and the gel markers that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: With writing it on there and when it,
you know, when it dries, the rain doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really affect it, but it does take like a
simple green or just like a cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent just to get it off there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be a space where,
you know, I think that this is a hot topic
[SPEAKER_05]: often and there might be something in the
news or there might be a change in
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticide labeling or whatever it happens
to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even an upcoming program that you want
to highlight is the spot where people
[SPEAKER_05]: could keep the space alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a way to change things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you don't want to change it,
you could pop something in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, they're PDFs and all of us have
Acrobat, an editor, a PDF editor that
[SPEAKER_05]: allows you to go in there and edit things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be changed a little to make it,
you know, work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did write up, you know, places you
could get them made, how you can mount
[SPEAKER_01]: them, just the, you know, the logistics of
what the cost range is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go through that after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay if we go through that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to make sure we leave
enough time for Holly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe maybe actually we'll go through
that now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you the signs quickly just so
you see them and how glorious they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you did an awesome job on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the photograph.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you go.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say the main idea behind
this one is to further build on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what pollinators need is to
really get into the fact that having
[SPEAKER_01]: something in flower throughout the growing
season is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gets really into specific to
emphasize the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain insects really have specialized
with certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the far the right hand kind of shows
how there's specific relationships between
[SPEAKER_01]: like I should know all these by heart
considering that I wrote type this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see the different butterflies
and then what they specialize on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also want to say that it's you
don't need just native plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: specialists that you can also have lots of
non natives if they're in flower that
[SPEAKER_01]: really appeal to generalists too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the sign in which there's a
QR code that says scan here to view a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant list on our Web site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says type your Web site here
dot org behind this one is that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a plant list, you'd like to post on
your Web site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your opportunity to create that
page and then generate a QR code and place
[SPEAKER_01]: it in over the QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have here the QR code that's here
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the QR code for the Web site above that
talks about plants in different regions
[SPEAKER_01]: that are good, good to plant like a whole
variety of pollinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't feel like or don't want to
make your own unique plant list,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could just take that text away
completely using the Adobe editor and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep that QR code that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the one little tricky part
that I felt people might have questions
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the manual, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who aren't on this phone
call, that would that's explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I talked too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and then this is the one we didn't
look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are essential.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus of this one is just on be
specifically to explain how they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: great decline and how there's a difference
between honey, just kind of dispelling the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that a lot of people sometimes
get confused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honey bees versus the fact that there's
still thousands of native bees in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, but honey bees have great
function here as well, though they're
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets more into just why they're
essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you talked about the honey bees
versus native bees and then also generally
[SPEAKER_01]: felt it would be a good idea to,
a lot of you guys have said that really
[SPEAKER_01]: dispelling the fear that bees can sting
you and that you wouldn't want to welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: bees into your habitat, but letting people
know that it's mostly social bees that are
[SPEAKER_01]: likely protecting their colony and that
would provoke them to be more apt to sting
[SPEAKER_01]: versus solitary bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to say, hey, regardless of the
fact that they have a tendency to sting,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we wanted to indicate a
whole sign just to bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wrote just a two-pager that just says
everything we just discussed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, while we're here, there are going to
be a whole bunch of supporting resources
[SPEAKER_05]: for educators also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So handouts, articles that you could just
use on your local newspaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody shared with us an announcement
for a pollinator program and how they did
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we shared that as well as a template
for someone to borrow from and just try
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself to do a program like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure that I have it here,
but the guide, it's not in here yet,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the guide does go through what you
would do in terms of how to print it,
[SPEAKER_05]: right, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_05]: How to print it, what size to print it on,
who to get it from, how to mount it,
[SPEAKER_05]: what you need to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of guide to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jen, this is Lori.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things you were asking about is
if you could get some feedback on how
[SPEAKER_04]: people are using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if in this guide, you put a link
to a Qualtrics survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then if an educator uses the material,
they could fill out how it's being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would be optional, but I think
people will be very thankful that you did
[SPEAKER_04]: all this work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might provide you a little feedback on
how they're using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I would ask why not, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had like a signing in a
visitor's log idea on there, but maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be just more instant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that could be your visitor's log.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it could be like if you fill out
this form, you'll be notified of emerging
[SPEAKER_04]: changes in content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe other people have ideas about
what would motivate people to just give
[SPEAKER_04]: you a little bit of information about how
they're using it or have used it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have to say the nice thing about
getting a lot of photographs from people
[SPEAKER_05]: is that they want to see if their
photographs got used, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're checking it out to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that brings another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we get people to know that the
resources are there and that they can use
[SPEAKER_05]: them?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other thing is getting the word
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what that maybe I put it
out on the HortList serve and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, come get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other question I have is,
do you have an evaluation tool?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of to evaluate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people who are visiting sign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the garden, you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of our hopes to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we how do you get people to
evaluate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah, maybe you have a better idea when
people come to a garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you get feedback from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's always the ongoing struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually right now testing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, essentially, the best way to
do it is, you know, if we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have you look back at what your
learning objectives are for each panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you ask questions to evaluate
whether what, you know, ask questions to
[SPEAKER_01]: the visitors to indicate whether those
learning objectives were met or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so one thing you and I could do,
Jen, is sit down and say, for each panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, okay, you know, here are the learning
objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt were important on this panel and
then create some generate some questions
[SPEAKER_01]: that if, you know, an educator has time to
ask a handful of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, would you mind taking five minutes to
answer a few questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: That that is kind of a standard way to
evaluate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can have them fill out a little
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I often feel like it's often
more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The visitor might more likely to tell you
the right the information you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for is if if you just.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spoke it because sometimes people are
like, sure, I'll write this to fill out
[SPEAKER_01]: the survey and then they never do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be an educator would have to be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a person who's an interview person,
like a person.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that, like, I worked,
helped the, it's like a children's garden
[SPEAKER_01]: with some interpretive panels and we had a
little QR code in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, hey, tell us you were here and
tell us what you liked about your visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one way that they're hoping
they're going to get feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: The panels aren't up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know if people have actually
done it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always just say, if you really want to
get the information, you have to do in the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest way possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like dedicate two hours for an
educator to go out there and ask ten
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know, a dozen people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's probably easier to do on a
garden day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you are having garden days and
you've got folks out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're doing programs hands on to
have, to have a volunteer assigned to just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of wandering and asking, hey,
would you mind answering a few questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Volunteers are the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what I'm thinking that I'm
going to do for a project that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: currently working on here is have a
volunteer hang out in our welcome center
[SPEAKER_01]: for a few hours each Saturday and ask
people about the exhibits that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we do need that feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put it out there and we hope that
people are going to come visit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we see people wander through or
we know that they're down there,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we don't really know what they think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Holly wrote some things in the chat
window about getting people to,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do we get it out?
[SPEAKER_05]: She suggested maybe doing a webinar and,
or even just recording a webinar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could be, you know, or even a
recorded PowerPoint that they could use at
[SPEAKER_05]: regular master gardener business meetings
to let different associations know that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's there and that the volunteers might
be interested then in taking that next
[SPEAKER_05]: step and getting them printed out and
installing them in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause often we are really, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PowerPoint might be good for like the
first garden who puts them out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of show, take pictures of each step,
meaning like here's the, here's the
[SPEAKER_01]: material we printed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how we installed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can even be like a little YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that like shows the process.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is another great project.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even that for a volunteer to put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause maybe I'm saying, maybe that sounds
so wishy washy, but I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I want to use the pollinator
paradise sign and put it in our pollinator
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're lucky that we have a crew,
a construction crew, so I can make a
[SPEAKER_01]: request for them to put it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can say, Hey, can you tell me
when you're going to make the sign base,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go videotape them doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just kind of splice together a
little fun instructional, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: narrative to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't be probably till the spring,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, it's on the wish.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be on the wish list for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took a, we took a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, and I hope that that gives people some
idea of what, what's out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we're expanding our education
in the, our display gardens here in Oneida
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the gardeners part of our
perennial garden, a lot of people around
[SPEAKER_02]: our area and probably throughout the state
are concerned about deer browsing in their
[SPEAKER_02]: perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the sign that we have in front
of this garden that is made up of deer
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see, she said, visit Cornell
Cooperative Extension website,
[SPEAKER_02]: fact sheet on the deer resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the garden and our little
plaque with that same picture is right
[SPEAKER_02]: there in the center of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also wrote a news article for the
local newspaper about it too, to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: more people out to see the gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the butterfly house, their goal was to
provide visitors a place where they can
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about life cycle of monarch
butterflies, the types of milkweed plants
[SPEAKER_02]: needed by caterpillars and the nectar
producing plant needed to sustain the life
[SPEAKER_02]: of a butterfly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Objectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: They post a large graphic display of the
life cycle of the monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant two types of milkweed, common and
swamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And explain with signage the importance of
preserving milkweed and what type of
[SPEAKER_02]: monarchs use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant and label a variety of nectar
producing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide a mud puddle for butterflies to
use and display recipe for mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Display fun facts about monarch
butterflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that in my several next
slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a brochure that explains how to
grow butterfly garden at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: As visitors exit the butterfly house,
ask them to fill out a survey about their
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and knowledge gained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see our little survey box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll go into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did have the spine soldier bug
attack our larva of our monarch
[SPEAKER_02]: caterpillars this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of was devastation to our
monarch display this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the signs they created that go
throughout the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's the life cycle display.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're looking for a big laminated
poster from an educational site that would
[SPEAKER_02]: have the monarch life cycle a little
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were pictures that we took.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the gardeners made over the
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some butterfly mud pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recipe right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then take a survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is as they exit the butterfly house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the information box there
that we had brochures in about making a
[SPEAKER_02]: butterfly garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like what plants the butterflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the surveys are in the info box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just leave them right there with
the pencils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's another sign right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was our we educated the public
because many were coming to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: butterflies and what happened to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had those right on our door post
and explanation of what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when some kids came I was out there
talking to them and they seemed to like
[SPEAKER_02]: the explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They learned more something that there's
predators to the butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what they we also had some
other culprits in there, chipmunks and
[SPEAKER_02]: some mice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our pollination garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like how you did the signage for
pollination paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will tie in nicely to the area in our
gardens next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All American selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: We participate in that organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year we sign up to receive seeds
which a local high school FFA group starts
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their annuals and also vegetable
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year their theme was pollinator
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we participated in their landscape
design contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how we incorporate the
pollinator education into this annual
[SPEAKER_02]: brick garden here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to submit that we have the
plants all labeled and they do provide
[SPEAKER_02]: some labels for their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a gentleman who was a friend of
one of the gardeners who made up some
[SPEAKER_02]: recyclable water sources that the
pollinators could use that were creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little sponges in there to soak up a
nectar solution that they made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the gardeners' grandsons was a
member of a cub scout or boy scout group
[SPEAKER_02]: and he made a mason bee house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was all put in the garden and
labeled there for people to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another shot of the nectar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is pollination?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the overall, we ended up creating
a mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have beetles, butterflies,
hummingbirds, and birds on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tells a little more about the
different pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of moves around with the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all American selections like how we
worked with the different community
[SPEAKER_02]: groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: We involved 4-H-er and A.R.
[SPEAKER_02]: C.
[SPEAKER_02]: school of work kids helped in the gardens
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we received honorable mention this
year for what they did with the education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how we this year have
added a little more education to our
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Sarah, for getting us
rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Holly, this is Jen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is really cool that you worked
movement into there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That moves.
[SPEAKER_05]: People see things that move and it tracks
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I saw that Fiona had a question
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is probably something we
all would benefit from knowing is when you
[SPEAKER_05]: create interpretive signage, how many,
like how would you know what's enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many words should be on a sign or are
there any other pointers?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you saw that in the chat
window.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Sarah, if you have any rules
of thumb that you could share.
[SPEAKER_01]: WebEx undo itself or a fun presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the quick and dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot I could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I certainly don't want to take up
everyone's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are definitely like there's
definitely interpretive research about
[SPEAKER_01]: like how many chunks of words should be
together before people start getting tired
[SPEAKER_01]: of reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never exceed seventy five words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to even do a lot less if
possible in one chunk of words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people recommend, you know,
don't exceed one hundred and fifty words
[SPEAKER_01]: per sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I try not to do that too much,
but I also feel like the key thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: interpretive signs that I feel is most
effective is giving a title that gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: the the main idea of the whole sign,
an introduction or an introductory
[SPEAKER_01]: paragraph underneath that that,
again, summarizes what the sign talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the chunks of text that are kind
of secondary to that reinforce that main
[SPEAKER_01]: idea with clear headings that tell you
what you're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way people there's a hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People could walk by a sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could read the title, maybe the
introductory paragraph, and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the main idea you want to put forth
and everything else reinforces and gives
[SPEAKER_01]: even more detail to that main idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's the key way to structure an
interpretive sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, try I assume people aren't
going to read everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always assume that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume that like, there's like,
have you guys ever heard of like the three
[SPEAKER_01]: second, three minute or thirty second and
three minute rule?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that most people are going to
look at a sign for three seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those three seconds, you're going to
get them to read the title and maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: other headings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thirty second people might read the
heading, the main title, the introductory
[SPEAKER_01]: paragraph, and the main headings to the
other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the three minute people will,
if you really stick to 150 to 200 words,
[SPEAKER_01]: might read the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I give people the opportunity to dig
deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the headings I feel are the
invitations to dig deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, honestly, when I go to a museum and
I see like a whole long paragraph,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, those people didn't want me to
read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they didn't invite me to read
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't, I don't, I'm not a
reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a good person to create
interpretive signs because I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: like to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like to read books, but like,
if I'm enjoying a garden, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to read a ton of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're moving.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I'd be happy to do like,
actually prepare kind of a presentation on
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've learned in the interpretive
realm over the, you know, the course of my
[SPEAKER_01]: career with just like the kind of tips and
basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, it's like the key is inviting
people to want to read more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't make the effort to try to
rope them in by, you know, headings that
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you what they're going to read about.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to read and then process what
they just read.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want you to tell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like five minutes or 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I could give a few examples and I
feel like the pollinator ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that, you know, we granted,
we haven't, um, evaluated them with
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but we could, um, I could use that
as a way to like, you know, what the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what drew me to design it in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing, which I think
you did with Holly and her group that was
[SPEAKER_04]: so critical is even before you get to the
signage, you go through that process of
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the messages, um, or the main
goal of this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody works through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Process of identifying their, their main
themes and their, what Holly was
[SPEAKER_04]: describing you, you took her group through
is probably critical to getting to that
[SPEAKER_04]: point of where, okay, now I can decide
what my title is going to be because I
[SPEAKER_04]: know what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm creating what the main theme
is for the, like, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollinator paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our main theme was here's the way you can
create a pollinator paradise in your,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Jen was really good about
creating catchy fun titles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Holly, I just wanted to know what the
mobile was made out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that metal?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was it made by the, um, group that it
was at the four H group?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had, um, one four H er and two
master gardener volunteers kind of helped
[SPEAKER_02]: to guide her on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so, and then we've laminated,
um, and used rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, um, like pull ties before,
but now we have like the three binder ring
[SPEAKER_02]: type things hooking to the sign and we had
to use, um, duct tape to kind of reinforce
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, um, this fall, the winds have
gotten stronger up here and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: tearing it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it was fun to make and it's
nice and light and we can use it for other
[SPEAKER_02]: things too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And congratulations, Holly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really an awesome thing,
uh, to get recognized, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and sometimes we don't do a great job of
tooting our own horns, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gardeners, they, they do a lot of hard
work and I'm glad they, um, participated
[SPEAKER_02]: in the contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything, anything else?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I feel like we should have like
a workshop, um, uh, on a regular basis for
[SPEAKER_04]: people to share what they're trying and
how they're trying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you, cause as you said,
Jen, it was better to do it as a
[SPEAKER_04]: collective and then to try to do,
do this sort of thing on our own because
[SPEAKER_04]: we all have our own, um, you know,
we just only see one way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you get all these comments and you
always filter them through your lens,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, your lens of what you need and
where you are working.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that kind of thing, but they open the
door to like, ah, you know, maybe we
[SPEAKER_05]: should try that or you get these great
ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we might steal from Holly now of
having something that moves in the garden
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so it would be fun to maybe,
maybe, maybe this is where Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: Plantations has a role.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come visit Cornell Plantations,
uh, for a summer workshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: different signs and, and, and,
other types of interpretation besides
[SPEAKER_01]: signs, like creative ways, you know,
to, I mean, signs are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they can be low cost and,
you know, they're always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have people there all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, um, we've been trying to add
mobile, uh, tools to, to give people
[SPEAKER_01]: guided tours of our gardens and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like other, like other people
sharing, like Holly did, and just like Jen
[SPEAKER_01]: and I, I did, you know, like, hearing the
other creative ideas people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing to, so people can like, build on
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just wanted to mention really
quickly because Jen had mentioned how
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult it can be to find images and the
New York State IPM program has a Flickr
[SPEAKER_03]: site and we have albums specific to
pollinators and also bees and wasps.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was looking at the bee poster,
I noticed that you had a photo caption
[SPEAKER_03]: that reminded me of a photo that I was
luckily able to collect showing a paper
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually scraping the wood off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to know that those kinds of
things are available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Joel, Joel, and that was a great
sharing and actually somebody suggested
[SPEAKER_05]: that we shared that we borrow some photos
from there, which we did and, and credited
[SPEAKER_05]: the photographer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But did you, do you all have access access
to that Flickr site or anybody with a
[SPEAKER_05]: Flickr account can see it?
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think you have to have an
account to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you just need to go to Flickr and our
garden based learning also has a Flickr
[SPEAKER_04]: site as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, well, no, it's not available
right now because we're, I think Sarah has
[SPEAKER_05]: a few more changes to tweak and now we're
going to add climate change if we can into
[SPEAKER_05]: that log.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that, that will all go up onto
the CCE resource, educators resource
[SPEAKER_05]: sharing site.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, if you would like,
I will just add you if you're not already
[SPEAKER_05]: added.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to have slides, actual slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a script that you would get in the
box in the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more of a sandbox location.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're trying to, trying to get
a little more skilled at sharing stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're developing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people aren't developing the same thing
in separate worlds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although sometimes since we're,
we are, what I'm trying to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're developing them simultaneously that
sometimes we end up with this overlap
[SPEAKER_05]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just because I put that query
out to the whole group on the list serve
[SPEAKER_05]: that I think somebody from New York state
IPM said, Hey, we have this whole file
[SPEAKER_05]: sharing site on Flickr.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like a wonderland, you know,
somebody opened up the door to Oz in the
[SPEAKER_05]: back and it was all these wonderful
photographs that I just didn't know
[SPEAKER_05]: existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just throwing it out there and
having that, that casual kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation that we have online that
helps make those connections, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
