[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for coming out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an awesome trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here since Monday, got to meet
with a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for taking the time to
chat with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A special thanks to Natasha and Matt for
hosting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it has been a wonderful trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to share some research with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my clicker works, but it doesn't need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am based in the Twin Cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the other four million residents
of the Twin Cities metro area,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't actually see farmland every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have an opportunity to see some
of the impacts of our current farming
[SPEAKER_00]: system, even in our urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a photo that was taken about
three miles from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live back over here, and I'm sure
hundreds of thousands of people go over
[SPEAKER_00]: the bridge every day that see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming through super clear,
but this is actually the confluence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi River and the Minnesota River.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can see, there is a huge amount
of sedimentation coming in from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota River, phosphorus bound to some
of those sediments, likely some dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in there as well, and entering
the Mississippi River.
[SPEAKER_00]: At which goes to the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the cropland data layer of
the landscape in Minnesota, just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the southern half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are those two rivers roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Minnesota River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starts the headwaters up in Itasca State
Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a chance to go,
it's absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the Minnesota River.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the Minnesota River
is really surrounded by corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally dominated by corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the yellow and green pixels on this
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mississippi largely flows through
natural habitat from the north down to
[SPEAKER_00]: this confluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along the Minnesota River, we see a lot
of images like this, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just no living cover on the
landscape or very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a consequence, when we get a lot of
our precipitation in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see major erosion events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, that erosion carries with
it nutrients and this super valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: topsoil causing some major environmental
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others we can't see, like greenhouse
gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of sets us up for the
justification for doing this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, our agricultural system is
dominated by these annual monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're critical, though, for
supporting humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of our global cropland is occupied by
these five species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at these species,
two of them are dominant cereal annual
[SPEAKER_00]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these in a lot of parts of the
world are farmed with annual tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive use of pesticides and
fertilizers, and other inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and largely as monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of the situation we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've created this agricultural system
that's really productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a consequence, we've lost some of
these ecosystem services that were once
[SPEAKER_00]: provided by our natural habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see some of these major challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're working toward is developing
new agricultural systems, those that are
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial and high diversity, with the
goal of maintaining, at least maintaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity, as well as providing some
ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I want to push this system and
see if we can actually exceed productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: from our current system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have our population continuing
to grow and getting richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the demand for food, fuel,
and fiber is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Matt said, I have the great pleasure
of working in the sustainable cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: systems lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to diversify and perennialize
cropping systems to improve productivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: economic viability, and then ecological
integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that largely by focusing on
perennial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of some of those that we
work on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as trying to enhance crop
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that diversity can be enhanced through
time, in terms of diversifying crop
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations, or in space via intercropping,
which I'm going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focus a lot on agronomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we develop these new systems that
farmers can actually adopt and integrate
[SPEAKER_00]: into their practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can it be profitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we measure those
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just highlighted a few of the
topics that we're going to cover in
[SPEAKER_00]: today's presentation, which is largely
around intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see a lot about kernza,
intermediate wheatgrass, and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to cover too much of the
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just touch on the water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly talk about agronomics and how
this system can actually be feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we at all interested in
intercropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already started alluding to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to increase biodiversity on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can increase plant diversity within a
field, which there's a lot of research
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows that that can lead to higher
diversity levels of other taxonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agronomic efficiencies, cover that soon,
and also hopefully provide some
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of these agronomic
efficiencies, there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research looking at how intercropping
systems can increase water use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of different mechanisms for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydraulic lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just complementarity of rooting systems,
capturing more of the water that falls
[SPEAKER_00]: with precipitation could lead to more
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intercropping can also help with pest
suppression and disease suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: physically altering the environment for
pests to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these have been synthesized
and I think in a great way presented in a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper out of Matt Ryan's lab in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out if you want to see a full
description of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other big agronomic
efficiency that we're really interested
[SPEAKER_00]: here is the ability to provide nitrogen to
our grain cropping systems through
[SPEAKER_00]: biological nitrogen fixation via legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of work done on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some rough numbers from a
few papers I was able to pull and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: citations for this afterward if you're
interested where they come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But atmospheric end to fixation by
legumes, 13 to 17% of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has been observed to be transferred to the
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 35% of the nitrogen in a grain crop
that's been intercropped has been found to
[SPEAKER_00]: come from BNF, biological nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mechanisms are kind of tricky to
track as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this nitrogen can come from the
decomposition of the above ground plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues of legume tissues that can be
decomposed and nitrogen can be made
[SPEAKER_00]: available for the cereal crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the nodules themselves
contain nitrogen that can be decomposed
[SPEAKER_00]: and made available to the grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other maybe more direct
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen transfer through mycorrhizal
fungi, through root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this is designed to better
synchronize the nitrogen supply and demand
[SPEAKER_00]: of these cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk a little bit about
how the potential might be enhanced with
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we know about the opportunity to
increase productivity and yield using
[SPEAKER_00]: intercrops?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of ways to present this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do these intercropping
experiments with different designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a replacement design and an
additive design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just take a look at an example of
how we might calculate the yield benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from an intercropping in a replacement
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we have our field of a
monoculture of a grain crop like maize
[SPEAKER_00]: yields 10 units per area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a soybean maybe that's yielding
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we do a replacement design and do
a substitution of one row for another,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: With half the amount of corn plants in
that field, half the amount of soybeans is
[SPEAKER_00]: the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our expected intercropping yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's any sort of facilitation,
any transfer of that legume intercrop to
[SPEAKER_00]: the maize that benefits the yield,
we would get this over-yielding effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one way we can measure it by
calculating this thing called a land
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're really just focused on the
outcome of the grain crop, we can focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call relative yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is quite a simple calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here we're looking at an additive
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we just have our monoculture
keeping the population the same and then
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a legume intercrop to that,
not altering our grain yield population,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply yield of the intercrop over
yield of the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see this metric used throughout
my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key here is that if the value is
over one, we get a net benefit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legume intercrop to the grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's less than one, it's a detrimental
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might refer to this as if it's above
one, there's facilitation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's below one, it's competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit more to that,
but those will be some of the terms I use
[SPEAKER_00]: to describe these outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of examples of intercropping
out there around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to show you a snapshot of a
couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's sorghum pigeon pea
intercropping systems that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested for grain or for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you might have seen before here
in New York, red clover under seeded into
[SPEAKER_00]: spring wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks are even intercropping corn and
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to manage this for forage,
but quite a much more difficult thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to manage this for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, trying to harvest
combine grain from corn out of a stand
[SPEAKER_00]: like this could be pretty tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we see these intercrops?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know that they have potential to
provide environmental benefits and boost
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity, why don't we see these a lot
on the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are a lot of different reasons
and there are some specific agronomic
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two different species might have
very different needs in terms of preparing
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed bed or establishment, the timing of
seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might require different fertility
regimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases, the pesticides are
incompatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd argue that one of the reasons is
that some of the nitrogen benefits take
[SPEAKER_00]: time and with an annual cropping system,
we don't have a whole lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually limited time for these
ecological processes to play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of a timeline
of a corn and soybean system in the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, there's only about four or five
months for all of those processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: production of the legume, death of the
legume tissue, decomposition of the legume
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, transfer to some inorganic source
that it can be taken up by end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all can take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it happen in five months in the upper
Midwest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, but it might be more effective to
give the system a little bit more time by
[SPEAKER_00]: working with perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to think about balancing
these populations of the two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, we're trying to promote that
facilitation and prevent the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be tricky to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that by working with
perennials, we have a potential to create
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping systems that achieve these
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some perennial intercropping
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have alley cropping with fruits and nut
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of intercropping that's
occurring in pastures and other forage
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until now, there really haven't been
any intercropping systems that really fit
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely within a production row crop system
and that provides human consumable grains,
[SPEAKER_00]: these cereal grains that are so important
for humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which leads me to intermediate wheatgrass
or kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheatgrass is a cool season forage grass
perennial introduced to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early 20th century as a forage
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past 40 years, folks have been
working to domesticate that and turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a grain crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeding for larger seeds, higher seed
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's proven to be rather successful in
some ways because it's tolerant to a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require vernalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trade name for the grain is
kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to refer to the plant as
intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever I refer to the grain itself,
I'll try to speak to kernza.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times people use these terms
interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I begin, I need to show you a
timeline of a typical intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheatgrass production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are typically not all the time,
but usually sown in the fall, I'd say
[SPEAKER_00]: early summer or late summer, early fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants produce some biomass,
just vegetative biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they overwinter, providing some cover
on the landscape that first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants come out of dormancy very early
in the year for the upper Midwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-March sometimes, and begin vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow vegetatively for about two
more months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stem elongation begins in about
the second week of May in our region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the seed head comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering takes place around the 4th of
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then grain is ready to harvest late
July, early August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, all the grains are
moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the straw is typically harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant continues to grow just
vegetatively for the rest of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Minnesota, that can actually be
until early November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to just give you a quick
overview of the nitrogen budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you an idea of how much plant tissue
and how much nitrogen is in those tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: in a typical intermediate wheatgrass
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these numbers are not meta-analysis
averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just ballpark figures based on
many site years of data from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we can see about 800
kilograms of grain per hectare,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 20% of the grain yields we
might see for spring wheat in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowhere near our annual yields,
but that's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 3.4% nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a field of currenza, we might have
about 30 kilograms of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The straw above ground biomass,
about four metric tons, 1.1% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 44 kilograms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots, we see a lot of variability in root
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had measurements up to nine metric
tons per hectare down to a meter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just say on average here,
another four metric tons, and then another
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 kilograms of N per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in all, we're looking at a nitrogen
need of about 100 kilograms of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare for this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have one of the first studies we did
with intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agronomic studies was a simple nitrogen
rate trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to figure out how much nitrogen should
be applied to maximize grain yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this work at many sites and years
and identified this optimum nitrogen rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of about 60 to 90 kilograms per hectare,
which is less than what I just said the
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate wheatgrass needs per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so you know, the average corn
fertilizer rate in Minnesota is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about 50% of what would
be applied to a corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of intriguing that this N
rate is less than what we just showed you
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is actually using in a
given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've noticed is that when we
apply more nitrogen fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get lower grain yields because of this
lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is prone to lodging.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons it's using that
nitrogen to build taller stems and more
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the expense of grain production,
and then those plants topple over and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a reduction in grain yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really important because we
are very interested in identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial crops to plant in these
ecological and biologically sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where nitrate leaching is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota has a big issue with nitrate
leaching to drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Minnesotans get their drinking water,
water comes out of their tap, comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing elevated levels of
nitrate in that drinking water,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly as a product of nitrogen
fertilizers leaching into the aquifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has major human health impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these annual row crops that
require nitrogen in these aquifer
[SPEAKER_00]: headlands, wellhead protection areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're applying anywhere between 140
and 160 pounds of N per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some areas of Southwest Minnesota,
it's more closer to 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of research has been done on
looking at nitrogen use efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that only about 40% of that is
recovered into the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many studies have documented the
amount of nitrogen that has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: escaped the corn systems into the aquifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at losing 25 to 50 pounds
per acre per year in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this isn't one value from a
meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a range from various
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been doing this work with
intermediate wheatgrass to understand its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to prevent nitrate leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it requires less nitrogen for
optimizing grain yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not getting as much yield per
acre, but less nitrogen is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher nitrogen use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over and over again, we're seeing a
lot less nitrate leaching through the
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater because of this extensive deep
rooting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of modeling exercises have taken
place, done various field studies
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing kernza or intermediate
wheatgrass to corn to soybeans to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing two orders of magnitude less
nitrate leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to our annual row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so where does this bring us though for
intercropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still interested in making that
system more sustainable by providing
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen to the crop via biological
nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really great to not have to
fertilize these kernza systems at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd also love to increase biodiversity
and potentially increase total biomass if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can add another legume to the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase total biomass and there's value
to that biomass that we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the challenges are, though,
balancing that competition and
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitation, establishing our legumes and
making sure that they persist,
[SPEAKER_00]: give the time required for those
ecological processes to play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit more about
whether or not this is a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you some results from
just a couple of experiments first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the earlier studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really wanted to screen what
legumes could work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested these six different legume
species with intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also had intermediate wheatgrass
monocultures, controls with no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we fertilized some plots with
either 45 or 90 kilograms of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to go through all the
different traits of these legume species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to kind of lump them together,
we tested these two very common legume
[SPEAKER_00]: forages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa and red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have differences in their root
architectures, their persistence,
[SPEAKER_00]: their yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see if any of those might
influence the competition facilitation
[SPEAKER_00]: trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested a few other not so common
legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: White clover, very low lying, outside
clover, bird's foot tree foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one we tested is actually
native to the Pollygrass Prairie in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Canada milkberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just curious, could we
potentially integrate this native
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial legume with intermediate
wheatgrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so on to the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a few of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the relative yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said anything above one is a net
facilitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more biomass being produced by the
intermediate wheatgrass in the intercrop
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to no intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this figure, we're looking at
total intermediate wheatgrass biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vegetative biomass and the grain
combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this study at three sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to show you data from one
site because it varied a lot across sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just show you even the
variability within one site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a net increase in biomass as a
response to some of these legume species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was nice to see some facilitation
occurring in that first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the red clover, which is a pretty
common forage legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw some competition occurring
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less intermediate wheatgrass biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elfalfa, we saw some net facilitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is overall biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one could imagine that in an
environment with another species and more
[SPEAKER_00]: competition in the intermediate wheatgrass
might tend to grow taller as there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe just that increase in biomass
is only coming from the vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really want is an increase in
grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show you a snapshot of what
happened in the second and third year,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standout legume here that
consistently resulted in over yielding in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the grain relative to zero N.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're really interested
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are any of these legumes really increasing
grain yield when we intercrop them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elfalfa, red clover here did really well
by the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elside clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's no real consistent
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at the other sites,
again, there's just no standout legume
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things happening,
occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got to start to tee some of
these things apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also might wonder, well,
are there actually legumes in those plots
[SPEAKER_00]: where the grain yields are better or
worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there really a relationship between the
legume and the intermediate wheatgrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to look at that is simply by
plotting legume biomass yield against the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as there's more legume biomass in a
plot, we're seeing less grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes some sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more plant you have in there,
the more competition there's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're really interested in
looking for is if there's any points in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area where we can get some legume
biomass in the plot but still have an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in grain yield relative to the
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for if there's any area
up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see some points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can start to investigate why did
those plots have over yielding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the species?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the population?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been thinking that these legumes
are going to benefit the intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheatgrass via nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's tough to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Evelyn Riley is a graduate student on
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked with Dr. Jess Guchknick,
who's at the University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a soil ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did this work tracking nitrogen
transfer using natural abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any asterisks here indicates a
situation where there was a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: different difference in nitrogen transfer
from zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, none of these are statistically
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't actually see a transfer until
the third year at this site and only with
[SPEAKER_00]: three of these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look further into this potential
leg, we can see that year one legume
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass is actually correlated with the
year three relative grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plots that had a lot of legume biomass
in the first year, it appeared that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually some competition in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that biomass later translated to
potentially being beneficial for grain
[SPEAKER_00]: yields in years two and actually year
three when we picked it up that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the nitrogen transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, there's a lot of other
mechanisms as to why the legume crops
[SPEAKER_00]: might influence grain yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of water dynamics happening
with these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just kind of getting at the tip
of the iceberg with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question we have is, can a
producer do something in the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage these populations or to alter this
interaction between the species?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried answering this question
through an OREI project that was led by
[SPEAKER_00]: initially Steve Coleman and now Leo Dice
at the Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Ryan and Tim Cruz are also hosting
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at two different legume
species, alfalfa and red clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: also comparing the results to fertilized
intermediate wheatgrass with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're really testing here is
different procedures for establishing the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've showed you so far,
we have established the intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheatgrass and the alfalfa at the same
time in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've showed you these configurations
where we have rows, sown rows of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our intermediate wheatgrass
monoculture, no fertilizer, sow it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one set of treatments,
we introduced our legume with the
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate wheatgrass within the same
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix the seed and we have our alfalfa
and our red clover established in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have another set of plots where we
sowed the intermediate wheatgrass into
[SPEAKER_00]: rows in the fall and then frost seeded our
legumes, broadcast that seed over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gave the intermediate wheatgrass a
little bit of a head start before sowing
[SPEAKER_00]: or planting our legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third configuration is this
really delayed legume seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually let the intermediate
wheatgrass go through a full life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested grain, really gave it a head
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we planted our legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, we broadcast seeded in
between those harvested rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have monocultures that we
applied manure onto at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we applied that manure in the spring,
important to know, three different rates
[SPEAKER_00]: from 56 kilograms per hectare to 224.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a list of the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look right away at the
relative grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is relative to the unfertilized
monoculture and monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can only look at the two
establishment systems, the fall sowing and
[SPEAKER_00]: frost seeding, because the summer wasn't
seeded yet in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some over yielding with that red
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of opposite of what we saw in
the first study.
[SPEAKER_00]: By year two, there's not much of a
difference in terms of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by three, we had a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here might be a good time to start
looking at the actual population of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legume in the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are not very persistent,
like red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is relative to the unfertilized
monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we could take a look at these plots
and ask, well, what's the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalency of that over yielding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could potentially compare yields of
these intercrops to fertilized
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures, which is what we do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the points go down, as you'd
expect, because the monoculture fertilized
[SPEAKER_00]: yields are a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can still see that we're getting
close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at 1x.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 112 kilograms of nitrogen per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be one way to quantify that
benefit of the intercropping of that
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same plot as before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you legume biomass correlated
with the relative grain yield to the
[SPEAKER_00]: unfertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing, as expected, a reduction in
the relative yield as you get on the high
[SPEAKER_00]: end of these legume populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking for these spots,
where we can get a balance of high grain
[SPEAKER_00]: yields and legume intercrop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the first time, I'm just going to
show you actual yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we also have to think about this
from a farmer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative yield is great and all,
but what's the actual economic viability
[SPEAKER_00]: of these systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is grain yield in kilograms,
perhaps, per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said around 800 is kind of this ballpark
figure that we see a lot of times from our
[SPEAKER_00]: trials in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our alfalfa intercrops,
our red clover intercrops, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: control and three nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year one, pretty similar yields for some
of these intercrops compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilized rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this nice classic curve of
increasing nitrogen fertilizer rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing yields exceeding those of
the intercrops in year two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see this classic, also,
decline in grain yields by the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ubiquitous in a lot of our
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, that high end plot
was a little yield crash wasn't as great,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an interesting point in its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the same figure,
but with total forage yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm calling it forage yield,
because we are thinking about using this
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the mix of the alfalfa and the
intermediate wheatgrass biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should really be thinking about
this in terms of economic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: That legume material has a higher nitrogen
content, has more crude protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: has more nutritive value, and actually has
more economic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, this is a dual use
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at harvesting the forage at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to our timeline of intermediate
wheatgrass, we can harvest the forage in
[SPEAKER_00]: late April, early May, long as we do it
before stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we take off the seed heads,
and there won't be any grain that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producers can harvest that forage or graze
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also quite a bit of value to the
straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm calling it straw, but it is higher
nutritive value than wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's greener.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant, as I mentioned,
continues to regrow only vegetatively in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another opportunity there to
either mechanically harvest or graze that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you count it, there's actually four
opportunities of revenue for a producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring graze, summer grain, straw forage,
and then a fall forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to actually quantify these,
which is what Mitch Hunter did as a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc a few years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just forage yield and quality
at the different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilization periods, so spring forage,
summer straw, fall forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a nutshell, there's not much there
in the spring, but it's excellent quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: really high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straw in the summer, there's a lot of it
there, but it's pretty meager in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's useful to actually quantify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this in a study where we
actually grazed stands of intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was managed as a monoculture with
fertilizer or with legume intercrops,
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated complete block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see this very well,
but you can see the paddocks in this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the values after a
three-year production period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our intercropping system and
then our monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intercropping, we actually had to put
down about 50 units of N in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: years because it was looking quite
nitrogen depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other system over those three years
was 450 kilograms of nitrogen were
[SPEAKER_00]: applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the total amount of biomass
removed from both systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little bit more from the legume
intercrop, as we might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually measured the amount of
nitrogen harvested because we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen content of both the
intermediate wheatgrass and the forage
[SPEAKER_00]: legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see what the soil and
available nitrogen was after the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And substantially lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really dynamic number,
but we did see significantly lower
[SPEAKER_00]: available then in the intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative yields from this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the green points is relative total
forage yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher yields with the intercrop
compared to the monoculture, but grain
[SPEAKER_00]: declined with stand age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first year, there wasn't much of
a difference between intercrop and
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the monoculture yielded more grain in
year two and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we value this addition of the
legume to the system in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: forage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the economic cost of that
reduction in grain yield by adding the
[SPEAKER_00]: legume?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a simple enterprise budget here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to walk through all the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some important assumptions are the
value of the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We valued that at $2.50 per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Value of the unit of crude protein,
$1.22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of urea was pulled from what we paid
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come down the net return,
this isn't really a net return because we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't quantify the cost of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just apples to apples here,
a little bit more of a potential return
[SPEAKER_00]: from the legume intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize that, anything that's
above the line, there's more of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below is more of in the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more fertilizer was applied to the
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had more grain in the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had more forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more protein was harvested in terms of
potential benefit for the dairy system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a slight increase in revenue potential
from the intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all needs a lot of work and much
more replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I think, a starting point for
starting to assess this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in summer, we've noticed that the
biological nitrogen fixation from those
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes might not be enough to make up for
all that nitrogen we're removing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen depletion is probably one of the
reasons why we saw that grain yield
[SPEAKER_00]: decline with stand age in the intercrop
because it just wasn't getting enough N.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the value of the increased protein
from legumes seems to be able to offset
[SPEAKER_00]: that grain decline right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's going to depend on the
price of the grain and the forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish I had a whole other seminar to
talk about the environmental impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have much time left here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going to give you a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do legume intercrops affect these
environmental issues that we're concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talk about water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure water quality by using
lysimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can sample soil water beneath the
rooting zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at how much nitrate is in
that soil water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this in monocultures without
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did this with an alfalfa
intercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of those intercrops did have 40
kilos of N applied to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the legume intercrop plus
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just show you some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first year, this is the
concentration of that nitrate in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 parts per million is sort of the magic
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA set that as the safe drinking limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can kind of think about that
number there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some elevated nitrate levels in the
soil water beneath the intercrop with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer compared to the no fertilizer
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a lot less than our fertilized
intermediate wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you some sense of what this is
relative to annual row crops, in our corn
[SPEAKER_00]: system, we often see the value between 25
and 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still substantially lower than
what we'd see in an annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we saw that decline with stand
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually by the third year,
there was less nitrate in the soil water
[SPEAKER_00]: even compared to the unfertilized
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's potential there for it to
mitigate nitrate leaching while using
[SPEAKER_00]: these intercrops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking forward, what's the future
research on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, working with Ginny Moore and others
here to figure out if we can breed legumes
[SPEAKER_00]: for intercropping, specifically in this
case, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different alfalfa
cultivars out there with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to start to understand what
traits are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at alfalfa with different
fall dormancy values, different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also combining this with different
end rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Megan's going to be summarizing some
of this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably hear from her pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
we're also looking at can we breed
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate wheatgrass to be a better
partner in an intercropping system?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the right traits of the grass to
help promote that facilitation and balance
[SPEAKER_00]: that competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with the kerns of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have different lines with different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're intercropping those with two
different species, alfalfa and red clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also varying the configuration just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing we're kind of interested in is
looking at mixtures of legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this research is actually done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be writing this up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did test different mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these mixtures were actually
handpicked from farmers in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: states based on what they're interested in
and used to working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really a farmer-informed study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to be analyzing that
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to acknowledge a whole
bunch of people who've contributed to this
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are past postdocs and graduate
students who've graduated since I joined
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab in
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current postdocs, I really want to
highlight research staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really hard experiments to do
and very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do such an amazing job at making
these things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just blows my mind every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mad props to the research staff and
then current students who are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also all the summer undergraduate interns
who sweat a lot and fight off insects
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer to collect this valuable
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge teammates at the
University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then definitely what I call perennial
crop pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are farmers who I've had the
pleasure of working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these folks have hosted odd farm
trials and meet with to inform our
[SPEAKER_00]: research goals and priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken a big risk in not just
working with us, but also trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance this perennial crop vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the funders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can take some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plenty of time for questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake, do you want to call people up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just check in the Zoom chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was a really cool talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I was curious about,
when you were talking about the three
[SPEAKER_01]: years study and you were talking about
nitrogen in your grain yields and how that
[SPEAKER_01]: corresponds to protein, did you ever
measure the protein in the grain
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically compared with the monoculture
as opposed to just total nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currenza does have higher protein levels
per unit of grain than wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the selling points of
actually of Currenza, high protein grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we analyze that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, your side of the nitrogen
fixed by the legume may not compensate
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those measure you're thinking
about biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about soil nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about soil nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: As in, what was the contribution of that
to the nitrogen that was removed?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you include soil nitrogen through that,
it affects your conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I think I didn't show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did see a depletion in the soil
nitrogen through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears that the intermediate
wheatgrass was using nitrogen that was
[SPEAKER_00]: being mineralized from organic matter
through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have this spurred some new
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually now quantifying nitrogen
mineralization rates in intercropped
[SPEAKER_00]: versus monoculture systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is sort of an unanswered question
that we're trying to get at right now by
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting some new data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hopefully that can help us
understand these outcomes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that excellent presentation
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think herns are so variable in
its responses to things like red clover
[SPEAKER_04]: and just management?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you pointed this out in your
presentation, different studies having
[SPEAKER_04]: different results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can also be found in things like
mowing or cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sites, certain practices help with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herns are so variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an open pollinated species,
for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the genetics are part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't like wheat, where you look
out of the field and it all looks
[SPEAKER_00]: homogeneous and the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have plants that are different sizes
in terms of stature and different number
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed heads per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a lot of genetic
variability out there and a lot of just
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in the phenotypes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a given field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is that not all of these studies
have been conducted with the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomics, like seeding rate,
row spacing, time of seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we compare some of those legume
intercropping studies from other
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions and things, we kind of have
to be aware of what differences there were
[SPEAKER_00]: for just a basic agronomics, baseline soil
nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of things that could
confound the treatments in these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's recently been one meta-analysis
that just came out from some collaborators
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine at the University of Minnesota
trying to count for those differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: all the studies that were conducted in
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can point you to that paper if you
want to dig into the weeds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, maybe a bigger picture question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's someone on the forefront.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you see intermium wheatgrass
going, let's say, in 25 years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you think it will go or where
would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the next five to 10 years from
now, I think growers should be thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a three-year crop that would fit
into a rotation potentially following an
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferably in a situation where they can
use the forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be an economic safety net
because the grain market is quite volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the near term, that's kind of where
I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producers who use the forage and are
comfortable marketing their grain or
[SPEAKER_00]: working to market their grain a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably going to be a premium
to organic, regenerative organic
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer term, so the plant breeders are
thinking that if we stick on the
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectory that we're at now for
increasing seed size, I think for being
[SPEAKER_00]: said 23 years, we'll have kernels that are
the same size as spring wheat in
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now as the breeding program continues,
diversity is going to decrease so that
[SPEAKER_00]: rate might not increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could hold that rate steady,
23 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see it becoming less of a niche
crop and more of a mainstream crop if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can achieve those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wondering if you have an idea of how
much of it is due to variation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: weather of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the interaction of the
weather, the age of the wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super happy you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think weather is a really important
confounding variable that's making it
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to understand how yields are
changing with stand age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some evidence that suggests that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the staggered start,
that's exactly where we're heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've initiated two experiments with a
staggered start design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this means is we start the
experiment in one year in a randomized
[SPEAKER_00]: plot design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second year, we plant the
exact same treatments again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third year, plant the exact same
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, yeah, we can tease apart stand
age from year of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just initiated this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're planting the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting our third year of a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much a nitrogen rate trial,
staggered start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're quantifying the fate of the
nitrogen more comprehensively in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hiring a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy you reminded me of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought the announcement and I'll send
it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt and others, and if that can be
distributed, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That job is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an exciting time to join the
team, because there's some data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple more years of the
project to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the trials, do you ever have any
extreme weather events?
[SPEAKER_04]: So would a drought affect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had unusually low precipitation
values for probably two or three out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the years that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data I showed you spanned from
probably 2017 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there were two or three years
where there was a statistical drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, yeah, tricky because not all
of these experiments have our staggered
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the motivations for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can the effect of that drought be
teased apart with statistics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in some cases, it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of the situations here,
we've just tried to analyze the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And measure the response variables from
comparing across treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then step two is to really dive in a
little bit more and try to see if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: tease apart these year-to-year things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking along the lines of ecosystem
services, at some point, did you ever
[SPEAKER_04]: measure soil health or organic matter
dynamics in these systems?
[SPEAKER_04]: And thinking also from the question,
maybe with carbon credits?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Becoming a thing in the next 20 years,
would that be a potential that a perennial
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon system could tap into?
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks who are going to make products
with CURDSA and sell those are really
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that we measure that data soon
because they want to market those
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental benefits, specifically those
related to soil health and carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been measuring some of those
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jess Gutnick, my collaborator at the U,
leads a lot of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those studies are really close
to being published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, one was published by Manbir
Rakhar, Egg, Ecosystems and Environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looks at enzyme activities,
microbial biomass, PLFAs, all that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in response to currens and annual
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one question on the Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I take that one quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have enough time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Sandra.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have to leave it, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to step out if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as forthcoming breeding,
work with CURDSA, which traits will be
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on as a priority?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain size, kernel size is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain yield is what we want to maximize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of important traits include
threshability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grain retains its hull right now for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have free threshing grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also want to reduce
shattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sort of a wild plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a farmer waits too long,
seed falls off, loses yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have recruitment in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that causes some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the main traits we're
focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give Jake a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
