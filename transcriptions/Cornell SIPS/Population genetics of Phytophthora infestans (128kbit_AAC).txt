[SPEAKER_09]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you all for coming, and thank
you all for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about population
genetics of pitopterifestis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitopterifestis is the causal organism of
main plight disease that is a disease that
[SPEAKER_00]: affects mainly potatoes and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow on leaves, stems, tubers in
the case of potatoes, and fruits in the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitopterifestis reproduces both sexually
and asexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sexual cycle serves, like in any other
organism, as a mode of survival and
[SPEAKER_00]: recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for pitopterifestis to be able to
reproduce sexually, it needs two different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are called term A1 and A2 mating
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the A1 and the A2 mating types
meet, and then they recombine their DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: material, they form an O-score,
which is the sexual score.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a score that serves as a
mechanism for survival because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: resist high temperatures, very low
temperatures, and it can survive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The asexual cycle, on the other hand,
accounts for population increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the asexual spore are the sporangia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sporangia can germinate directly or
indirectly by releasing soil spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can release up to 12 soil spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these soil spores is able to
cause an infection so whenever the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen is able to germinate indirectly,
epidemics are much faster because instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of having one infection site, you can have
up to 12 infection sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, pitopterifestis
reproduces mainly asexually, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why we have a population that is very
simple, composed only of a few clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clonal lineages are all asexual
descendants from a single individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And variation within them arises by
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are these clonal lineages
determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are determined utilizing a set of
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have utilized an allocyte test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We determined the mating type of the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a restriction fragment-led
polymorphism assay using a
[SPEAKER_00]: modernly-related DNA probe, RG57,
which can show differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, we're using 12
microsatellite markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have mitochondrial haplotyping and
nuclear gene sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, over the past 40
years, there have been approximately 24
[SPEAKER_00]: different clonal lineages of
pitopterifestis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any particular year, we only see a
few of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, since the late 1990s,
US-8 clonal lineage is the one that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lineage is a really good pathogen
of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow very well on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's resistant to a very useful or
effective fungicide called methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it is resistant to methanoxin,
people stopped using this fungicide in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2009, the US was again reminded of
how devastating late life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a year that, as Bill said,
I came here to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I experienced this epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why was it so bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad because tomato plants,
little seedlings, were being shipped to
[SPEAKER_00]: all retail stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lowe's, Walmart was selling tomato
plants that were infected with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And home gardeners and organic growers
were growing these infected plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: their homes or in their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they helped disperse this disease
throughout the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in June 24, we found a very hard,
a professor in the department,
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Perry, brought infected tomato
plants to our lab from one of these retail
[SPEAKER_00]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the end, by mid-August,
it was all over New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I was here during this summer,
I experienced Bill's face of panic and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing an emergency meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he invited Dr. Keith Perry and Dr. Tom
Zetter to join this meeting as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw how worried they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were saying, OK, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, tomatoes are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately, I saw this was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had done things in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I forgot about the impact,
the real impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were losing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were losing a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I decided to come back in
2011 and figure out what was this new
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I had said before, here I'm going to
show the genotypes that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received in our lab from potato and
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And prior to 2009, US8, which is this pink
color, was the dominant lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were others, but this was the
dominant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 2009, you can see that this red
lineage, which we call US22, started
[SPEAKER_00]: displacing US8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this US22 was that same genotype that
was in the tomato seedlings that were
[SPEAKER_00]: being sold everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that humans helped
disperse these diseases, and that's why we
[SPEAKER_00]: see this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in 2010 and 2011, we see that
other new genotypes arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are US23 in dark blue and US24 in
light blue, as well as this rare and
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse genotypes, which you can see in
the striped bars, which we had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I arrived in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to figure out, OK,
what is going on with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening with phytoplasm in the
US?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to put you into context,
today, the situation is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: US23 is displacing all of the other
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, US23 is the prevalent genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have 24 different lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a particular year, there's one that
predominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first research objective was to
investigate epidemiologically important
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic characteristics of the recently
emerged clonal lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were US22, 23, and 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, I wanted to know
what was the host preference of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If temperature had an effect in the
germination, if germination rates differed
[SPEAKER_00]: among lineages, and if this isolate
differed in their sensitivity to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first phenotype I studied was host
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, I inoculated tomato and
potato leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I placed them at 15 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after six days, I washed these
leaflets with three millimeters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I counted sporangia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this figure, what we're seeing here
in the y-axis are sporangia counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the x-axis, we're seeing the four
different lineages I studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included USA as a control, because we
already knew what we were going to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew USA preferred to grow on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we can see that the gray bars
are potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black are tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that USA's correlates much
better on potatoes than it does on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we learned that US22 and US22 at three
were very good pathogens of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's even more interesting is that
they were also able to grow on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And US24 was very similar to USA in that
it was able to grow better on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that good on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers that I have within parentheses
represent the number of isolates I used
[SPEAKER_00]: for genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this, I did it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that was really cool was to
see that when you separate that figure I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed at the beginning, but here I only
included isolates that came to the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: from potatoes, we can see that we see US8
and US24 like dominating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the lineages that preferred
to grow on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see that US23 is very good
pathogen of potato as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, most of the samples we receive
are from US23.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see how US8 that was very
important prior to 2009 is disappearing
[SPEAKER_00]: with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On tomato, we see that US22 was
exclusively found in 2009 on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So US8, you can see we haven't gotten a
sample of US8 since 2009 growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few isolates from US24 on
tomato, but very real in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: those that came from the potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next phenotype I wanted to study was
the effect of the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I had mentioned in the introduction,
direct germination is when the sporangia
[SPEAKER_00]: forms a germ tube and it penetrates the
leaf and causes an infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in direct germination,
the sporangia releases eight solspores and
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these is able to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the epidemics are much more aggressive
if indirect germination is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how I did this experiment is I
inoculated microscopic slides with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: agar droplets, I put the inoculum of the
sporangia, oh, I put sporangia in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I placed those sporangia at four
different temperatures, 10, 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, and 25 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 16 hours, I counted on the
microscope how many sporangia were empty,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that those had germinated
indirectly or how many sporangia had
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the continuous slides,
we see that indirect germination and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see is that at lower temperatures,
indirect germination is favored and as
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature increases, indirect
germination decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's also interesting is if
you see at 15 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 do not do that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't release as many
solspores, but U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 do release more solspores at 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature varies a little bit between
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of direct germination,
we learned it's not that common,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when it happens, it happens more at
higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in seeing how fast
are sporangia releasing solspores and if
[SPEAKER_00]: some genotypes release solspores more
quicker than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a similar experiment,
but instead of placing the isoid at four
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures, I only placed it
at a single temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was four degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had, and what I did is counted how
many sporangia were empty after 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, 90 minutes, 150, 210,
and 960 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were able to do, and we were
amazed because we didn't know that before,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 released solspores by 30 minutes,
80% of their sporangia were empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really quick at releasing
solspores, whereas the other ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still do not know what are the
implications of this, but if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine a summer that has very short
periods of cold temperature, genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates belonging to a genotype U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 are going to be favored because they're
going to be able to release a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: solspores and they're going to be able to
cause a lot of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the last phenotype I assessed
was sensitivity to methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And methanoxin is a phenyl amide,
a fungicide that is widely used against
[SPEAKER_00]: all my seeds, and it's believed to inhibit
the ribosomal RNA biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same fungicide that we knew
USAID was resistant to, so that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: people stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To assess sensitivity to methanoxin,
what we did was take isolates that had
[SPEAKER_00]: never been exposed to methanoxin,
and we then transferred them to plates
[SPEAKER_00]: with no methanoxin, which were our
controls, other plates with low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of methanoxin, and other
plates with high concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for isolates that were resistant,
basically how we assessed it is that when,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our controls, there were plates that
had no methanoxin when growth was 80 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the plates, then we measured the
diameter of the three different
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reported growth here relative to
growth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much less it grew here than here,
or how much more it grew here than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So USAID is resistant, and you can see
that it grows very well at low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations and at high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 is sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow, it grows very little at
low concentrations and only almost nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: at high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something people did not know
in 2009, and that's why the epidemic was
[SPEAKER_00]: so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people would have known that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 was sensitive, they could have again
used this fungicide and saved a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we investigated this in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 as well, and what I have in this figure
is in the bottom, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white bars represent growth at zero,
with no methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because these bars are relative to
those ones, the white ones you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see as 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see that USAID is
resistant, whereas these three lineages
[SPEAKER_00]: are sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that was very interesting is we
wanted to see whether resistance or
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity was maintained over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have genotypes that we
collected in 2009, genotypes we collected
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2010, and genotypes we collected in
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did again the same type of study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculated each of those at five and
100, and we can see that for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, for example, the resistance was
maintained over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22, 23, and 24, isolates that were found
in 2009 were sensitive in 2010 as well and
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that we saw for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude this first part of my work,
what we learned was that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 were very good pathogens on both
potatoes and tomatoes, whereas U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 were good pathogens of potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that all of the new lineages,
22, 23, and 24, were sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also learned that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 germinated much quicker than the others
indirectly at lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this data was used by farmers to apply
informed management decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in 2012, this blue,
this kind of gray blue that we see here is
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a lineage that we hadn't seen
since early 2000, but it appeared again in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lineage grows on tomato and
potato, and it's resistant to methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the farmers send their samples to
our lab, we genotype them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they receive, you have U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 or you have U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they call to our lab and they say,
okay, I received that I have U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I spray or should I not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could tell them, yes, spray,
because it's sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But others that call and say, I have U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11, can you spray with methanoxin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We told them, no, don't spray because it's
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are really thankful for this
data because it helped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped them make decisions that saved
them a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now going to my second research
objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm showing again the result for
methanoxin sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 is sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it grows very little at five
and at 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some growth at five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were wondering, okay, what happens
if we take a plug or a sample from the
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate growing at five and we transfer it
to zero, five, and 100 again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting to see this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, this is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: After, yeah, this is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we looked into the literature and
we saw that other people had reported
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there was some resistance after
exposure to sub-legal concentrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became very interested in this
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my second research objective was to
learn the characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin-acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more specifically, I wanted to know if
this phenomenon was unique to U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 or if it was more universal for other
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know how fast did
methanoxin-acquired resistance occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to see the gene expression
differences between initially sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates and those same isolates after
they had acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm showing U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, what we can see is here,
it's the previous exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means all isolates that are here
have never been exposed to methanoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were then transferred to zero,
five, and 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas isolates that are here had been
previously exposed to five and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred them to zero, five,
and 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, it is resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after being exposed to methanoxin,
it continues to be resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22, we see that at the beginning,
isolates that have never been exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin are sensitive to methanoxin,
but just after a single transfer to
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin containing media, they increase
their resistance immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to know whether this was
unique for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 or for other isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24, the same phenomenon occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a single transfer to methanoxin
containing media, either low or high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, resistance increased for U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the phenomenon of a higher
resistance unique to certain strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen at least in three different
sensitive, originally sensitive genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast does it occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs after a single passage through
methanoxin containing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're interested in seeing the
gene expression differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: originally sensitive isolates and those
same ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question, we used one
individual of U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, which is resistant, one individual of U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23, and two individuals of U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24, which are sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we threw the isolate in pea broth,
and we extracted RNA from it, pea broth
[SPEAKER_00]: with no methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took isolates that had already
been transferred several times to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: micrograms per milliliter of methanoxin,
so they had already acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them on pea broth with 100
micrograms per milliliter of methanoxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we extracted their RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sent everything to sequence,
and we did three biological records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from our RNA sequencing, we received
177 million reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then these were aligned to ribosomal
RNA and transfer RNA to eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination from this, and we ended up
with 5.5 to 9.5 million reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we aligned it to a draft gene of
phytophthora festens, and we were left
[SPEAKER_00]: with 4.6 to 7.8 million raw counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we normalized to account for the size
of the genes, because bigger genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have more reads than smaller
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, we studied the
differential gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were interested in knowing,
these were the sensitive isolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we were interested in knowing the
differences in gene expression between
[SPEAKER_00]: originally sensitive isolates and those
same ones after our resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we compared that, and we found 32 genes
that were significantly differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in response to those in all
originally sensitive isolates type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these genes were up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among these, there were two ATP binding
cassettes, one phospholipase, 11 conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetical proteins, some RXL-R
effectors, crinklers, and endonucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the hypothetical functions,
we know the ATP cassette family are
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters, so it's logical to find
transporters, because you can imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you expose an isolate to stress,
it wants to get rid of all these toxins
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's going inside of them,
and this TUMB-dependent receptor has also
[SPEAKER_00]: been implanted some antibiotic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw some that were
down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still do not understand very well
what these genes are, how they are
[SPEAKER_00]: implicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, much more research has to be done
to understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in conclusion, all individuals from
all sensitive clonal lineage investigated
[SPEAKER_00]: became tolerant of methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tolerance occurred upon a single
transfer to methanoxin-containing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among the 32 genes that were
differentially expressed, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: that could have contributed to functions
involving stress responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further work will be necessary to
identify the precise mechanisms underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have not observed the fire
resistance in the field, which is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that isolates that are sensitive
have been sensitive throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculated some plants, but there was a
lot of variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't really see anything in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an in vitro observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it happens because perhaps
there is a fitness cost associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the fire resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still need to investigate more to
really understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we understand a little bit more
about the prevalent lineages of my
[SPEAKER_00]: top-tier investments from 2009 to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about these rare and diverse
genotypes that happened that we saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010 and 2011?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these rare and diverse genotypes were
found mostly in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some individuals were found in
Pennsylvania and in Ontario, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see in this map with the red
lines, I'm showing counties where only the
[SPEAKER_00]: A1 mating type was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the blue lines, counties where only
the A2 mating type was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the squares, black squares,
counties where both A1 and A2 mating types
[SPEAKER_00]: were found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that when A1 and A2 mating
types are together, sexual recombination
[SPEAKER_00]: can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to look at this carefully
because it doesn't mean the fact that we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen an A2 here doesn't mean there
wasn't one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sample size was really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might have been by chance that we
didn't sample the A2 mating type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We named these genotypes GDT1 through
GDT20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genotypes that I'm showing
underline were those that were found in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest were all samples that were
sampled in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more were sampled in 2011 than in
2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that I also want to
highlight is that some genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that are in bold, were found in
multiple counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my third research objective was to
investigate the rare and diverse genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: at Phytogynfesta that were detected in a
region around central New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know if these new genotypes
arose either by mutation, migration,
[SPEAKER_00]: or recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they arose through recombination,
if there could be any of parents among the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant lineages that we were seeing in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the three possible explanations
for this scenario for seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in 40 years, we have seen 24
different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two years, we saw 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be three possible
explanations, either mutations,
[SPEAKER_00]: migrations, or recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think mutation is a possibility,
because these genotypes were diverse for
[SPEAKER_00]: their allosomes, their microsatellites,
their restriction fragment lip
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerphysin profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were polymorphic for their nuclear
genes, and they showed diverse methanoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were different in a lot of
different loci and markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not likely that this could
be explained by mutation in such a short
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mutation, we don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be migration or
recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And migration is a possibility for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that these genotypes arose
somewhere else, and they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: transported either through tumors or
tomato seedlings to New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we found them in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to test whether they came from
recombination, we did a test that is
[SPEAKER_00]: called the index of association,
that is using the microsatellite loza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this test just proves the null
hypotheses of recombination, and we failed
[SPEAKER_00]: to reject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this genotype might represent a
recombinant population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next question was if one of the
dominant clonal lineages could be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the possible parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do this, and this is how
it's done also for humans to see if a
[SPEAKER_00]: child is the child of some parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a string, and then we get a
potential progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we look at one locus at
a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if in that locus they do not have any
alleles in common, then that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: parent of that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it has one allele, at least one
allele in common, then it might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, and then you have to go to a locus
and do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I have a concrete example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is microsatellite loza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have three loza here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, the alleles, which in this case are
numbers that are distances, I mean sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, it has for the D-13 locus a 108 and a
112 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: But among all these new genotypes,
none of the alleles were either of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eliminated U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 as a possible parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing the same type of reasoning,
we eliminated U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
24.
[SPEAKER_00]: As possible parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 was not eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So further looking at other markers,
because that was done with
[SPEAKER_00]: microsatellites, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 shared the same mitochondrial haplotype
as in new genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the allosine-glucose 6-phosphate
isomerase, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 had a 122 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new types had a 100, 111,
and 122 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that if U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 is a parent, the other parent had to
contribute with the 111 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the nuclear genes,
what we found was that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 could be a parent of some, but not of
all of these new genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 for three loza was homozygous for G,
T, and G, whereas these three individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: were homozygous for a different allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 could not be the parent of these three
alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be the parent of the other 17
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We next wanted to study population
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, we included isolates that
have been prevalent in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point, but we haven't seen over
the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolates that have been prevalent in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: over these past five years, and the GDT
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do this analysis, the analysis
tells us that we have two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one group in red that comprises
most all of the GDT isolates, and one
[SPEAKER_00]: group in green that comprises most of the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: reference isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting is that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 seems more similar to the GDT than it
does to any of the other U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: reference isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because this software assumes
evolutionary models that are not valid for
[SPEAKER_00]: bydoctrine presence, then we also ran a
discriminant analysis of principle
[SPEAKER_00]: component, which does not take into
account any molecular model, any
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, both the last one and this were
done with microsatellite alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is that as the other
test, we see the GDT group with U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: reference isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one further differentiates U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 from the other isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, we found 20 rare and
diverse genotypes composed of both A1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: A2 of the same types in Northeastern USA
and Canada in 2017 and 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDT isolates seem to be a recombinant
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 could be one of the possible parents
for these genotypes, but at least other
[SPEAKER_00]: two parents must exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the GDT isolates represent a
migrant population, it's reasonable to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they arose at a single place
and then migrated to New York State either
[SPEAKER_00]: through tubers or tomato seedlings or
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was what we concluded for a
research objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I hope that at this point,
it's clear that different genotypes of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytoffin specimens, even if they look
similar, they are very different in their
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to a lot of different
phenotyping genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they differ in their sensitivity to
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different mating types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they respond differently to different
hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what farmers really want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think they care if they
have U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11, 22, 23.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to know should I spray,
should I not?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have tomatoes, should I be worried or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have two of these or just one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what they want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're currently trying to address
is if there are any genetic markers
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with phenotypic traits that
would allow us to determine the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: within one day or hours instead of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it takes us to do all of
these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that for any two
isolates, there are millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we know which of those
differences are the ones that will tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: this isolate is sensitive to the
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the ways to approach that is by
doing a genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we have sequenced six U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: reference genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 16 phenotypes, 18 GDT isolates,
36 Mexican isolates, and one European
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mexican isolates are very important
because Mexico is believed to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of origin of phytophthora festins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mexican isolates are very diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexual recombination occurs commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything you sample, it's probably
an outcome of sexual recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do a genome-wide
association study, you need isolates that
[SPEAKER_00]: are diverse and are not linked,
like the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of these genotypes,
we are phenotyping all of these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm just going to focus on the
phenoxyms sensitivity and effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and dry weight because of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show the results for the
Mexican isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are the phenoxyms
sensitivity assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the top, we have growth at five
micrograms per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low concentrations of the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the bottom, we have growth at high
concentrations of the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the Mexican isolates
are super diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you focus on this line, this is what
the control grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control grew 100% because I'm showing
this relative to the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Mexican isolates, there's some
that grow better in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: methanoxin than without methanoxin,
such as this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some that are very sensitive,
that they will grow not even at five
[SPEAKER_00]: micrograms per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this diversity is really important,
and it's what we need to do in this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effect of temperature on mycelial mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, remember I was saying that for
germination, low temperatures favor
[SPEAKER_00]: indirect germination, and that is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for mycelial growth, mycelial growth
is favored at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are interested in this phenotype
because climate is changing, and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the summers are getting hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be able to predict which
isolates are going to be selected when
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures are higher or when
temperatures are lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we transferred the
isolate to four different plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we placed them at four different
temperatures that were 10, 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, and 25 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after six days, we measured the
diameter of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I'm presenting here is
growth relative to growth at 15 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we can see that isolates
grow worse at 10 degrees Celsius than they
[SPEAKER_00]: do at 15, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really do not like cold
temperatures to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 20 and 25, we start seeing some
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some isolates grow really well at 25,
better than at 15 than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others grow almost the same at 15 than
at 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we think is very
important, but we have to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the phenotypic data,
but to sequence our isolates, we did
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is it takes the whole DNA
of the isolate, it cuts it with
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzymes that favor gene-dense
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, it will eliminate a lot of
the repetitive DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we send them to sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our results were we sent 65 isolates to
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these isolates were sent in
triplicates or duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helped us eliminate a lot of the
missing data that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received 570,000 SNPs after merging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And merging, I mean with the triplicates
to have one single genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we filter for a proportion of missing
data and minor allele frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were left with 98,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, everything that I had shown
you before was with 12 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 24, 36 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have 98,000 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's even more cool, I think,
is that after doing a neighbor joining
[SPEAKER_00]: tree using those SNPs, we saw that a lot
of the things that have been proven in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past were real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was what we were showing,
like expecting to be confident on our
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that is black here are
isolates that came from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is in blue are isolates that are
in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So US 23 is very similar to an isolate
that came from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was interesting because US 23 has
also been found in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some connection either Europe
sent it to us or we sent it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know, but there's a connection
between those isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: US 7 and US 11 are close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very nice because there are
reports that US 11 is progeny of US 7 and
[SPEAKER_00]: US 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we find that all the GDT isolates are
grouped together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's even more interesting is that
US 22 is the root of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's further data to support that US 22
could be a parent of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see US 8 and US 24 that are
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very similar at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after looking at this tree,
something that grabbed my attention was
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that all isolates that you see up
here are able to grow on potato and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the ones that grow here almost
exclusively grow on potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really interesting because
people have tried to address this issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: host preference for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no clues of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least here we have hypotheses and
we have a lot of markers that can help us
[SPEAKER_00]: understand these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the conclusions of all of my
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, what we did, we described the
epidemiologically important phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: traits for the most prevalent genotypes in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We documented that phytophthora infestus
is able to acquire assistance to myfenoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important in vitro because we
want to see this in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found evidence that suggests that
sexual reproduction might have occurred in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because right now
sexual reproduction is not dominant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it happens to become common,
we're going to have to find genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: determinants to understand phenotypic
traits of interest in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate specific recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to acknowledge
my committee members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill is the best advisor I could have ever
dreamed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad I did some of her
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet this helped me a lot with my
current research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael has also helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jim helped me a lot with the
population dynamics.
You're please all welcome to Colombia
whenever you want to come visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very close to my house and it's
like that whole year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever want to have a Christmas or
a nice winter break, please, please come
[SPEAKER_05]: visit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's really appropriate that
somebody from a very long climate should
[SPEAKER_05]: have a thesis seminar on the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions for Jim?
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it still the case that you only find
a single clonal lineage for each farm or
[SPEAKER_07]: outbreak or whatever?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever find two in the same place?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is if from a farm,
when we receive a sample from a leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we find one single genotype or more
than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we found at least two
different genotypes in a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's very preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how much we can talk
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I guess what I'm getting at is the
implications of getting a small sample
[SPEAKER_07]: from a farm and saying, yes, you can spray
or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why we really have to
pay a lot of attention to what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: currently working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a matter of time until sexual
reproduction can become dominant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two mating types are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been very lucky that
populations reproduce asexually mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, we have been able to
manage the disease easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if that's going to be the
case in 10 or 5 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuart?
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you have any information as to
whether potato cultivar or seed rot plays
[SPEAKER_04]: any role in the epidemic development or
the shift in the population that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: seen over the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is if I am aware of any
potatoes or seeds that might have
[SPEAKER_00]: implications in the population structure
of itoptera that we see year by year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to predict what assets are we're
going to see next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of explanations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, tubers that are left in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps the soil didn't get as cold,
so they survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or volunteer plants that grow next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a seed source that disperses them,
I am not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we could ask Keith and Stuart
if neither of them knows the seed source
[SPEAKER_06]: for those potato growers in Western New
York.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first, congratulations on a really
impressive body of work and an excellent
[SPEAKER_08]: seminar.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question relates to mating.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not prevalent in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's prevalent in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_08]: You say it's sort of a matter of luck,
and it's just a matter of time before we
[SPEAKER_08]: have more mating here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's luck, or do you think
there are environmental factors that
[SPEAKER_08]: affect mating?
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anybody looked at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more a matter of,
so the question was, why in Mexico do we
[SPEAKER_00]: see sexual reproduction occurring
frequently, and in the US we do not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good example is Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, at the beginning, isolates
migrated from Mexico to the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: from US to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that migration, apparently no
A2 mating types went, only A1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Europe, there was no sexual
reproduction happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was a second migration from
Mexico to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that migration, both A1s and A2s
were sent to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there were a lot of A2 mating
types, I think, it's just chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: encountering, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than environmental, I think it's
probability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they survive, and if they arrive,
and if they increase their, so places
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's 50-50 ratio, have more chance
of sexual reproduction than places where
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that one mating type is dominating
over the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take methanoxin-tolerant variants
of, let's say, US-22, and then you pass it
[SPEAKER_04]: to them on media without them,
like with methanoxin, do you get reverts?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, if we have the
isolates with acquired systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we transfer those through
methanoxin-free media, if we lose the
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that up to three passages
through methanoxin-free media,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't lose it completely,
but you lose it, but not completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are still resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried passing them through
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to do that through plants,
but there was a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes the acquired systems,
I said sometimes, grew off the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones originally sensitive sometimes
grew, sometimes didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the answer is, we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to repeat those experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because any question is, did you actually,
we all said it was seen applying that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a mutation that was occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is actually a mutation
that basically is selected for which you
[SPEAKER_02]: can put them on, there's one generation on
this, and all of a sudden you change,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it some sort of epigenetic kind of
modification of gene expression that's
[SPEAKER_02]: leading to the resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our question is, what are the acquired
systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be because of a mutation or
because of an epigenetic mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think it's an epigenetic
mechanism because it happens in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes and in different individuals
within genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's highly unlikely that we get the
same typical mutation so many times with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have no idea what it is,
and we're trying, so I was talking in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space with Richard that is the undergrad
student that worked with me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is, here, Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were really interested in doing an
acquired system to paper and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: this because now I have DNA data as well
as these genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can make much more accurate analysis
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Related question, that is, on the,
you had, was it, the strain 22 was secured
[SPEAKER_02]: and progenitor of all of these GTX where
these secret strains were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've got full genome sequence,
or basically genome by, sort of sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: by genome by data from throughout the
genome, 98,000 SNPs, can you go through
[SPEAKER_02]: and look at the segments within those
different strains that don't match that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the 22 strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you could actually say what,
because there's likely to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a neighbor joining thing takes and
crunches all the genome down into one
[SPEAKER_02]: single tree and ignores the fact that
different pieces of the genome have
[SPEAKER_02]: actually different phylogenetic
combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have time to do that yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that question is what,
if, now that I have like all the data of
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence of the whole genomes and all the
GDTs plus U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22, if I can go over it and see like what
parts of the genome are shared and which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are not, or an evolutionary model,
because the tree I have here is a distance
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, so it doesn't really take into
account mutations or models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that's something I've thought of,
but I haven't started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you wanted to speculate
on why isolates become predominant and why
[SPEAKER_03]: other isolates disappear, and presumably,
if you're asking this question,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to think of where they come from,
and in potatoes, presumably, that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: seed sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I have talked with Bill about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells me sometimes that I speculate a
little bit, but this is my speculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like, so if we go back to this
original, this figure, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: spore will disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the speculation is much greater on
tomatoes than on potatoes, and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought that being a pathogen
that is able to grow on tomato is really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I were a pathogen, I would want to
grow on tomato because they really make a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of spores, and potatoes, because of
the tissue, it dies so quickly that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen is not able to sporulate that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the good thing about being able to
grow on a potato is that you can survive
[SPEAKER_00]: on the tumor, because on the other hand,
tomatoes don't survive very well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, or not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're able to grow on tomato and
potato, then you are the best candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I remember when we were doing
this that I had already, I told Kev,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh Kev, this is your screen, I know it's
gonna be around for a while, and we see it
[SPEAKER_00]: today, and it's everywhere, and that was
something that I was just saying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: fun because I loved doing this because
there were so many spores, and I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that because sometimes you never
see anything like here, and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I told that to Kev, and that was my
reasoning, but again, I mean, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 disappeared completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably because U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22, we saw that it wasn't, it was just a
few potatoes, but it was mostly on
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, and because tomatoes do not
survive the winter, then it didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: great chances of surviving, whereas the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 somehow happened to be in the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably arrived to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, or, that's my speculation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I were to, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have you, or can you look for a snip,
a segregating thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked, and actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is Alberto who's helping me do all
of this, and he was like, he should help
[SPEAKER_00]: us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, this is a problem with vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythoptera's draft genome has a lot of,
so Pythoptera has eight to 12 chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have no idea what the order of all
of these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you see this, there's a locus that
seems to be promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Manhattan plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm looking here is scaffolds or
context of sequences, and then here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: inverse in the log, so the higher it is,
the more significant it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more markers you see that are
significant, it's because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something happening there that it's making
an association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are comparing the A1s versus
the A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we eliminate all of this and just
keep the bigger scaffolds, we see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw some papers that had
published, they were doing amplified
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments, metholomorphisms, and they had
identified some loci that were present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the A1 but not in the A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a PCR, in silico PCR,
and we saw that some of the hits are in
[SPEAKER_00]: this scaffold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, this is very beginning,
but we're trying to mark it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much, Giovanna.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a really fun seminar,
and are you sure you need several for that
question?
I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's thank Giovanna again for opening
this seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
