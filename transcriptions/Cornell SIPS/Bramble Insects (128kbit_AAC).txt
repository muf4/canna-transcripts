[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that a raspberry crown
borer has really devastated the vigor of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants and the productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, when we were doing some
insecticide efficacy studies, we had
[SPEAKER_01]: greater than five raspberry crown borer
larvae per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the plants look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biology and identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a clear wing moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's native to areas from New England to
Georgia and west to Nebraska and south to
[SPEAKER_01]: Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been reported damaging plants in
British Columbia and California and even
[SPEAKER_01]: in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the adults have these yellow
bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes them look like a yellow band.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow jacket and the young larvae are
in the cane or in the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just a typical white cecied or
clear wing moth.
Hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically in Arkansas we see mostly a
damaging blackberry, but they are reported
[SPEAKER_01]: to get on dewberry and raspberry further
north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tunneling in the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime in May and June, you start seeing
them tunneling into the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can actually see inside
there, inside that tunnel, the head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canes are girdled at the base and they
wilt, as you can see to the right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of looks like a shepherd's crook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're dead all the way to the soil
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this type of thing happens in June,
July and August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned in the previous slide,
yields do drop considerably and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will eventually die if they get enough
larval damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eggs are laid on the underside of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larva walks down the cane to just
below the soil line and then tunnels into
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of the cane where it overwinters.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a photo from Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the spring, starting in early
April in our area and probably more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: May further north, the larva tunnels in
the crowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see in the south we have an 11
month life cycle where it finishes in one
[SPEAKER_01]: full year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the north it actually takes a
full two years, as a larva, 22 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime in the fall, I think in the
further north, you start seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: pupus canes coming out in late August,
early September.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our area it comes out more like in
mid-September and you can find adults
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout most of September or October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's both a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a mating pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the day you can find females in
this posture where you can actually see
[SPEAKER_01]: them curling their abdomen under the leaf
and laying an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways of scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In July, if you're just looking for
damage, you can actually look for the
[SPEAKER_01]: dying canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in trellis plantings, a lot of times
the canes don't get to move very much with
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind and they don't break off at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't see the dying cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But later in the season you can also cut
and look for the larva in the hole,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: In September or late August, you can look
for females laying eggs or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look for eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in terms of control, we have been
working on some biological control and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've also been testing various other
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coastal control, if the population isn't
too high, you can actually find which
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are infested in July before they
pupate and remove the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been having slight success using
biological control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that we find that
sometime at bud break in spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can irrigate and soil drench the plants
with some nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best we've done so far is about
53% reduction in larval count.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was research done by my assistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Student Jackie McCurn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done both releases of nematodes,
S.
[SPEAKER_01]: feltii, H.
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriophore, and S.
[SPEAKER_01]: carpalcapsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the rate and the dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late October, this is after egg hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: May, this is really about the time when
the larvae in our area have started moving
[SPEAKER_01]: up into the cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we tried a second year in November
with applications and then the following
[SPEAKER_01]: year, we did it right at bud swell,
trying to make sure we got the larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see the results of correct
timed applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get anywhere from 80 to 100%
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guthion is now canceled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be our standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standard compound as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Brigade, which is by Finthron,
works real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only thing registered right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our growers did not like the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says use 200 gallons per acre of this
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried 50, 100, and 200 gallon rates
as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see we had fairly similar
control with all rates from 50 to 200
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now the label says 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in May, when the larvae have
already tunneled into the crown,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pretty much unexposed to
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also, it's very difficult for
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, we had very few nematodes controlling
the larvae at that time compared to an
[SPEAKER_01]: early application just when they're
starting to feed on the canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have some success with
biocontrol, but not a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now applying your soil drench,
whether it be nematodes or insecticide,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to keep a weed-free strip so the
material gets down to the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weeds cause poor coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see our tractor driver trying
to apply this material to the base of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, but he has to go through all that
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, he's applying that egg
hatch, which is in October in our area,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even as late as early November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually delay until bud break
in the spring, which is April in our area,
[SPEAKER_01]: which may be May in yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, brigade is the only thing
registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I've moved my speaker a little bit
away from my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that any better?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good, Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green June Beetle, you can see this map in
the green are all the locations where
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been reported feeding on ripening
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're outside that area,
you can ignore the next few minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's an interesting insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identification, the adults have these
almost fluorescent green wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from one to one and a half inches
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larva is a grub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's C-shaped and has a vertical roster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hairs are in two rows vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They attack ripening fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see grapes, apples, and you can
get them on blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, most of our blackberries are
almost finishing by the time the adults
[SPEAKER_01]: come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see the adults coming out in
mostly in July and August.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually nocturnal, but it ambles
along on its back in the grassy areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pupates in the soil in a soil cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some adults coming out in late
June, early July.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get hungry, go feed on fruit,
anything ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larvae feed on decomposed organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a pasture with organic
matter manure, that's where they'll be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a rearing method for our
various studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just use soil with some alfalfa meal as
a nutrient source.
[SPEAKER_01]: In May, we can actually sift the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the pupa cells, get some of the
larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a soil cell right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can sex the beetles, the adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like two cat's eyes on the female
and this more horizontal structure on the
[SPEAKER_01]: male in terms of their abdomen tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been developing a trap for mass
trapping green gene beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the box on the upper left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We catch thousands of these beetles,
so we had to increase the trap capture
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a green gene beetle lure that's
actually available from Great Lakes IPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we used 91% isopropanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that both of those give fairly
similar counts, 10,000, 14,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a week count.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one week's time, we catch that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green gene beetle control There's a number
of compounds registered for green gene
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles, but most of them have more than a
three-day pre-harvest interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're trying to do is get them off
ripening fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a tricky deal to find the
right compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass trapping so far has not been
effective after our first year,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we think that using several traps
around a planting, we may after several
[SPEAKER_01]: years be able to mass trap the population
out of the area, so they'll be below
[SPEAKER_01]: damaging levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Japanese beetle is in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this is the distribution map,
anything in purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, anything from Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Georgia
[SPEAKER_01]: North all the way into Vermont and Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for your information, I'm located in
this hot spot right here in northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetle ID Fairly easy to
identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about half the size of a green gene
beetle, has brown wings, has these six
[SPEAKER_01]: white spots on the side of the abdomen
with this nice couple of tufts on the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: C-shaped larva and a V-Roster.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this kind of V-shaped tears right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetle is an introduced pest from
Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 species of plants that it feeds on,
and mostly it's a defoliator, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see on the crab apple in the middle,
it will feed on fruit, and it does get on
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberries, but we see more damage on
the leaves and the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, Maxi and Pfeiffer produced this
nice graph showing the number of Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles per two meters a row relative to
several varieties of raspberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the first four are very
low in terms of Japanese beetle counts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then you get autumn bliss,
fall gold, and prelude seem to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetles differ in defoliation of
those same raspberry varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see percent defoliation,
and again, fall gold, autumn bliss,
[SPEAKER_01]: and prelude seem to have the most foliar
damage, but even 5% doesn't seem to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot, but in our area, it tends to be
more the leaves around the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that could be damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scouting in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetles come out in June in our
area, July up in Michigan, and you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: they like to feed on things on the top
part of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just skeletonize the top part of the
plant, and our growers, ever since they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been here, since about 2002, we've been
having to apply weekly insecticides to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent that defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we tried using surround kale
and clay on the plants, and you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference in defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drastically reduced the defoliation
with the surround, but after every
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall, we've had to reapply it to
maintain that whitewashed look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does seem to be a good alternative
to several weekly sprays of insecticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, our last insect or organism I'll
talk about is a broad mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a new pest in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually a problem in greenhouse
plants and temperate and subtropical
[SPEAKER_01]: regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, it gets on pepper and
impatience, and causes leaf deformation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in 2007, we actually found this on
primocaine-bearing blackberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: Prime Arc 46, and I'll address the
Japanese beetle traps here in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the far right, you can see primocaine
blackberry being damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the broad mite distribution with
all the little black dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two new locations in
Arkansas and North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've found them in both locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is about Prime Arc
46, but the broad mite seems to like that
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's about a tenth of a
millimeter in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males are yellow, have longer legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females male is more white,
and you can almost see the egg inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the egg is clear with those 29 to 37
white tufts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very characteristic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: ACE pictures are infested plants compared
to the healthy plants, BDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it greatly reduces cluster
size and leaf size, and it curls the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting to learn how to manage
these, but we did use some predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We purchased and released predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Javichich has also indicated that he used
Neosilis californicus and got full to good
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our miticides, of course, that are
labeled, that you can find broad mite on
[SPEAKER_01]: the label, and some of the insecticidal
soaps and oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are many of the publications that I
mentioned during the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to acknowledge some of our funding
sources and our integrated organic
[SPEAKER_01]: program, our four minor use program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some funding from our small
fruit consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I'll try to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I can go back and answer that
question about Japanese beetle traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've used Japanese beetle traps
around a grape vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like 17 traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could only trap on one side because
there was cows that were eating our traps
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we trapped over a million Japanese
beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grower still applied three sprays
in his vineyard and was still losing
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a very high population, Japanese
beetle traps will not mass trap and remove
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to prevent having to use
insecticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other comments or questions
for Dr. Johnson?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are typing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, oops, there's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would the same cultural controls for crown
borer work with cane borer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Hannah will probably mention
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be talking about redneck cane
borer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the controls is if you have
about less than 5% to 10% of your canes
[SPEAKER_01]: galled, you can remove those during the
pruning period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it gets above 10%, you're starting
to cut into your yield by quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where we do a cutoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a question from Marvin
Pritz about the photo showing the big
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in crown borer damage and
whether that was the age of the planting
[SPEAKER_03]: or the cultivar that provided that
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cultivar in the back on that
very second slide was very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was about two years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cultivar in the front,
I think it was slide two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slide four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two-year-olds.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are about seven or eight-year-old
Navajo.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, I think it was Apache or
Arapaho.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Jeff Miller had a question about
the mode of action of the clay
[SPEAKER_03]: application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just a surface thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it basically makes the leaves white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also creates kind of a dust on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, one, the Japanese beetles
don't see the plant as a yellow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see it as a white structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of camouflaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, I think they spend more time
cleaning their mouth parts and their legs
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're on those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a disturbing, dirty
appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: on their food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be kind of like us putting sand in
our food and trying to eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very appetizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it kills any.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a question about the
application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think around us, we just spray it
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all sprayed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those things you have to
be patient with because it kind of goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spray it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a commercial grower use his air
blast sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went down the road once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, it's not quite white
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it went again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took about two or three trips to
get it to accumulate to a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: whitewashed appearance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a challenge to keep it agitated,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to have an agitator system
in your tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're doing it by backpack,
you do a lot of dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of dancing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to comment to those
people who think that the June beetle
[SPEAKER_03]: might not be an issue for New York and New
England.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly in the Hudson Valley,
we've seen these insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that probably in the lower
southern tier, they may have seen them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And perhaps certain areas of New England
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not completely out of the woods
with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to ask a question
quickly before we move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the broad mite that you're talking
about, is it the same broad mite that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse pest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you said earlier?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone else have any questions or
comments for Dr. Johnson?
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be here through the next
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we'll OK, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to our second speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn mine off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to introduce Dr. Hannah Barak.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is from North Carolina State
University and is an assistant professor
[SPEAKER_03]: and extension specialist there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually has some responsibilities
with small fruits, as well as tobacco,
[SPEAKER_03]: working to enhance pest control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pest management in both of these crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's interested in landscape scale
management issues, host preference
[SPEAKER_03]: behavior of insects, and invasive species
biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very happy to have Dr. Barak join
us to talk about more Caneberry insect
[SPEAKER_03]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to turn on your?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
Can
[SPEAKER_02]: you hear me all right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little mic icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and get started
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just one quick comment about
Japanese beetle traps and surround.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Don, I'm incredibly
impressed that you apply surround with a
[SPEAKER_00]: backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience with that has always been
the rates of the material you have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a pretty heavy duty amount of clay
that's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually worked on it in olives in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get good coverage on tree crops is
particularly challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a lot of water and a lot of clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty heavy duty process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just to comment briefly on
Japanese beetle traps, we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage growers from using them in
North Carolina because the lures are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll draw beetles in from a great
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't actually, as Don said,
trap them out of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been shown to pull beetles in from
as far away as up to a mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you're putting out a little
signal that you've got something
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and they should come check
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the way, they might find your
planting in addition to the trap itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't recommend the use of them by
growers because typically, they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: either not help with the problem or
potentially make it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to focus on another set of
caneberry pests, particularly some
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles, mites, talk a little about thrips
work that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk briefly about some potential
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura mentioned that I have an interest in
invasive species biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll come out a little bit at the
end of this talk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to acknowledge some
folks who've done the bulk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: caneberry work before I arrived in the
Southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard from Don this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don presented some work that's been
done by Doug Pfeiffer and his graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: student Laura Maxey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also have some information of theirs
in this talk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to highlight one of my
horticulture counterparts down here at NC
[SPEAKER_00]: State, Gina Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the caneberry horticulturalist as
well as a breeder, looking particularly at
[SPEAKER_00]: developing some heat tolerant raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those of you all north of us get
to grow all sorts of great raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're stuck in the Southeast with the
inability to grow raspberries in the
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer parts of the state here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to highlight a couple
internet resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura mentioned my blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feel free to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post about two to three times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to keep that fairly up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any comments that you have on
that, feel free to post them there or get
[SPEAKER_00]: in touch with me if there's something
you'd like to learn more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my personal website is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the process of developing
integrated pest management web pages as a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about my
philosophy of integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: before we jump in here, primarily because
I'll be talking about IPM in the context
[SPEAKER_00]: of this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure we're all on the
same page first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think of IPM, I think of the
three M's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's minimize, monitor,
and manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And practically what that means is we
minimize the likelihood of having a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in our planting by reducing the
things or changing the things we can to
[SPEAKER_00]: result in the least hospitable environment
for pests as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, we monitor our pest populations,
which means we track both on an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time and through time to see what
our pest populations are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also under here are some things that Don
touched on really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we need to know what insects
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those ID techniques are really
important, and that falls under
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the thing we tend to think
about first when it comes to integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's a logical outflow of
these first two, minimizing and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we decide whether or not we have a
pest problem that requires management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ways we manage pests are threefold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I have these listed kind of in
terms of hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we start off with cultural
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things we do in that
minimize category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select the right variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fertilize in the way that's appropriate
for pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We prune in ways that reduce our pest
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about how some of those tools
apply to specific Caneberry pests as we
[SPEAKER_00]: get further in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biocontrol is the second tier I like to
exploit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we do everything culturally we
can to make the least hospitable place for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, we move in and see if there's
biological control techniques that are
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for the pests that we're
trying to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are things like using
predators or, as Don mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: using nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different biological control
organisms that we can utilize in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caneberry system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then third, I like to consider
chemical control after we've considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the first two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I break down organic versus
conventional because I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, particularly people who aren't
producers, get organic kind of thrown all
[SPEAKER_00]: up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, organic producers still,
to a certain extent, may use chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just OMRI-acceptable chemical
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as we're talking about
chemicals, let me first mention I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be talking about a lot of
pesticides in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's primarily because all of you
all are from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both pest status and biology are going
to differ based on where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there are differences between people
in the Northeast and the Southeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll point out because I think that's
where most of our folks are from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, the insect pests covered
in this talk are east of the Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll point out any critters that might
differ along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Don showed in some of the maps that
he illustrated with, most of the organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to talk about are
Caneberry pests east of the Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biological and cultural control methods
can generally be generalized over lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different places using predatory mites,
using nematodes, pruning those are things
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do pretty much anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the time at which you do those might
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear that in mind when I talk about
those methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical control options, specifically
pesticides, are not generalizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Registrations for materials differ between
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may slip and mention some specific
pesticides at points in this talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but contact your local Cooperative
Extension folks for local recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: about which materials are registered and
recommended for the pests in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a timeline for the Southeast
for some of the Caneberry pests that Don
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned and that I'll be mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the months down here along the
bottom, but I also broke out the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenological timings along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are not in the
Southeast, refer to the bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit development, and harvest timings as
for when these organisms are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking a little bit about
clippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me hop ahead to the next slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking a little bit about
clippers, about cane borers, about stink
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, thrips, and two-spotted spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already had a question about cane
borers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two different cane borers in
this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that I'm going to talk about
is the raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lawnhorn beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where it gets its name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these lawn antennae, and it's
actually in the same genus as the
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry stem borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a genus that is an issue on
other small fruits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the adults for this particular insect
appear in June, the eggs hatch in July,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the larvae overwinter in the canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the eggs are laid, there's a girdling
that's about a half inch apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: about four to six inches below the growth
point on a cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will result in some pretty
distinctive tip wilting above these two
[SPEAKER_00]: girdle points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larva is then going to move down the
cane as it feeds toward the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that entire cane will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the biology studies for this
particular pest are from the North,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they suggest that there's a two-year
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don mentioned that there's a two-year life
cycle for the raspberry crown borer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: North and a one-year life cycle for it in
the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lack a lot of studies on this
particular species in the South,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it may be a similar situation that we
have a shorter life cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the larvae move down the cane
as they develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some cultural control
methods for cane borers in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for raspberry cane borer, it's
particularly important to prune below the
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going on down that cane until you no
longer see tunneling in there when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: removing them, because if you don't,
you might not be removing the insect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll continue to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cane borer that we have,
and these are some slides that Don
[SPEAKER_00]: graciously provided for me to use as well,
is the red-necked cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a metallic
wood-boring beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have those lawn antennae on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are native to Canada and New
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their antennae are much
shorter than the raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults feed and mate on the leaves,
and they lay their eggs only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: primocanes in the early summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae then girdle the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a feeding cell for the larva
right here with some frass in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scirdling produces galls in midsummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae overwinter in the pith of the
cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: These galls actually will predispose these
canes to greater degrees of winter injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you'll see some photos in the next
set of slides that actually show the canes
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of bunched out, so they become
more susceptible to damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some historic work all the way
back in the 30s that actually listed some
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars as perhaps having some
resistance to red-necked cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, these are cultivars that were
not really growing much anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: so not a lot about our currently grown
cultivars is known, but it appears that at
[SPEAKER_00]: least there's some resistance out there in
the germplasm to this particular pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no known biological control
for either of our cane-boring beetles in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cultural control method is very
similar to the cultural control method for
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry crown borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the winter, as Don mentioned,
if fewer than 5% of the canes are galled,
[SPEAKER_00]: prune off those galled canes and destroy
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that you don't just
pile up those canes on the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting and let them sit there,
because the insects will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop in them and can emerge out as
adults and re-infest the planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they need to be burned, chipped,
removed off-site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also cut off primocane stems down
to the soil surface, and that reduces that
[SPEAKER_00]: galling pretty distinctively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don has some photos from his trial that
was done in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned what that galling looks like,
and you can see how it distends the cane
[SPEAKER_00]: there and can result in some greater
potential damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logic for this trial was to avoid
galls on primocanes after the egg lane was
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning was done at several different
dates, and this photo was taken about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the three different plots that
were pruned out there, and the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: galls were then tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take-home message there is that after
that egg laying period was when the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of galls were observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk with Don a little bit more
about any additional questions you have
[SPEAKER_00]: about this particular trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that he's sticking around for the
rest of the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned, cultural control if you
have less than 5% injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's greater than that degree of
injury, and 5 to 10% is perhaps a rule of
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb that we use a bit more in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's greater injury, there's also
some pesticide options that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be used during that egg laying
time when the adults are out and about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The target insect for treatment is the
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not targeting the larvae in this
case because they're going to be feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the cane and difficult to get a
contact with an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray where the adults are,
the lower part of the canes, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the primocanes since that's where they're
going to be laying their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also, there's a label for
systemic insecticides use pre-bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of treatment would be targeting
the larvae in the cane and not the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to strawberry clipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the same genus as the bull weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you who might be more familiar
with that, it's in the same group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult is a small weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of injury that's
attributable to strawberry clippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do exactly what their name suggests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clip right below the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is, is them laying an egg at
that point and the larvae will then feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the tip of that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the threshold or the number of buds to
sample is sampling 100 clusters beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: after first bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are thresholds that were developed
in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when damage is observed,
begin insecticide treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to caution all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very, very careful with bloom
insecticide treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a link to one of the
North Carolina egg chem manual sections on
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides that have varying degrees of
bee toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the sort of thing to keep an
eye out for if you run into an issue where
[SPEAKER_00]: you expect to be treating during bloom for
whatever type of insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to avoid recommending bloom
treatments unless they're absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be interested to see what people
say in response to Laura's question down
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the chat as to whether or not
anyone's seen damage in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we primarily grow blackberries in
North Carolina, they're usually a
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary pest for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them in the fall on primocane
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're a much more serious pest
in raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some photos that
illustrate that from the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the most work has been
done on spider mites and cane berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are images of two spotted spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetranichus urticae is the scientific
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an adult female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that it's a female by her
rounded abdomen versus the male here who
[SPEAKER_00]: has a pointed abdomen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're perfectly spherical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like little perfectly
round grains of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be pretty easily observed with a
handheld hand lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10x or greater would be my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are images from the UC IPM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just www.uc or ipm.ucdavis.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll type that down in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenging things with using
the internet as your IPM tool is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be things that are
different from region to region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the IPM website at UC Davis is an
excellent resource for images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily use it as a source
for pest management because as a west of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mississippi source, it's going to have
some very different recommendations than
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites diapause in the winter and a
diaposing spider mite looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of salmon-y orange color and
these food spots will go away as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: diaposing because diapause means they're
not eating and they're not reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites can be flared by the use of
broad spectrum insecticides in cane
[SPEAKER_00]: berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we tend to see most of a
problem in the southeast is if people are
[SPEAKER_00]: using broad spectrum insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can create a spider mite problem
where there may not have been one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very good mite specific control
options that should be used instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no developed threshold or scouting
program for mites and cane berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a suggested scouting plan for those of
you that might be concerned about them
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to sample at least 10 leaflets
per acre, count the number of mites
[SPEAKER_00]: present, and treat when there are visual
leaf symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I mentioned about
raspberries being far more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites than blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is an uninfested leaf,
this is an infested leaf in raspberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I apologize for the picture quality
here, but these are plants that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially defoliated by spider mite
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned that they have been
primarily worked upon in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the two spotted spider
mite, which is shown here, they also have
[SPEAKER_00]: two other spider mites that they've
recorded from cane berries, the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mite and the McDonald's spider
mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are also out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to differ a little bit in
appearance, but their management and
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding behavior will be essentially the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about those two of those
three M's of IPM, minimizing and managing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important thing to do for spider
mites is to select the right pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: when mites are present, particularly in
blackberries because they don't appear to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as much of a concern from the
defoliation standpoint as they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So select a material that's not going to
flare spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimizing row dust can also contribute to
reducing spider mite populations because
[SPEAKER_00]: they hide out on the undersides of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust can adhere to the webbing that they
create, hence their name spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: and create these refugia that they can
hide in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dust can exacerbate problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also native and introduced
biocontrol methods that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just some of the commercially
available predatory mites, Phytocelus
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis, Nelocelus californicus,
Galandromus occidentalis, in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: many other predatory mites that are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these may also be already occur in
regions or they can be purchased and
[SPEAKER_00]: augmented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're already there, see if they're
doing the job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, use mite specific tools to
control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use miticides to treat populations
rather than using broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking at thrips in my lab in
blackberries for two years now and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going, we're getting ready to roll into a
third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we're looking at them
is because there's been grower concern
[SPEAKER_00]: about fruit injury and potential
pollination impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a potential contamination
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a box of blackberries that I
bought at the grocery store this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not going to say where they were
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was sitting driving in my car the way
home, I noticed that thrips were crawling
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to make my significant other take
a detour to the lab so I could take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of the thrips that were coming out
of these blackberries that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased at the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are a potential contamination
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The objectives of this research were to
figure out, because we essentially knew
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing about the thrips that were here,
the diversity and the seasonal biology of
[SPEAKER_00]: what was present and if they were actually
causing a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what management strategies could we
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found is that thrips are
present in both flowers and foliage in
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher numbers in the flowers,
however.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant samples peak during bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the dark orange line and
the open square line here, those are a
[SPEAKER_00]: large number of our larval thrips and our
adult thrips in samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those samples peak off the plant in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our trap captures continue to
increase even though our plant samples
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our trap captures, although pretty
decent at tracking our plant samples early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season, just keep going up because
they continue to move around but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not present on the plants in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traps that we're using are these two
commercially available traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a yellow AM trap and a blue card
trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are available from Great
Lakes IPM and Laura gave you the link
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some homemade traps that we
use because they allow us to identify to
[SPEAKER_00]: species the thrips that we're catching on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the same color as the two other
traps that we're using, but we use them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're a little nicer research
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But commercially, these are the types of
traps that would be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go back to that slide for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to illustrate that numerically,
we tend to catch more thrips in the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the results between the two years have
been a little conflicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got significantly more thrips in our
blue traps in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2009, we didn't see significant
differences except for one date between
[SPEAKER_00]: our blue traps and our yellow traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we use different colors is
because different species of thrips are
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to make sure that we were
catching what was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, our blossom samples have a
much higher density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our foliage samples have some thrips out
there, but they have a much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just illustrated by these two
figures, our blossom sample over here and
[SPEAKER_00]: our foliage sample over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different species showing up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really only one species here, which are
Eastern flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking at insecticide efficacy
for this particular group of insects as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just give you the Cliff Notes
version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reduce thrips numbers with
pesticides, but this reduction hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponded with an increase in fruit
size, an increase in droplet number,
[SPEAKER_00]: or an increase in better-shaped fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit set was not assessed in these
trials, but we did a small-scale caging
[SPEAKER_00]: trial in 2009 to see if we could force
damage from these insects and
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in Kinston, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We caged buds or flowers, either mature
buds that were going to be flowers in a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of a day or so, or open flowers
with different densities of thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: with 0, 5, 10, and 20 thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we assessed fruit set size,
shape, drooplets, white drooplets,
[SPEAKER_00]: because folks were concerned that white
drooplets may also be related to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some limitations to this trial
that I'll be completely upfront about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't look at survivorship of the
thrips, so we didn't go back and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they made it through the week that they
were caged on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used western flower thrips,
because that's what we had in the colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, there might have been some
potential effects to caging, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at those densities, we saw no
difference in the number of fruit that
[SPEAKER_00]: were set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 90% fruit set in almost all of
our cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw no difference in fruit volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, none of these are significantly
different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw no difference in the number of
drooplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our take-home message there is,
we've been doing a lot of work with
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, but we don't think, based on this
evidence and the fact that we see no
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation in our insecticide trials
between reducing thrips and having
[SPEAKER_00]: increased fruit quality, that we actually
have something that's causing damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, we're shifting our focus to
looking at them as potential virus
[SPEAKER_00]: vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thrips that are in red boxes on these
two pie charts are known vectors of
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses that can be found in blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also, as part of a greater group
that Don is involved in and that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: our attendees here, Danny Liddell,
is also involved in, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: other potential virus vectors in
caneberries, including leafhoppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies, and aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an illustration of some
of the leafhoppers that we find in our
[SPEAKER_00]: traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a leafhopper species called
Graficephala versuta.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a known pathogen vector in other
systems, especially grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to briefly touch on some of my
other interests here, to talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential caneberry pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I want to briefly mention is
the light brown apple moth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the region in California where
this particular invasive pest is currently
[SPEAKER_00]: located at and is under quarantine for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light brown apple moth is a leaf
roller, and it does pretty much the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as many other native leaf rollers
that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are photos off of Mark Bolda's blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you all the link in the notes page,
and I encourage you to take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Bolda is a farm advisor in Santa Cruz
County, California, one of the areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow a lot of their caneberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some potential damage that
light brown apple moth can cause to
[SPEAKER_00]: caneberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual feeding of the insect on the
leaves is not as much of a concern,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'll tunnel up and build these
silken cases for themselves, and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a contamination issue, and this is what
the larva looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't anticipate that light brown apple
moth is going to be a game changer in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of management for us, but it is a
quarantine pest, and that can raise issues
[SPEAKER_00]: for export and import from areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's its primary role as an issue in
terms of being an invasive pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has yet to have spread widely
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, there are active trapping
programs in the southeast, and if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you're concerned about,
definitely talk with Cooperative Extension
[SPEAKER_00]: agents in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next insect, which may potentially be
more important than light brown apple
[SPEAKER_00]: moth, is a spotted winged drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a male spotted winged drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right there how it gets its
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two spots, one on each wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a female spotted winged
drosophila, and this is a close-up of what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them interesting in terms of pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a serrated knife-like ovipositor
egg laying device that she uses to infest
[SPEAKER_00]: sound fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what makes this particular fly so
different from other drosophila species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're primarily familiar with as
being the little flies that get on our
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas if we let them get overripe in our
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys like sound fruit out in the
field, and this is a larva feeding in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's particularly troubling about them
is that they've spread rapidly since their
[SPEAKER_00]: initial detection in 2008 in some backyard
cherries in California up and down the
[SPEAKER_00]: west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now found at many locations in
California, many locations in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: some spots in Washington, and they've been
detected in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: That spread itself has been pretty rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, they don't like cold
weather that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested to see what's going
to happen after this winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I anticipate that if we have decent
overwintering populations in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we do, that that spread is just as
likely to occur again, even if the harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: winter conditions in Florida and on the
east coast have knocked down those
[SPEAKER_00]: populations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the larvae feed on sound
soft skin fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not going to be an issue
for citrus production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too thick for them to get
through, but for things like cane berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're particularly problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Boulder, again in California,
has some really nice posts on this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more details on management
tools that they're working out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an excellent resource to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very short generation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they can have lots and lots of
generations in a ripening caneberry plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females lay lots of eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned there's a high mortality at
freezing temperatures, so it's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: that this winter was a little hard on
them, particularly on those east coast
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would be encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have on here that the males are sterile
at greater than 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that to be too comforting to
folks, because folks in the southeast see
[SPEAKER_00]: that and we think, okay, well we're not
going to have to worry about them as much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's pretty much somewhere during
the summer where the insects could hide
[SPEAKER_00]: out and find temperatures that are below
86 degrees, even on really hot days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's necessarily
going to be a game-breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mentioned Mark Boulder's blog is
an excellent resource for information on
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing an early detection
monitoring network in the Mid-South,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to begin training people in
March and there's a lot more info on that
[SPEAKER_00]: on my blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I'll just talk a little bit about
stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stink bug work has been done by Doug
Pfeiffer and Laura Maxey at Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different species of
stink bugs that can be present in
[SPEAKER_00]: caneberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly in the southeast,
the fruit damage that they're causing,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, is unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no threshold or scouting
procedures for them and only broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum insecticides are registered and
therefore recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Laura's been working on is actually
looking at the feeding behavior of stink
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs and seeing what type of damage they
might actually be causing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she's observed them doing is feeding
on veins of leaves, sepals on developing
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, and then this is some of the injury
associated with stink bugs she's been
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing on fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been seeing this type of injury to
individual drooplets and this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: due to feeding by the bug between the
drooplets, not on the individual drooplets
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention that again as we flip through
to the video at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other type of damage we're
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stink bugs are a potential contamination
nuisance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, they're named stink bugs
for a reason and you can actually smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste when stink bugs release their
odorous compounds on and around
[SPEAKER_00]: caneberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a contamination concern because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the video I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is saved as a file that you can
download in the file sharing section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage all of you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it actually shows is the stylet of
this green stink bug here going between
[SPEAKER_00]: the drooplets and feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike what we thought just thinking
beforehand, before Laura did this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were assuming that the stink bugs were
probably feeding on these individual
[SPEAKER_00]: drooplets and potentially causing them to
be leaky, causing them to turn white,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing damage to them, but that hasn't
been what they've observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they've observed is actually feeding
between them that may damage the drooplets
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding that feeding puncture because
of damage to the receptacle underneath,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily individual drooplet
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll encourage you all to
download that file from the file sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: section and I'm sorry we couldn't play it
for you and I'll take any questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to move us into that file
sharing so that people can download this
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the greens by yellow rasp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, that's the file that you can
upload and I will also post both PDF of
[SPEAKER_03]: both Dr. Johnson and Dr. Barack's
presentations right now so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get them before the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hope that folks, if you've got
questions for Dr. Barack or Dr. Johnson,
[SPEAKER_03]: please, now's your chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any questions, anybody,
they're trying to soak it all in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of great information and I
also want to comment that it really is,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really interesting for me as an
extension person to watch in other areas
[SPEAKER_03]: where some of these pests, the different
pest problems because it's been alarming
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked in extension for 20 years or
so and just the change and the diseases
[SPEAKER_03]: and insects that we see that we thought we
would not see in our area, we are seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: now and this is a nice opportunity for us
to get a little heads up about what might
[SPEAKER_03]: be coming our way.
[SPEAKER_03]: No questions for Dr. Barack or Dr.
Johnson?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we've totally wowed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to thank all of you for
joining us for all these Barry webinar
[SPEAKER_03]: series.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really am indebted to my colleagues,
Kathy Heidenreich for all of the PR work
[SPEAKER_03]: she helped me with, for all of the
extension hosts, Jeff Miller, Colleen
[SPEAKER_03]: Kavanaugh, Sharon Bachman, Sue Guise for
hosting live sessions and Dr. Marvin Pritz
[SPEAKER_03]: for his guidance on this and I also want
to thank all of our speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some excellent, excellent speakers
and I'm looking forward to having those
[SPEAKER_03]: archives available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much Dr. Johnson and Dr.
Barack and please all of you registrants
[SPEAKER_03]: be looking for a survey that will be
coming in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very important for our final
analysis for the program and this will
[SPEAKER_03]: help us with future webinar series and we
want all of your comments, constructive
[SPEAKER_03]: criticism and otherwise please don't
hesitate to share that and thank you all
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will post Don's presentation right now
and again, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all have my contact info both from
my presentation and from my webpage and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to get in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
