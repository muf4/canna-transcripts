[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I wish we had started doing this
soil health roadmap back in the 1970s,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy that we're working on it
together now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I confess I feel really challenged to talk
about in five minutes the decades of work
[SPEAKER_00]: that organic farmers have done in relation
to soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been our top priority and our one
orthodox.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have healthy soils, soils that are
biologically alive and active,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have healthy crops and the people
and animals who eat those crops will be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our advice to farmers, feed the soil,
not the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as the Vermont guidelines for organic
certification state, the overarching goal
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve and maintain the long-term
fertility of soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak today on behalf of the Northeast
Organic Farmers Association of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was founded in 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: NOFA was started in the early 70s as an
interstate Northeast organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the premier statewide
organization growing a strong and healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and sustainable agriculture
movement in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide education and assistance to
local organic and sustainable farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting farms and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we advocate for policies that
support a sustainable food and farm system
[SPEAKER_00]: at both the state and federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the largest USDA accredited
certification program in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this past year, we surpassed the 1,000
farm mark, the certification in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NOFA New York in cooperation with the
other six NOFA chapters in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: states and also often in cooperation with
MACA have been engaged in a multi-year
[SPEAKER_00]: project to identify the best practices for
building soil health and increasing carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: by identifying the farmers who are doing
the outstanding work in carbon farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methods that restore carbon to the soil
and keep it there for the long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: In legal pathways to carbon neutral
agriculture, Peter Lehner and Nathan
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosenberg defined carbon farming as a
suite of climate friendly practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies designed to result in optimal
environmental, societal and climate
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we are trying to encourage
organic farmers to do more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic farmers strive for integrated
whole farm plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have to do in order to be
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create a plan with complex
interrelated goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NOFAs have identified farmers with
outstanding soil health practices by
[SPEAKER_00]: holding round tables at our winter
conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we identify these farmers,
we encourage them to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's farmer to farmer to hold workshops
and field days at their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done that in New York state by
having these soil health field round
[SPEAKER_00]: tables at the winter conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then having field days at farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this photo that you see before you is
from Four Winds Farm where we held a field
[SPEAKER_00]: day in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a no-till vegetable farm
where they also produce their own compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the workshops at our winter conferences
cover the science of soil health and also
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide range of practices that build soil
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our annual conferences have taken
themes like diversify, regenerate,
[SPEAKER_00]: healing the climate, healing ourselves
with keynoters like Dr. Lane Ingham,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred Magdahl, Eric Twinslyer, Wes Jackson,
Wendell Berry, Andre Liu, and David
[SPEAKER_00]: Montgomery and his wife Anne who were our
keynoters last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fall 2017 issue of our interstate
publication, The Natural Farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on climate change and soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's now archived on the Natural
Farmer website so you can access it
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the NOFA Massachusetts chapter has
taken the lead in providing resource
[SPEAKER_00]: materials for this initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check out their website,
nofamas.org.slashcarbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this initiative includes an on-fined
discussion group for farmers, a database
[SPEAKER_00]: of farmer practices, a white paper,
Soil Carbon Restoration and Biology Do the
[SPEAKER_00]: Job by Jack Kittredge, and a traveling
program for gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kittredge's white paper has now been
translated into 17 languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: NOFA Mass has been doing, examining the
laboratory tests for mission and measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that they're still really
inadequate and also expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead what we've been trying to do is
to develop a number of tests adapted from
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural institutions like the NRCS
and Cornell that are simple and that
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and gardeners can do themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tests for soil quality, vitality,
and carbon sequestration capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've included that the best
procedure is to run these tests annually
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same ground and note the changes
that occurred since the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the single test that seems to be the
most, the best measure is to test for
[SPEAKER_00]: water infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that the farmers who've been
doing that have also been looking at that
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, that it's a simple thing that
you can do based on the work of NRCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better water infiltration indicates more
pores, more aggregates, and that indicates
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's more soil carbon and greater
soil life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NOFA certification program also
encourages prescribed grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NOFA New York together with NOFA
Vermont have introduced 100% grass-fed
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a slide of a farm that has a
chicken tractor and they've integrated the
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock into their vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: NOFA New York has created a New York
organic action plan and you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our top legislative priority for this
plan is to create a healthy soils program
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to support research to increase
understanding of soil health and the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection between soil health and the
nutritional value of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really excited to be here and
work together on seeing which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation that would be most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the federal level, you work on the farm
bill and we would like to see increased
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for soil health research,
greater understanding of the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and climate mitigation,
technical assistance and conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to equip NRCS conservation
reserves through a better program and
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for buffers to protect organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a member of the National Organic
Coalition which advocates for increased
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for organic research through OREI
and adding soil health as a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: NOFA also supports the Senate farm bill
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two farm bill versions that are
out there and we would like to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate version which will strengthen
conservation programs instead of cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: out the conservation stewardship program
and increase payment levels for cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, resource conserving, crop rotations
and management intensive rotational
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that government and
university programs should spread
[SPEAKER_00]: information together on climate friendly
practices and that farms that do not
[SPEAKER_00]: practice basic conservation shouldn't be
eligible for a URCS funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my hand, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
