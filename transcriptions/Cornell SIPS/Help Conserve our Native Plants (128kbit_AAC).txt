[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to tell you today about our ash
seed collection workshop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started this effort actually three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were funded, got a three-year grant
from the Northeastern Area State and
[SPEAKER_02]: Private Forestry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially we were tasked with doing
five workshops in New York State each of
[SPEAKER_02]: the three years to educate people on,
you know, the fact that we're losing our
ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash species across the state and now
across much of the east.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to these workshops,
we were tasked with making 150 collections
[SPEAKER_02]: over the course of the three years of the
three most common ash species that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here on the right-hand side of the
slide, you have the Latin phraxinus is the
[SPEAKER_02]: genus for ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Americana, which is the white
ash, Pennsylvania, which is the green ash,
[SPEAKER_02]: and nigra, which is the black ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a little bit about the Nationwide
Collection Program because this program,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it extends beyond our efforts
here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it's a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest Service effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's collections happening,
you know, all over, you know, from Ohio
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the southeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Massachusetts, it's a really big,
almost nationwide effort that we're a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of, which is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the general gist of it is that we want
to collect these seeds to preserve the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic diversity of ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll explain a little bit more about
that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in essence, we're losing these species
to an invasive insect, the emerald ash
[SPEAKER_02]: borer, which I'm sure the majority of you
have heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, so these seeds will be stored
long-term up to 50 years in a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forest Service seed bank down in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so that way, researchers
and breeders will be able to look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics of these trees and see if they
can't, you know, breed a more resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: species or, you know, look a little more
about why some trees are more resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, you know, the potential
for these seeds to be used in future
[SPEAKER_02]: restoration efforts once we have the
problem of emerald ash borer under
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingers crossed that we do one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to tell you a little bit more about
emerald ash borer, as I said, I assume if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a citizen of New York State,
you have an infestation somewhere near
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the Catskills, we're unfortunately
home to the largest, one of the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: now and fastest growing infestations in
the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So emerald ash borer is a little teeny
tiny, beautiful insect, which is stiff to
[SPEAKER_02]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It arrived here in the states a long time
ago, probably in Detroit first,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it came in in packing material for car
parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, you know, came into those car
factories that Detroit was famous for and
[SPEAKER_02]: started infesting trees in Michigan and
pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for really scratching their heads
over it because trees start to show
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms of infestation before the bug is
actually visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they'll start dropping
leaves, their canopy will thin,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll just, you know, look off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this thing called epicormic
sprouting, which is when leaves actually
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of, you know, the trunk itself or
the base of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a sign of stress that their,
the tissues that they use for transporting
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and water are being compromised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was discovered in Michigan in 2002
and it came to New York in 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's in over 24 states and at
least two Canadian provinces, probably
[SPEAKER_02]: more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly fast moving and hard to
track because it will be transported in
[SPEAKER_02]: infested material like logs and ashes of
very popular, useful timber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green and black light species of ash
that's mentioned before are very
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, we're expecting nearly
100% mortality in forests, in ash forests
[SPEAKER_02]: across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that it happens really
fast if you live near one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: epicenters.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, where I live in the Catskills,
it arrived first in Woodstock around 2009,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little earlier it came and already we
have over 95% mortality in those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the ash are dead and have fallen
and, you know, it's, the game is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at functional extirpation
of this species.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge blow to not only the
ecology that these trees are a part of,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, also economically,
as I said, it's a very important timber
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to take a little look at, you know,
why this mattered so much, as I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see on the left that map is,
it's a distribution of ash by county.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like the density of ash in
each county.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see up by Ontario, there is a
ton of ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like 30% ash in those
forests there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a huge, huge blow to lose those
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very common tree species
throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have somewhere around 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: of our forests are ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there on the right is a map from last
year that looks at sort of the core areas
[SPEAKER_02]: of where these EAB infestations have
gotten started and how they're spreading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the black is like, you know,
the trees are dead and dying and the red
[SPEAKER_02]: is how it's sort of spreading out from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see more updated maps of these,
they update them, you know, maybe once or
[SPEAKER_02]: twice a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look that up on the Department of
Environmental Conservation website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a closer look at some of
the biggest and fastest moving
[SPEAKER_02]: infestations in our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of urban and suburban infestations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash is a very popular street tree because
it's, you know, super hardy and tolerant
[SPEAKER_02]: to pollution and compaction and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of these streets have
ash trees that are going to be falling on
[SPEAKER_02]: houses and cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's a pretty serious
problem across, you know, many sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: spheres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the ways that states have been
trying to deal with this problem is by
[SPEAKER_02]: setting up quarantines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular strategy was enacted last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was maybe last May or somewhere
around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's little, you know, draw stations
and they're trying to limit or regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: the infested materials that are moving in
and out of those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, as I said, it's really very hard
to see if stations are going to pop up
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's timber or firewood around all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't burn a piece of firewood or,
you know, you're transporting timber
[SPEAKER_02]: during flight season, one of these little
larvae can metamorphose and just fly out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that infested wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're driving along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we have these rules
about don't move firewood more than 50
[SPEAKER_02]: miles per flight in New York State because
this is how these forest pests get
[SPEAKER_02]: transported.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, some of the other ways to
deal with it other than quarantines are
[SPEAKER_02]: removing the trees and replacing them with
something that's in ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some natives, a lot of these ash
aren't native, but they come from sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: Midwestern stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, we like to think about
using genetically local feedstock,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, makes things kind of more
accustomed to vagaries of our particular
[SPEAKER_02]: climate and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use insecticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insecticides do work on ash trees so long
as they're not, you know, super infested.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have a beautiful specimen
tree or a great seed producer or something
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging over your house, you know,
by all means, that's a great option to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you're going to treat it for
expensive controls, native like
[SPEAKER_02]: woodpecker, non-native.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few species of wasps that are
released right now that are pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: effective parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, however they do target some of
our native ash borers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, our native ash borer is
not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our ash trees are adapted and evolved to
deal with our native ash borer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's seed collections as a
great management option.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a little more about that,
why we like seed collection so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, outside the actual habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can't stop EAB, we can take their
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bank them and ensure that those trees
have a chance of survival later on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's inexpensive, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you know, cutting down trees
and treating with insecticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed collection, very, you know,
comparably cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone can do it, which is why we are
having this webinar, because we would love
[SPEAKER_02]: for you guys to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said, this grant has been going on
for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had a huge seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ash is a massing species, like oaks,
for example, which means that they tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: have sort of a massive seed production
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is to overwhelm seed predators and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put all of your seeds into one
year, and that way you make sure that at
[SPEAKER_02]: least some of them survive seed predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we collected like crazy last fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a ton of volunteers who were
involved in scouting for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 75, 80 people who were
scouting for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had 60 folks who were actually
making collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all across New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sort of, New York State is divided
into eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: These eight, we're an ecoregion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we make sure that we're kind
of, getting a lot of diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: different trees growing in different
habitats across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are evenly dispersed across the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made 200 collections last year,
which was way above 150 collections for
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual grant that we were obligated to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had tons and tons of white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a very easy species to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good amount of green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little harder to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had not too much black.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk more about later Mr. Grove
areas where people don't go very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't get too many collections of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were thinking, you know,
wow, we've exceeded this goal so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 223 collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do this year since it's
probably not going to be another mass
[SPEAKER_02]: year?
[SPEAKER_02]: These trees have really exhausted
themselves by this huge bumper crop year
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we thought about,
you know, species that are associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the species that are going to
suffer as well once these trees that
[SPEAKER_02]: dominate the canopy die?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we preserve their species?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we preserve their genetics,
their diversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came up with a list of species that
were, as I said, were associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: these ash forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did this primarily by looking at
the New York Natural Heritage Program's
[SPEAKER_02]: data on ash forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took out any rare species,
any species that has orthodox seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that you can't preserve it for
more than a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has really high moisture or oil
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came up with 22 species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was hoping that today could go
through some of these because they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're all relatively common.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we only have an hour for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to say is, if you have
an interest in plants and you think you
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to do some collections of these
associated species, then get in touch with
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can go through some of the ones,
you know, you could pick five or ten to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of get really, really good at
identifying and then could collect those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and contribute to our seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these plants are, they produce seed
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've just started collecting some of
them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit challenging because you
have to collect from a large population,
[SPEAKER_02]: so over 50 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to improve your plant ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it's part of this really
big growing network of seed collectors
[SPEAKER_02]: working to conserve native plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we weren't going to focus on these
associated species this year, but then all
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sudden we started getting reports
that lo and behold, some ash were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: still producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since that's sort of the focus of our
grant, we're going to continue hammering
[SPEAKER_02]: on Frexanus and trying to get more
collections of ash seed, particularly the
[SPEAKER_02]: green and the black ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I am going to do then is get
through, if I can advance this slide,
[SPEAKER_02]: is go through the identification of these
three different common species of ash that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have in New York State and what are
seed collection protocol is in the hopes
[SPEAKER_02]: that some of you might be able to help us
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a white ash, Frexanus acana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say this is one of the easier,
this is the easiest ash to identify,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only because it's very common and
abundant, but because it just sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, maybe I've been looking at too much
ash, but I think it just sort of jumps out
[SPEAKER_02]: at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You often see it along roadsides and in
old fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of an upland species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It inhabits drier soils than the other two
species that we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But characteristic of the ash is it has
what we know as opposite leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the leaves actually come off of the
main stem opposite one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there aren't too many other tree
species that are going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The maples do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boxelder does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a maple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want to make sure, the first thing
that you're looking for is those opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and opposite branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a picture of a white ash there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And white ash has these sort of broader
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two things that you're looking at
there, that's an entire leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little leaves coming off are known as
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had a pointer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So white ash has these sort of more
rounded, chunkier, wider leaflets,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas green ash has more lanciolates,
thinner leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good identifying feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, white ash has pale undersides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could think white ash, white
undersides, or white ash wide leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then green ash is green, green all
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green ash also tends to have this glossy
sheen to it, I find, a little glossier
[SPEAKER_02]: than the other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here is a black ash leaf,
which, like I said, black ash is more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to find because it likes
wetlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it grows a lot in Hudson around here in
the tidal swamp area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like a white ash or green ash
where you're driving along and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, hey, there's an ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of rare that you would be able
to see a black ash that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, in these pictures here,
the whole thing that you're looking at is
[SPEAKER_02]: a leaf and those little leaves coming off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with black ash, the leaflets are
sessile, which means that they just sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of sit right on that central stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a little teeny stem coming
off that connects them to that central
[SPEAKER_02]: stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That central stem is called a rachis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying not to do too much botanical
terminology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those leaflets are just sitting right
there on the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think another good way to determine
black ash is it also has this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: flaky bark in comparison to the other two,
which have quite regular grooved,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people say diamond-shaped bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are other ways which I
don't find as helpful to determine the
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the black ash twig on the left
has a sort of fatter terminal bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people call that an ice cone terminal
bud, as opposed to the green ash,
[SPEAKER_02]: a smaller terminal bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can also look at what we call
leaf scars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you pull off a leaf from a stem,
that little sort of looks kind of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: shape of a smiling mouth where you pulled
the leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the leaf scar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of characteristics on these ash
can be variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can actually often look like
they're sort of somewhere in between two
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk a little bit about that
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with white ash, often the leaf scar
looks like this crescent moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know someone who reminds herself of
that by saying white ash, white moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remembering the shape of that leaf
scar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are another great way to
distinguish between species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would be looking at seeds and
blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get really good, you can
determine them as you're driving by at 60
[SPEAKER_02]: miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green ash are in these really tight,
sort of chunky panicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole aggregation there is called a
panicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And green ash is that picture on the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how it's just really big chunky clump
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those seeds are narrower as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more, I guess, tapered than the white
ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the white ash, the picture on the
right, are much looser, much sparser
[SPEAKER_02]: panicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking at the seeds themselves
up close, you can see the differences
[SPEAKER_02]: between the green ash and the white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green being much narrower and sort of
more elongate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the white ash with that broader base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the black ash is totally
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of almost oval shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the black ash, well, I'll get into
this later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just getting ahead of myself here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to quickly review the
identification of those species,
[SPEAKER_02]: remember, you want to straight away look
for the opposite branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ash have these, what we know as
compound leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said that whole structure was a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little things coming off of it are
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a compound leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So opposite branching, compound leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then make sure you're looking at
multiple characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look at the leaf scar or the
buds, look at the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the habitat, the location
where you're going to find the species is
[SPEAKER_02]: really helpful too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said, white ash is usually more of
an upland species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be found in an area that gets sort
of with higher water table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll see white ash will start
to call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old ash yellows will start to get a little
stressed because it likes some drier
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green ash is maybe in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil can be moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then black ash really likes wet areas,
likes wet feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a spectrum that you have
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so moving on to our collection
strategy and protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm having trouble with this
clicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so this is just kind of an overview of
what we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've identified the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to locate and monitor
some good seed trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are anywhere in your local park or
your backyard, your front yard,
[SPEAKER_02]: along the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to make sure that it's not a
planted tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good way to determine that is,
first of all, you identify that it's one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an Asian ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not planted in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you'll see an ash tree planted
out in the middle of sort of a really
[SPEAKER_02]: neatly maintained lawn in a park or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be questionable whether that's
planted or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can talk to park staff to
confirm that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't want to be collecting the
seeds and preserving the genetics of these
[SPEAKER_02]: trees that have questionable origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know where they come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be collecting the seeds that we
know are native New Yorkers because we
[SPEAKER_02]: care about our New York natives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to teach you how to check
for seed maturity because it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: to collect seed at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they're not too insect damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell you how to fill out that data sheet,
how to pick seeds, and how to handle them
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned before, our sort of general
strategy for this three-year program was
[SPEAKER_02]: to make 150 collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those collections are supposed to be
divided evenly between those three common
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 collections of green, 50 of white,
and 50 of black.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we exceed those collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got 223.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we got something like 150 white,
60 green, and then the remainder were
[SPEAKER_02]: black.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, that's sort of based upon
ease of finding since the white is so easy
[SPEAKER_02]: to observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to get these trees sort
of spread more or less evenly across these
[SPEAKER_02]: ecoregions that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the map on the right is a
sort of finer gray map of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecoregions across New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ecoregions are based on things like
climate, and soil type, and how much it
[SPEAKER_02]: rains, things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's just to make sure we're
capturing the most genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: possible in these collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our protocol generally, we're looking
for naturally occurring trees,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to make sure that your trees
are 100 to 300 feet apart, so 100 foot
[SPEAKER_02]: minimum between your trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find three trees sort of in a
cluster and they all look great,
[SPEAKER_02]: just make sure they're not super close,
because it's possible you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting from two trees that are
connected underground or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that they're
genetically as different and diverse as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make one collection per
tree, so not multiple collections on one
[SPEAKER_02]: tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's tons and tons of seed,
just all in one collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they seem to be maturing at different
times, just all at one collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to take a regular grocery
bag, just one of those paper bags,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it needs to be filled with at least
two to three inches of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a lot of seed,
but generally, if ash is producing seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll have no problem filling it that
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paper bags are kind of neat,
actually, because the first crease line is
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of a minimum fill line,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to need to fill up
the sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a twig sample,
and you're going to have to take a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of sounds like a lot, but I
promise you it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, you have to know when the seeds
are ready to collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go through a few images
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in ash seed, the whole structure is
called a samara.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to start maturing very
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some, as early as mid-September,
we found last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can really hang on the tree for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So into November, we were collecting in
early December last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you want to do is you want to
look for a brown seed coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seed is actually inside the samara.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the samara helps with dispersal with
wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these seeds can fly away from their
home tree and a good spot to root and
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seeds that drop early,
we often get a lot of questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: this, are often damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't worry about picking them up from
the ground, because those are natural
[SPEAKER_02]: abortions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be picking off of the tree
starting around mid-September.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only exception to that is that black
ash seeds don't actually mature on the
[SPEAKER_02]: tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often, they'll drop off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can collect those from the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you do these little checks,
which I'm going to show you now,
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure it's viable seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually peel off the exterior
of the samara, as is shown in these
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can look closely on the picture
on the right, it's actually revealing the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed inside that whole fruit, the samara
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it has a brown seed coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're looking for,
that pale, brown seed coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you peel it open and you see that it's
green or white or it's shriveled or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not filling the whole cavity, then the
seed is either bad or not yet mature,
[SPEAKER_02]: too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want a pale, brown seed coat,
and you want to make sure it's nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: plump and full.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are some good pictures
demonstrating that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on the left, that embryo is
immature, pale green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the right, you can see a
great-looking seed coming out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: samara, nice and full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it seems a little sloppy,
again, you're probably too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice firm with a brown,
pale, brown seed coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have the fingernails to tear
open the samara, you can also use a razor
[SPEAKER_02]: blade, but they're pretty easy to get
open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are just some more cut tests
that show you what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside that samara, so on the left there,
you can see that this is really maybe half
[SPEAKER_02]: of its actual mature size, so not ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there on the right, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some very good-looking seeds,
nice and full, with those brown seed
[SPEAKER_02]: coats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also want to look for insect
damage, because this is a major,
[SPEAKER_02]: major, thing to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weevils are a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love ash seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to collect a tree
that's highly infested with weevils,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that seed is not viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you can see that weevil image
on a cut test, but you can also just see
[SPEAKER_02]: it on the exterior.
[SPEAKER_02]: The left-hand side penetrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fruit to lay an egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you open it up inside,
this is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see there's a little larva inside
who's munching away on that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you find an ash tree that has good
fruit, go around, pick some seeds off of
[SPEAKER_02]: each side of the tree and do an
inspection.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it seems like most of the seeds are
infested, then just forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a bad tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bother collecting from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a tree where the majority of the
fruits are nice and full and not infested.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've identified the tree, found a good
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are full and mature,
not damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing is to look at the data
sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this ash seed collection data sheet,
I can either email it to you, or you can
[SPEAKER_02]: find it online at www.marsbee.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little scary, but I assure you
it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basic stuff like date of collection,
what your name is, what species you're
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting from, where you are,
what the topography is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing is to fill out
that little black box in the top
[SPEAKER_02]: right-hand corner, which asks for your
collector's ID number and your seed lot
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we're going to link you and
your seed to the actual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this data to the actual collection of
seeds that you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your collector's ID number is your last
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my last name is Marquand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the number collection that you've
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've made one collection,
it would be Marquand001.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I make my 100th collection,
it will be Marquand10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your ID number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the seed lot number, seed lot ID
is Marsbee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a way of showing that you
are linked to our project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this information also has to go on the
paper bag that contains the seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: just as I said, to make sure that
information on that data sheet is always
[SPEAKER_02]: linked to that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're part of a group,
if you as master gardeners get together
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want to do something for your
town, you can come up with a unique
[SPEAKER_02]: collector's ID number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it'll be stored in the bank under
your group name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it ever comes to the point where
you'd like to use some of your seed for
[SPEAKER_02]: restoration or whatever, you can query
based upon that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a picture of the paper bag
that has Clara, my co-worker's last name,
[SPEAKER_02]: Holmes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's her first collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's Marsbee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the project that she's
working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the seed lot number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of picking the seeds,
very easy, very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure they're mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick them off of the panicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to put any other material
in the bag because that could alter the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture content of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just strip the seeds right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can also toss them into a tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I've had this experience where
it's been really windy when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting and you need something a little
sturdier than a paper bag because it just
[SPEAKER_02]: flies away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put a tarp under the tree or
have a heavier bucket or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the minimum fill line that I
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that crease is right at three
inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's at what we need at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to fill the whole bag,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're also going to need a twig
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for identification purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a few specimens last year that it
was just kind of like, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this green or is this white?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking that twig sample, it's about six
to nine inches long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pull all the leaves off and chuck it
in the bag with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can help with identification purposes
and it's an important part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the twig and the seeds have
been collected, you want to label your
[SPEAKER_02]: bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ignore these pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure you have your last
name and the number of the collection and
[SPEAKER_02]: then Mars B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fold them down and staple them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the seed doesn't explode
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to send them off to
Midterm Seed Bank, which is in Staten
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll give you that information when
your collection is ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go over all your data before we
actually send them to the seed bank,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Forest Service Seed Bank in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also going to need two photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is an up close photo of the trunk of
the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for identification purposes,
showing your seed lot identification
[SPEAKER_02]: number on the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is going to be the
whole tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is to kind of see the landscape
that the tree is a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier to just email those photos
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do good copies, but you don't
have to go through that hole if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you've picked them, just basic
concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave them in your car if it's a
super hot day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the seeds to roast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be dry-ish, but remain cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of around 30% humidity, if that helps
anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put them in sort of a cool
cupboard or maybe in your basement if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the seeds get shipped to the bank,
they're kept in that nice sort of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of dry-ish climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're chilled also to make sure if
you missed any weevils, that the weevils
[SPEAKER_02]: will come out and stay in that collection
of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just went over that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then yeah, they're frozen at very,
very, very cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how they're kept for up to 50
years is because we essentially stop any
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism that's happening and that seed
comes to a halt, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the information about your
collections are recorded in this national
[SPEAKER_02]: information network that's called GRIN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually look up your seed and
see it there and all that information in
[SPEAKER_02]: that database.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ways that you can help is, again,
helping us find these trees this fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it's a pretty spotty seed
production year, but we know that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten reports particularly from the
southern and around the Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to collect more green ash
and more black ash in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we'll take whatever so long as it's a
naturally occurring tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in collecting other
species, the associated species,
[SPEAKER_02]: please do reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to, as I said,
go through and sort of make a smaller list
[SPEAKER_02]: of species that you could focus on if you
felt like that was something you wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my email is ash.marsby at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So A-S-H dot M-A-R-S-B at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another project that
we're also involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have multiple partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still kind of coming up with an
informational sort of outreach toolkit for
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but we're working with the New York
Botanical Garden and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arboretum, among others, to try and work
on this question of ash biogenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's not a whole lot that's
known about the distinction between
[SPEAKER_02]: species in the Phraxinus genus and the ash
genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this project is hoping to sort of
take a finer grade, closer look at where
[SPEAKER_02]: those distinctions may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be, you know,
really important for determining which
[SPEAKER_02]: species are more susceptible to emerald
ash borer and how we can assure that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, you know, conserving that's really
important genus of trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that project, we need citizen
scientists to help us make collections of
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and herbarium specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can have samples for the
herbarium, but also the DNA that we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at those phylogenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a number of different projects
that we have on our plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a lot of help, but I think it's,
you know, a really fun way to be involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in native plant conservation and a really
important cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need more than one ash tree to
participate, or is one okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you collect from a tree that's already
infected by the emerald ash borer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, sometimes if you have a
really badly infested tree, it'll put out
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called a stress crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of like, oh,
I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I better make a last ditch effort to get
my genes out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll try really hard, but those seeds
will be kind of shriveled and empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see that your tree is infested
and it has seeds, just make sure you do
[SPEAKER_02]: that viability check.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they look great, we'll take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there areas in the state that you are
most interested in having seeds from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, we didn't get that much seed
from the Adirondacks last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but from what I hear from scouts,
there's not really much going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one area that we missed a little
bit last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year, we're trying to focus on
lakes region, and we're hoping that
[SPEAKER_02]: because it does have such a heavy,
heavy density of ash in the canopy,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we'll be able to find something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all sort of along like Buffalo and
Rochester, along that lake shore would be
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anywhere, honestly, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we don't have any other questions
coming in, either we thank you again for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining us and thank Molly for sharing
that information with us, and good luck in
[SPEAKER_00]: the months ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you very much, Laurie,
and thanks everyone for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
