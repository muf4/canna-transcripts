[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everyone to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank Rossi here with Dr. Ben McGraw from
Penn State University who we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to a little bit and talk about insects
from the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trying to do this for a while
and it's been a funky spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me start out like I usually do with
putting our kids to work on the golf
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, this became something that got
popular during the pandemic and so pleased
[SPEAKER_01]: to see golf course superintendents
exposing their kids like this to the work
[SPEAKER_01]: and being outside and the toils of what we
love about being on golf courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of us know not long ago we lost Dr.
Joe Vargas, a friend of mine and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: an acquaintance of Ben's over the years
from Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been quiet about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe was a really important part of my
early career.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started at Michigan State and
the guy next to him was no slouch himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordy LaFontaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost Joe just a month ago and they had
the service for him this past weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this picture you can see Gordy
LaFontaine holding the mic for Dr. Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Rieke who just celebrated his 90th
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we grieve the passing of a turf
grass giant, we continue to celebrate
[SPEAKER_01]: having Dr. Rieke around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having roots as a Sparty for my couple
of years there early on still touches my
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe always had a smile and a kind word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those people who always might have
had a difficult time with Joe,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got along with him perfectly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all crusty North Easterners.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a classic New Englander from the
get go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this past week we were pretty
warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warm to the East as you got near the ocean
and even North, you were pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you got towards central
Pennsylvania and West, you got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places in the high elevations,
eight degrees below normal where you were
[SPEAKER_01]: really up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cooler towards the Southwest and warmer
towards the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's been really interesting is
we're starting to see heat stress levels
[SPEAKER_01]: already build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are models that we developed
when the nighttime temperature is at least
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 degrees and the combination of the
temperature and the humidity is over 150.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more than five or six hours,
we call that heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you can see here is the heat
stress is going to be with us downstate
[SPEAKER_01]: and even in Southwest Pennsylvania,
Ben, where you are, and then slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: dissipate as the week goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not expecting to see much of this
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's also interesting, typically
follows this when you get moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: are foliar diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally we talk about dollar spot,
but whenever the heat starts to build,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start to see it building towards
the Southwest today and tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really only persists in the Boston
area, the Metro New York area,
[SPEAKER_01]: the I-95 corridor down to Washington DC in
places where Brown Patch is likely to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would want to make sure I had some
protection in place along the shore and
[SPEAKER_01]: the I-95 corridor south of New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking like it's going to be a
pretty good run for Brown Patch for the
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils are warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, they've been getting warm and
as they in places where they're drier,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're even warmer well into the
seventies in Metro New York and pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much sixties everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biological activity is well underway in
all the soils in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as the rainfall comes with warm
soils, you could expect a surge of growth
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other side of that if your soil is
functioning, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If your soil is really able to process the
organic matter, mineralize that nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should get a growth response on the
other side of some expected rainfall
[SPEAKER_01]: that's passing through the Northeast this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been wet in Bean Town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Red Sox are not loving it as
wet as it's been and also a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: down by U-Ben, in Southwest Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like you got a little bit of
rainfall down there, but really for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part, the majority of the region has
been dry this past week and it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really liked these
prognostications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it might be warmer than
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it might be a little bit
wetter than normal, but what we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about in our sort of extension
conference call world has been the
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns of rainfall are coming through,
but we may not be getting that much rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we might get a bit of a dump through
a storm coming through in the next day or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, but it looks like rainy, showery
conditions, but not major rainfall
[SPEAKER_01]: expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Ben, I had a laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I used to watch my kids play soccer,
I didn't bother sitting with anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stood off by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a big yeller, but I didn't also
want to be near anybody because on the off
[SPEAKER_01]: chance something happened, I'm likely to
just punch them as a reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this was a very interesting time
and you tweeted about it, so I won't talk
[SPEAKER_01]: more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get into marital issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my own trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into our conversation today,
Ben, and let's start with something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: very pertinent to New York, although maybe
not necessarily this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are deaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are expecting a ban of neonicotinoid
insecticides across the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably likely going to happen in
other places as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt we're going to be an isolated
state for this particular rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little bit about
alternatives and worries because on Long
[SPEAKER_01]: Island, we don't have a celebrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a limitation for some of our use
down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start out with how worried are you
about this and how much confidence do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have in alternatives like I put up here,
entomophagus nematodes and maybe BT
[SPEAKER_01]: galerii?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into some difficult
talk here right from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a talk at the New England Turf
Regional Conference and somebody came up
[SPEAKER_00]: to me and was like, hey, I'm from,
because they draw from Long Island at that
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, we don't have a celebrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the softest chemistries that
we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It impacts or it affects the insect by
binding to a receptor that humans don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have, so it's virtually nontoxic to
mammals, a safety applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one of those crazy things that you
don't have in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was unaware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing with the neonic issue is
it's changing by the month here in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the states around us, Maryland,
New Jersey, Connecticut, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep up on all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My home state of Maine has moved to a
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written lots of letters and all of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think we have better alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to support the turf industry in
writing letters and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some pretty clear science
that in the turf grass world, it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge issue because we're watering these
products in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any white grub product, you need to
deliver it down to the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That removes a lot of the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the ability to get water
to these sites, maybe it's an estate or a
[SPEAKER_00]: park or a golf course rough where we
typically would see these grubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who don't have
irrigation to rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by selecting a granular formulation
immediately removes the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's work that Dan Potter did 100 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to work with neonics that you
can minimize the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the hubbub?
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it was about seed treatments in
ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that minimize risk as well by just
putting it on the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm getting with this is I'd love to
see turf treated differently as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: banning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hysteria and nobody's really willing
to look at the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that seed treatment is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neonic and maybe companies could have
avoided this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that turf and ornamentals,
they're small potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to get caught in the
crossfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens with the seed treatment with
the neonics, and this science is very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, that it does impact pollinator
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is excellent work out of Purdue,
Christian Krupke's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk about somebody who did
great research that got caught in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crosshairs from these chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you place the neonic on the seed
treatment, there's a lot of evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not work in northern agriculture,
but in southern agriculture, that
[SPEAKER_00]: product's there and it gets the insects
that it needs to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: In northern, it might not, but the big
problem is when you put them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeders, it basically volatizes the
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any plume of neonicotinoid coming through
pollinating insect populations is just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smoke them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, essentially dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not volatization, but the dust coming off
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that we need to treat these
things as good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of nuances with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the turf world, what we can speak about
is you do want to, every white grub
[SPEAKER_00]: product, you want to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are products that water in,
and once you water it in, they're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's blanket treatment and
there's enough momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's running downhill that it's
probably going to be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where we do have great alternatives
like the diamides, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: differences within the diamides,
so I don't want to paint with a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just a clarification, golf has
access to a celloprene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lawn care and landscape that are not
going to have the access to a celloprene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that's unfortunate, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at within the diamides,
there is great variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that a pharynx would be
similar or even a tetrino, which New York
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not the same as a celloprene as
far as pollinator safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: A celloprene, gold standard for white grub
control, really, really soft on
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about these other options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you played around with nematodes as
a grad student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we more than played with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Galerii has gotten some momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts on effectiveness, because we know
behavior is going to have to change a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering about effectiveness of these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to delve into some tricky area
here, because I've had a CEO of a company
[SPEAKER_00]: crawl upside my head about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to say is that both can be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, one is they're biological,
so we assume that they are more benign or
[SPEAKER_00]: less harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a living organism with
the nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about a BT formulation with
the grub gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the nematodes, we want to overwhelm
them with high numbers of very healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, in fact, of juveniles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we can do that, we can overwhelm the
pest population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known this for decades and decades
and decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to be very careful in
really getting viable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably get some ire from some
biological supply companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have concerns about the quality
control of the nematode.
100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do studies with nematodes all the time,
and we get them from online sources or in
[SPEAKER_00]: sectories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you, because I did do this for
my PhD, that we get batches upon batches
[SPEAKER_00]: that are entirely dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an uncommon thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was doing this, and I think they're
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody who's using nematodes
to control annual bluegrass weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we showed in our work,
you could get 90% control of larvae with a
[SPEAKER_00]: single application.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're comparable in price to our
insecticides that we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot of like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in Canada, in certain crops,
it's very well adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushroom production, Southeast PA,
there's nematodes being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this kind of market thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't store well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to recycle them through a live
hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be rather expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to make sure that I have a
viable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to make sure that they're
alive on delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big shift, Ben, because the
nematodes are going to go on as you scout
[SPEAKER_01]: in August, not as a preventative in June,
are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be using them primarily in a
curative sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was work done at Cornell
about these long-term persistent
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson Seals been playing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about B.
p.
[SPEAKER_01]: galerii?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot in field trials, because any time a
company has a natural product that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to test, this is usually a standard
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reams of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleagues have reams of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put up a slide a couple of years ago in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of the slide was consistently
inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately received some emails from
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not beholden to the company or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm beholden to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Ben?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've learned is if I've got people
angry at me, it must be because I'm saying
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's true as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me, if it worked, I'd be the
number one promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had trials where it's given good
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had trials where there's absolutely
no control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a little bit more
stable, but it's going to have variation
[SPEAKER_00]: between batches as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this is more typical that you'd put
on in the spring as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be something that you'd want to
put in July so that it's in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't really describe it as a
preventive, but you'd probably want to
[SPEAKER_00]: time it so that when the neonate bites
into it, that they acquire the most amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of toxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of ground to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: ABW is next, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of funky stuff going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with this question because as
not an entomologist, the general extension
[SPEAKER_01]: person in the state, I get a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've really said, okay, there's degree
day models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, we've talked about this on the show
in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really rely on phenological indicators
and the rhododendron tends to be a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a disconnect this year between
degree days, phenological indicators,
[SPEAKER_01]: and annual bluegrass weevil populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that in my travels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we take a lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use very precise methods of analyzing
what stage the insects are in as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the larval stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to think that a golf course
superintendent could do this, but it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be super time consuming to get the level
of accuracy that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I will say that these things
generally seem to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started seeing people say,
man, as variable as it is every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it always lands on Memorial Day,
and I would tend to agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of variability at the
beginning of the season, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything comes together almost in a
calendar basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our growing degree days have been
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a picture from Matthew Legg talking
about just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear this all the time from Andy Wilson
at Beth Page, who's a big scouter,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see it at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured maybe with the mild winter and a
funky spring, it got a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to hear it didn't because that
means maybe control programs are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew Legg with Syngenta Canada just put
this on Twitter yesterday, and you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: these variety of growth stages here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we call this asynchrony, or do you call
asynchrony when you have multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, Ben?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say asynchrony arises from
probably a lack of control of adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what's going to lead to
asynchrony is if you have something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at that, if I take a core and I
see, let's just say those are first,
[SPEAKER_00]: second, third, and fourth in SARS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they are or not, just for example
sake, we got four in stars there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says to me something laid an egg
seven days ago, 14, 21, 28 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a population of adults that are
out there laying eggs for over a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if we don't control the
adult, the adult has a very long time that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can produce eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we know that from confined field
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they live that long in the field,
probably not, but if we have them
[SPEAKER_00]: confined, they can lay eggs for a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we also see is even in areas where we
do have an adulticide down, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the entire population.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some asynchrony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say if you took enough larval
samples or enough turf samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat extracted, and look at them
underneath microscope, you would have an
[SPEAKER_00]: average that is moving pretty
consistently, whether you applied an
[SPEAKER_00]: adulticide or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That raises a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have all these products in New
York, but these products seem to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: rage when it comes to larvicides,
if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've started to hear, and I know you have
cautioned against this in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of pyrethroid resistant
adult populations, as you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like BethPage have really gone away
from completely trying to make adulticide
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know those things can cause issues when
we're trying to control larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyrethroid resistant ABWs can be
differentially susceptible to larvicides,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I think you've taught me in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you like these products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the other comment you made that
still resonates the last time we were on
[SPEAKER_01]: is you basically said, Frank, we got
enough products now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know enough about this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this is a major pest problem
anymore that can't be managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the problems that we used to have
are not the problems controlling we have
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit nervous because relying
on larvicides, as you said, could be
[SPEAKER_01]: risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how to put this into context
without an adulticide and relying on a
[SPEAKER_01]: larvicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I just making three larvicide
applications now instead of three
[SPEAKER_01]: adulticide applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear this up for me, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that sequential applications
are needed, whether that's an adulticide
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by a larvicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of consulting courses that
I do on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken these places that have
probably made four springtime
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're two and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're even looking whether we need to
make a summer application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these are super high-end and
that's really an insurance act.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I really like the adulticide
followed by a larvicide, but I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: some people don't want to go that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still caution against relying on a
single product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wrapped our two weeks of field
trial data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of the submissions
that these companies have made are these
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a big believer in programs,
but from a recommendation standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult for me to say this
solo product does this unless we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at that solo product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other complicating thing is the insect
is going to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to lay eggs over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at the contribution of a
single larvicide, that could be difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to assess because it's got to work on much
longer that spread out asynchronous
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think we have a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, from our trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our trials were great this year,
so I think it's going to be a banner year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming off a couple of crap years
where it's like, am I going to work the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of my life on ants and earthworms and
these unsolvable things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we get back to the early 2000s ABW
level?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen is some places that have
been really bit hard, but I do think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the places that I consult with or a lot
of the places where we have trials where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing what we recommend,
those things are non-problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really about timing,
as we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about using products that
make sense relative to the life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot of freestyling though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people have chemical sheds
where you've got eight things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think are recognizable that you heard in a
talk somewhere, but people are absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: frigging freestyling out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not on Facebook, but if somebody
shared a Facebook, post where it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the best product for ABW larval
control?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw about 20 responses from these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a sequential program with two
products that are not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think this insect doesn't occur
uniformly across a property.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, people are going to
think that they get good control with
[SPEAKER_00]: marginal products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this year is going to really flesh
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to recap what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your studies, your trials are indicating,
we got a lot of annual bluegrass weevils
[SPEAKER_01]: out there this year after a couple of
years of not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No surprise on the Facebook baloney,
but the social media thing, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things we don't get right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be very careful when you're
making choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like once you get enough data
and you are able to start making timely
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, this no longer is going to
be a primary issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, it's expanding its range,
Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it behaving differently the further
south you get, the further into Ohio you
[SPEAKER_01]: get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any nuances that are different
for this organism as it's expanded its
[SPEAKER_01]: range from the Northeast where it's been
for 40 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been spraying this thing for 40 years
since I was working our golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that I say would be purely
anecdotal other than we do have one site
[SPEAKER_00]: in Columbus and we work pretty closely
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started to have problems and we
implemented a program that would be what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or New
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a couple of years, they're
practically non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest problems that they're
having there is the education that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody would roll their eyes about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, as an extension educator,
it's almost difficult because I've got two
[SPEAKER_00]: sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got people who are like, I don't need
to know about the biology anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the people that really just need
the ABCs of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we overthink these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a course to do with business
in the Northeast and now it's a new issue
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to put in their rhythm down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, we're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the last thing is it's a much
more complex turf pest than any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other turf pests that have one generation
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a product that you can put down
within three-month window and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this just involves a little bit
more being on the ball and selecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: right products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to bring up an unsolvable problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to bring it up, but I'm going to,
but I saw this yesterday that analids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are worms, as a biomass on the
planet have more biomass than humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: livestock, and wild animals put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an indication that there's a lot
of worms, a lot of biomass in the world on
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start a little bit with some stuff
that went away and now has come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The irritant approach with the saponins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a product at a golf course I visited
just the other day called Castaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't appear like we're trying to
disguise this anymore, that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling worms with early birds,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts on this as a primary strategy for
addressing worm issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saponins work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is there's some variability
between products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at Castaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like Rhizo-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like early bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a physical disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It irritates their mucous-y skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequential applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get anything that's in
a cocoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get marginal kill and you still
have some adults out there, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very stable populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a couple of cocoons every
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in the cocoon is just going to
hatch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you get 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's suppression with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it every 21 days, three times in
a row, we can flatline these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't know anybody who can
afford to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of it is astronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see with products, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to call half of the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say 95% of the products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see a product that says it doesn't
kill them, it deters them, that's one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say BS on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says it doesn't kill them,
it just stops them from casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask you, Frank, is there any
organism that eats and doesn't shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: planet earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I read my kids a book called Every One
Think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a small community here where
information is free flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was explaining this to my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like the turf industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't believe that there are
companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the data that show that these
things do not work that they are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with, that they commission that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still promote these kind of things
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're going to kill an
earthworm is if you physically disrupt it
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it gets into its nervous system,
which is very similar in sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we deal with it in our
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at cultural practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your colleague, Kyle, is doing some
awesome stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to go to Paige's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Paige's work at Arkansas
because this made my head explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a beautiful video on Paige's work
that you can find on YouTube when she was
[SPEAKER_01]: at Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've commented on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just talk about the disparity
between what I hear in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest for large volumes of sand and
what Paige has said and what you have
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, a soil root zone with light top
dressing, lots of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil root zone, heavy top dressing,
not many worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sand root zone, but none of these were
statistically significant, said Paige.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we got these differences,
the variability, and this is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things Kyle laments to me all the time,
is finding uniform populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you got to be on the road all
the time to find populations you can
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light top dressing may reduce casting
activity in a soil root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top dressing rate may not have any effect
in a sand-based root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you provide any indication of where
using sand or an abrasive material,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Williamson did blackjack many
years ago to find glass stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts about deterring
them through sand top dressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I would say these are probably
different worms than that we're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the lack of statistical
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make too many inferences,
but what I can say with our species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Aperodactoidea longa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like fairly common in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a European species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to submit that as a
short publication for the international
[SPEAKER_00]: press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any reviewers out there that
are looking, willing to look the other way
[SPEAKER_00]: on variability and understand that this is
a lower tier journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw over a three-year period with
top dressing at fairway rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, heavy and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we really increased in last year
is we saw more casting in heavy top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing and light too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the light was heavier casting than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I thought it was like,
you know, maybe it irritates them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they feed more, but that didn't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found a, published article in
agriculture where they looked at sand
[SPEAKER_00]: content within the areas where earthworms
were feeding and it led to a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: digestibility of their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a chicken with a crop,
you know, they've got to grind down that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material and that allowed them to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time that we saw it, it was
almost immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ratings that we took right after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we applied these to the same plots
year after year for three year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kept going up and up and up in
these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relatively, it's the untreated control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different earthworms, very poorly
understood group, which is surprising
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're a large, you know,
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most part we look to
agriculture and try to do the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want to promote them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like what we've been looking
at recently is like compacting because we
[SPEAKER_00]: do see in agriculture in between rows of
crops, they have less earthworms and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of studies on that,
that compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might impact the cocoons and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't compact them enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, if you've got a lot of
organic material in there and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running a roller over these fairway plots,
it's really that sponge effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably, you probably can't compact
them enough in turf until you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose turf because you've compacted it so
greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're kind of looking at these
things again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think moisture is a big component to
that, but as far as the cultural practices
[SPEAKER_00]: of top dressing, I think there's just so
much organic material for them in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing too, is they feed on leaf
material on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're going to get rid of all
that leaf material, I mean, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why this is somewhat unsolvable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so I know we are already way past
and I don't see any questions for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some things about ants,
but I'm going to save them for another
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just say it is a conundrum for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go out to that Pacific Northwest
and I see, and these superintendents swear
[SPEAKER_01]: by it, they'll say, Frank, I got two
inches of sand over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one inch over there and I got worms
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a species difference or is it the
per, you know, they got a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: climate than we got out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that's Ireland sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, speaking of Ireland, we just did a
lot of the work last September went over
[SPEAKER_00]: and we tried to survey these kind of where
we see abrupt changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I always fascinated about
where you have casting that stops in a
[SPEAKER_00]: straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we selected sites that had this,
we went to these sites, we did paired
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling, sent them to Micah and
Brookside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at every variable in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it with the Pennsylvania samples as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two sites are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't saying you'd have,
I mean, we had them on slopes where you
[SPEAKER_00]: would think like they roll down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were higher casting on slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, a lot of these courses in Ireland,
really high pH, sand top, sand cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 12 inch sand cap and they're casted
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's hard to generalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think like the first thing that
anybody needs to do when they do earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: work is what species are you dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would just go way back and it's
like, oh, earthworm, like I wouldn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to say weevil, like, you know,
if it was an entomological study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are great differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these things can tolerate a great
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think soil pH is one that people
always talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got to acidify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll see in the literature that
these earthworms can handle a very wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a pH of three,
you're probably going to struggle to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: turf grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between four and 10, we're okay with
most species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I got to say, as we wrap it up,
I mean, when I remember, I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: chatting with Jim Beard, the father of
many moons ago, and he had just finished
[SPEAKER_01]: some work looking at the maintenance
practices at St. Andrew's in the 17 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 1800s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-development of synthetic salt-based
fertilizers like ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had used so much, you know,
animal manure and leaf mold, and they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: created so much organic matter on the old
course that actually there was talk that
[SPEAKER_01]: the game of golf would not continue
because they couldn't get a playable
[SPEAKER_01]: surface because of the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until the caustic ammonium
sulfate was developed that they could put
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and really irritate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally saved the game of golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lest we think worms aren't a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know St. Andrew's fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Moore's memoir right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He attributes it to putting out sand on
the old course that they had earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: problems when he started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been in the early 90s
when he was working with Walter Woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, every time I've been
to St. Andrew's, I find worm castings on
[SPEAKER_00]: the first fairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard as a frigging rock there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't find a firmer surface,
maybe Royal Melbourne, but man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate you doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope our travels pass each other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Have a great day.
