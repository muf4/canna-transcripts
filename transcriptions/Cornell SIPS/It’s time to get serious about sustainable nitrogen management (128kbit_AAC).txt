[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three sources of fixed nitrogen
used in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and by far the most widely used
source is nitrogen fertilizer derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Haber-Bosch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, biological nitrogen fixation,
accounts for about 30% of the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third and least important is a group
of harvested or mined sources such as fish
[SPEAKER_00]: waste and Chilean nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, organic farmers combine
leguminous cover crops with small
[SPEAKER_00]: additions of compost to maintain soil
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works for some farming systems such
as grain production, where biological
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixation accounts for the
majority of newly added nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, others, such as most fresh
vegetable enterprises, rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: animal-based compost as the major source
of nitrogen and are therefore indirectly
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on Haber-Bosch nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: While recycling nutrients is a fundamental
principle of agriculture, for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, the use of animal manures for
nitrogen is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, there are consequences for the
production system, including nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: imbalances, excessive soil phosphorus
levels, increased weed pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and greater vulnerability to environmental
nutrient losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a broader perspective, the dependence
on Haber-Bosch nitrogen undermines claims
[SPEAKER_00]: that organic agriculture is a more
sustainable production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founders of organic agriculture got it
right when they prohibited the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: Haber-Bosch nitrogen and chose biological
nitrogen fixation as the primary source of
[SPEAKER_00]: new nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological nitrogen fixation is a
sustainable, solar-powered nitrogen source
[SPEAKER_00]: that promotes soil organic matter accrual
and restores internal cycling processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, production of Haber-Bosch
nitrogen is highly fossil-fuel dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: and significant greenhouse gas emissions
result from this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of Haber-Bosch nitrogen used is
massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global usage for this year is forecast to
be 116 million metric tons of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this five-minute presentation,
1,100 metric tons of new nitrogen will be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, Haber-Bosch nitrogen is
extremely inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, half of this nitrogen is lost
to the biosphere, leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: eutrophication and greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely that we've already altered the
global nitrogen cycle to a point where the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra nitrogen is driving irreversible
changes in the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond these environmental concerns,
new knowledge about the role of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome, the microbial communities
associated with plants, points the way
[SPEAKER_00]: towards sustainable nutrient management
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants and their microbiomes have been
co-evolving for 700 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In greater understanding of the role of
the plant microbiome, has overturned our
[SPEAKER_00]: view of plant nutrient acquisition and
biological soil processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decomposition is a case in point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until recently, decomposition has been
viewed as a microbially governed process
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in bulk soil independent of
plants, a view compatible with the
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy of delivering available nitrogen
directly to crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now clear that a continuum of plant
microbial associations govern
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can stimulate decomposition by
providing carbon to decomposers in
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange for nitrogen and other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon provides energy to subsidize
the cost of expensive exoenzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposers must make to free nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This exchange of carbon for nutrients in
the rhizosphere provides an efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: means for delivering nitrogen to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that even under optimal
fertilizer management regimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: crops still rely heavily on soil organic
nitrogen pools, reflecting their
[SPEAKER_00]: co-evolution with decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in conventionally managed
grains receiving recommended fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, fertilizer nitrogen accounts for
less than 40% of the nitrogen taken up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: To promote sustainable nitrogen
management, we need to use systems
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that includes ecological and
evolutionary mechanisms as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to manage nitrogen and carbon
together and build soil nutrient reserves
[SPEAKER_00]: so that crops can take advantage of
mechanisms developed in the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: co-evolution with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This approach will lead to a cascade of
beneficial shifts in agro ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: functions that support sustainable food
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic certification rules need to be
modified to promote biological nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation as the primary nitrogen source in
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is right to begin weaning organic
agriculture away from Haber-Bosch nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: dependence.
