[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you all for coming to the
seminar today, and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation from Plant Biology to come
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really cool for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Michigan State, we talk a lot about
Cornell, and I see at least one go green
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love sending our students to you guys,
and we also love talking about you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we try to benchmark a lot of our
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our faculty are Cornell grads,
and hopefully we send a good number of
[SPEAKER_00]: students your way, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breadth of plant sciences here at
Cornell is very much within my comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, similar to MSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 180 faculty that work on
plants at MSU, so quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the breadth from genes and genomes
all the way to food security, food safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new building, just for those of
you who haven't been to MSU in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea for this building, this is kind
of a translational hub, and you'll look at
[SPEAKER_00]: my research that I'm going to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the stuff I talked with Chris Smart
about is more translational than the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, how did you get in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I share a lab with Xingying He.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of Alan's proteges, and Greg
Howe, who works on insect interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Christophe Benning, Dean Dela Penna.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that this building bridges the
gap between the crop and soil sciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and soil sciences, and the
fundamental research in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just some of the new things that
we are doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In large part, what I'm going to talk
about today is framed by the history of my
[SPEAKER_00]: training as a post-doc and then as a
graduate student, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a post-doc in Brian Sasowitz's lab,
and then as an early assistant professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In large part, when I arrived at MSU,
I was convinced that our genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: effector genes were going to solve all of
the world's problems, and we'd just find
[SPEAKER_00]: those magic bullets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of really deep drills on
understanding the basic mechanisms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and pathogens communicate,
and in large part, these are great
[SPEAKER_00]: tractable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about one or two of
these today in my talk, but resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes from plants are recognized by
specific avialance genes or broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: effector proteins and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this interaction and the function of
other auxiliary proteins, chaperones,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, that give yield to
species-level interactions in host range
[SPEAKER_00]: and resistance, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these, as I started working in
Brian's lab, we had this general diagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bifurcation here that once a pathogen
is recognized, it signals through one of
[SPEAKER_00]: two broad pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is EDS1, which Jane Parker's group has
really done a remarkable job in defining
[SPEAKER_00]: the processes that function through this
pathway in a number of other labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: also in this pathway, GEN, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research initiated by working on a
protein called NDR1, and NDR1 is required
[SPEAKER_00]: for the activity of a specific class of
CC, NB, LRR class of proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like any genetic screen, death is a
great and easy phenotype to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NDR1 was one of, it's kind of our nude
mouse model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just look at, and still it's the bane
of my graduate students that work on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: their existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at this plant, it just gets sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working towards understanding
and defining what role NDR1 plays in
[SPEAKER_00]: broader immunity, but to do that,
we've really taken a different approach
[SPEAKER_00]: and asked, what is the function of NDR1 in
the absence of a pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is really the power of
using effector proteins in this day and
[SPEAKER_00]: age with genome sequencing and
transcriptome analysis, and really the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to easily collect the diversity of
pathogen isolates and their hosts from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world is understanding how did
critical proteins, these auxiliary
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, or these resistance and AVL or
AVR proteins evolve from a basal function,
[SPEAKER_00]: a physiological function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, six to seven years ago,
you had to really use a rabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a comment last night at dinner,
and I think the chair of plant biology
[SPEAKER_00]: made a comment about model systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model systems are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rabidopsis is a great model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this day and age, if you've got an
Illumina, HiSeq, or even a MiSeq,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just set your plant next to it,
sequence it, and it becomes a model
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the scariest realizations that I
had, I'm talking with Xing Yang a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, I said, Xing Yang, do you know
how many people work on a rabidopsis in
[SPEAKER_00]: MSU?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually nine of us,
nine out of the 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of the people now are working on
potatoes, a really important field of
[SPEAKER_00]: study at MSU, tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some work in cucumber, but all of
these systems have quickly become model
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, I think they're
important ecosystems to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're important for food security and
ultimately for food health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now using effector proteins, I'm obligated
to show this slide, so I apologize in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to show a slide like this,
but this will be the last and only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using these effector proteins,
we can probe immune systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can probe human systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far fewer factors in human cells,
but they can use these to define the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological processes that not only
regulate immunity, but they can really
[SPEAKER_00]: define the regulation of these in the
absence of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do the same types of things with
plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got ubiquitination processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRPTO is one of the, if you don't know
AVRPTO, maybe there's a seminar down the
[SPEAKER_00]: hall that you should be going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Greg Martin, Alan Comer's group,
they really, you know, all of this DC 3000
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point of this slide is really just
to illustrate the breadth of targeting and
[SPEAKER_00]: the breadth of processes that are involved
in immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immunity is not just R genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just AV reliance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what my lab has done is we've taken
a step back and said, let's forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: the R genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tractable systems, but let's focus
on the physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what my lab has been focusing on is a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is because we are a land grant
university at Michigan State, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a number of crops, we started working
on using a functional genomics approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand cucumber downy mildew
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I used to, I used to giggle a
little bit when I'd say this, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, if you eat a pickle east of Denver,
Colorado, that pickle came from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the number one producer of pickles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a land grant university,
when you've got these partnerships with
[SPEAKER_00]: industries, it's quite easy to get
industry funding to work on an important
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started working on this,
but we totally, you know, we took the
[SPEAKER_00]: really the gene jockey based approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took it out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started developing the resources so
that we could deploy these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've, you know, we've made some
market progress in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: One recent paper I want to just point out,
just came out a few months ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: a week ago, is on a genome wine survey of
alternative splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this really kind of is
representative of this new area of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in my lab, is asking how
pathogens can reprogram their host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in turn, how a host can respond at a
transcriptional level to develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve resistance responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in turn, the pathogen can evolve
virulence responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also work on obviously plant
pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it was Alan that has
said this to me before, but NDR1 is really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an enigma in a black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what this protein does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show a picture here that
I think we've got at least a snarky idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I'm going to talk largely
about today is the function of actin
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actin is, as I mentioned, is broadly
required for a number of host processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is targeted by pathogens in both
plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real key of understanding and
really kind of bolstering my interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing and shifting the focus of the lab
to actin was an observation that we made
[SPEAKER_00]: while working on NDR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, let's see what the
actin cytoskeleton looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, this is evidence that my
graduate students will agree, NDR1 is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, for those of you who are
not absolute nerds, this is from a popular
[SPEAKER_00]: movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't illustrate my nerddom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what the actin cytoskeleton
looks like in an NDR1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wild type Columbia stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be kind of the focus
of my talk today, is kind of defining how
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity regulates actin cytoskeleton
dynamics and how pathogens have evolved to
[SPEAKER_00]: target this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to give you just a
brief introduction to the actin pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk just a couple of slides
about some published work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of what I'm going to show is some
new and unpublished data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd welcome comments and opportunities
to kind of entertain the idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, you're crazy, or, oh, wow,
this is really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
effector targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a genetic screen,
and with help from a postdoc in Xin Yang's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, Brian Kavitko, who was a graduate
student with Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've identified two effectors that
specifically target the actin cytoskeleton
[SPEAKER_00]: with opposing activities, much like what's
observed in salmonella interactions with
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, down to the regulation
of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will get us into another effector
protein that specifically targets a
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium-dependent protein kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what I'm going to show here is
largely grounded in the unifying theme of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative imaging at the plant pathogen
interface and some new techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broadly, the actin cytoskeleton is
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what the cover of our
journals are sometimes littered with,
[SPEAKER_00]: just these really sexy pictures of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actin cytoskeleton is involved in
determining cell shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in processes such as gene
expression, growth, pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: development, stomata open and closing,
not only during pathogen infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: but during the diurnal cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work for me in Stugard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about seven or eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really one of the first images,
these are static images, that showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: the actin cytoskeleton was, they could
somewhat quantitatively assess the
[SPEAKER_00]: rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in
response to a microbial infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a rhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lotus japonicus root here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that during the infection
process, you go from these transverse
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements of the actin cytoskeleton
more towards these longitudinal processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in large part, that mediates the
growth, the orientation, the development
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root here, which ultimately lead to
nodule formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a platform for pathogens,
arguably some of the best work has come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the work of Listeria and other
pathogens, Yersinia pestis, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: which demonstrate a couple of mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Yersinia pestis, the pathogen
targets actin cytoskeleton somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly by shutting down phagocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeria, I think this is just really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeria actually expresses actin binding
proteins, actin polymerizing binding
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins on its cell surface, and can
actually usurp the actin cytoskeleton of
[SPEAKER_00]: its host and create these actin rockets,
which it uses to propel through the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: On plant pathogens, a little bit less
exciting, less cool-looking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, the actin cytoskeleton
has been demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work from Ralph Penstruga's group
showed that you can get rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton
to the site of penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's believed that this is not only as
part of the callus deposition response,
[SPEAKER_00]: but could also be involved in trafficking
not only proteins, but organelles to the
[SPEAKER_00]: site of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think about this kind of like
the fort that's being attacked by guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: are under the control of the eye of
Sauron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to reinforce your front door,
reinforce your wall, and you need to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your resources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pseudomonas syringae, not a lot is
known about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've published half a dozen or so papers,
and some in collaboration with Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: Steiger's lab, to actually ask,
how does Pseudomonas syringae manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: host actin cytoskeleton?
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that Pseudomonas remains
extracellular during its infection
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the logical explanation is it must be
doing this either one through secretion of
[SPEAKER_00]: a toxin or manipulation of some sort of
extracellular matrix component or through
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of took a little bit of
approach and asked, well, is there a PTI
[SPEAKER_00]: component?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a cellular, extracellular
component such as flagellin that
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulates actin?
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there also a secreted component
that can manipulate actin?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The static images are great, but I made a
comment this morning that microscopy is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these things that, to be honest,
you can see what you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look through the microscope and
say, oh, wow, there is some different
[SPEAKER_00]: looking stuff there, and I'm going to snap
that image and do it five, 10 times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to step away from that
and to assign, really let the computer do
[SPEAKER_00]: this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we collaborated
initially with Chris Steiger at Purdue,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had developed the TIRF
microscopy-based method and then adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: it for plant pathogens to monitor actin
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an organism, as a structure,
the actin cytoskeleton is really dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It undergoes this continuous cycle of
de-polymerization and polymerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has even slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: These filaments will grow at micrometers
per second, and they're redistributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're redistributed in a
stimulus-dependent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know the endpoints,
how an actin filament may be anchored to
[SPEAKER_00]: one portion of the cell or not,
but what we did was we said, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see if we can use this method of
monitoring, this TIRF microscopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which stands for total internal reflective
fluorescence microscopy, and take angle of
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence measurements of the actin
cytoskeleton during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just our first simplest observation
here, you can see that there are striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you even more striking images.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you inoculate a plant expressing
tagged or marked with GFP for the actin
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton, you can see a mixture of
dense arrays of filaments These are just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine filamentous structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see these periodic
alignment of bundled microfilaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you inoculate it with a virulent
strain, you can see the disappearance of
[SPEAKER_00]: this dense bundle array.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it goes into these highly
arranged bundles of actin filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask this question now, and then I'll
ask it again later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know, though, is this a
cause and effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a part of the defense response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this part of the virulence
mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where a lot of our work
using some of the strains that we got from
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan's lab has come in really handy to
enable us to really ask the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: are we looking at a virulence question
here, or are we looking at a host immune
[SPEAKER_00]: question?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this started with work from a
former postdoc in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of these dreams that I
wish upon any young assistant professor is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got kind of like the best postdoc
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in Sophia Camus' lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she was a postdoc here in Dan
Classic's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her husband had a job at Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, let's go to Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just came in and published three
papers in like three years and did a great
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately came back to Dan's lab
two more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now she's got the dream job in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are still jobs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to move to Hawaii to get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just for all you young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miao Ying did a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, let's think about actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, let's look at what's
known about actin in the mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yersinia pestis secretes a suite of
five or six YOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these YOPs stands for Yersinia outer
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're secreted effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they target row GTPases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shut down actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything in Pseudomonas
stringii that might be similar to YOPs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she screened what was at the time
some of the available SOC lines available
[SPEAKER_00]: from the resource center and screened it
against all of these Pseudomonas stringii
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's NDR1 over here, kind of our nude
mouse model control, sick in all cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she identified was in this ADF4
mutant, AVRP-PHB led to a susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really nice, quick, easy genetic
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we moved on and really
characterized that was all published six
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been focusing a little bit more on
actin depolarization factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arabidopsis, there are 11 of these
actin depolarization factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many more in plants than there are in
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many more actin isoforms in plants than
there are in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of developing this idea is
that is actin, because of the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: isoforms, is a highly specialized implant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does actin 7, for example, perform an
immune role in plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And humans are only two actin isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, like I said, have about 12,
10 are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADFs in general, they bind filamentous
F-actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break it in half, they sever it,
and then they depolymerize it into
[SPEAKER_00]: monomeric G-actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we focused on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote a proposal with Chris Steiger and
Jeff Chang, and it was funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the basic idea of this proposal was we
were going to poke every actin binding
[SPEAKER_00]: protein in Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas
stringii and then repoke it again against
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the effector proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it comes out to about a combination
of 2,100 or so pokes that we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the basic idea was to understand not
only the immune function, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F-actin is depolymerized by ADFs,
broken down, it's recharged by a capping
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, ATP loaded, becomes a substrate
for profilin, and it's added on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: minus end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this repetitive, continuous cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had begun screening some of these
for phenotypes, and we had found that if
[SPEAKER_00]: we start to perturb this cycle,
if we kind of speed it up or slow it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could speed it up potentially by
knocking out an ADF protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you don't have as many substrates
acting upon your F-actin, so you slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversion from F to G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could speed it up by over-expressing
actin and just increasing the actin pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important point is in plants,
only 5% of actin is polymerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humans, it's about 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants have this huge reservoir of
unpolymerized actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a biochemical standpoint,
you could hypothesize that this would
[SPEAKER_00]: support explosive rates of polymerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You highly regulate this population,
and when you need it, you thrust it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle here through the activity of
profilin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why you can see these
dynamic polymerization and rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: depolymerization processes I showed you a
few slides ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed this up quite quickly and
followed up Miao Ying's work by showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that ADF4 is required for
effector-triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miao Ying had already demonstrated that,
but we really wanted to ask, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we identified though is that
ADF is actually required for the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of RPS5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all of this was published a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorylation is highly diminished in an
ADF4 mutant in the presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effector AVR-PPHB.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll apologize for all the alphabet soup,
for those of you that aren't used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AVR-PPHB appears to at least target map
kinase signaling in an ADF4-dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of just some of the simple
biology here, really, demonstrating that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation in the activity of ADF4 is
phosphoregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADF4 phosphorylation leads to a
disassociation from actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the basic concept of,
it's kind of like doing a kinase assay to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate that a kinase is a kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just demonstrates that an ADF is an
ADF because it binds actin, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this phosphoregulation is also,
has an immune function demonstrating that
[SPEAKER_00]: when ADF4 is unfosphorylatable,
the plants are sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also revealed by the induction
of the hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a wild type plant, AVR-PPHB induces
an HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: When ADF4 cannot be phosphorylated,
you don't get an HR, and that ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really got us into kind of the
first deep drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk in a few slides about how
we're furthering this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the important take home here is that
ADF4 is regulated by a kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kinase appears to be associated
through some virulence activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR-PPHB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a few slides, I'm going to show you
what that kinase is and hopefully provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some evidence that there is a specific
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year we published that there was
actually ADF4 response to PAMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was where we collaborated with Chris
Steiger's lab on and showed that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually two responses in plants in
response to pathogen infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very early response that occurs
between one and three hours, where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: this burst of actin filament organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was largely attributed to the
activity of flagellin and chitin and EF2,
[SPEAKER_00]: other pathogen associated molecular
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this later response that I'm
going to show a little bit more in detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: some more unpublished data, that occurs
around 24 to 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this later response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this temporal separation,
which worked out well for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at early events that we can
genetically determine and define as being
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the function and activity
of PAMP recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got all these mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can knock out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can knock out this early response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big question, though,
was what is the pathogen doing to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This early response, we believe,
is immune related.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that this early response,
obviously, is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done all the growth curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This early response is kind of primary in
the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of the deep breath the plant
takes when the pathogen first initiates
[SPEAKER_00]: its infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this later response, we believe,
is a virulence response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a virulence mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lag period is the plant and pathogen
first shake hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they do this little dance for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the pathogen is going to win,
it's going to come back in with effector
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and further change the actin
cytoskeleton, actually change it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a density response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant starts making a lot of actin
at this early response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this kind of deep breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at this later response,
the pathogen comes in and just bundles it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bundles the actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that diminishes the
plant response, the plant ability to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this dynamic structure that's involved in
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, are there pseudomonas
syringae effectors that dampen or
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate changes in the actin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we identify these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they ultimately, just by
definition, are these effectors
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning to block PTI responses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it an actin-based PTI response?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to address this, we really started
getting into really fine details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked the question, OK,
we've got to develop a new system of how
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure changes in actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really highly quantitative, highly
unguided, we didn't want to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to be looking at 900
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each one of these experiments,
we collect about 900 images of each time
[SPEAKER_00]: point, of each data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we feed them into a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the computer tells us, yes,
this is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we collaborated with a group at the
University of Tokyo that took it one step
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually developed an algorithm
that could identify, within this
[SPEAKER_00]: population of actin, within a single cell,
four different organizationally distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: actin structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got filamentous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got longitudinally bundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got radial bundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got this dense microarray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they developed an algorithm that could
go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take all of these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feed them into Image J, do a
hierarchical clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it spits out these four
classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this, what we started asking,
and I'm just going to show you one slide
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you where we're taking this,
is can we use physiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And compare that to immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know that stomata open and close
during the diurnal cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the untrained eye, an open stomata
looks the same under light conditions as
[SPEAKER_00]: it might look under a six hour pathogen
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, they're quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of other observations that
we've identified is that the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: infection actually introduces a transient
deformation of the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red highlights there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to open and closed under diurnal
cycles, when you inoculate these with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas syringae, you get this
deformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably kind of some turgor pressure
on the adjacent cell as a result of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it recovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that an open stomata by a
pathogen looks markedly different than an
[SPEAKER_00]: open stomata by light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly bundled, highly dense radial
transverse arrays.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to here, more of a mesh network
of radials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can quantify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question was, can we go in and
use these types of analyses to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: specific effectors using plant genetics
and bacterial genetics to identify actin
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we measure these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, can we separate cause from
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we separate the immune response from
the pathogen virulence response?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just two definitions I want you to
remember for the next five or six slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I say skewness, this is really a
mathematical measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the distribution of
actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a bell-shaped distribution under
normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skewness simply means we take that bell
and we skew it to one side or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be skewness equals actin
bundling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see highly bundled arrays,
that means you have high skewness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite is highly dense arrays means
unbundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I use that word not to be simplistic
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's depolymerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's ever been
polymerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we assigned a very kind of a general
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just say it's unbundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an image like this, we would say is
highly unbundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be highly skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is mock inoculated and DC 3000
inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can see the differences
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC 3000, highly bundled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The host actin filaments, whereas the Hark
C mutant really doesn't change it
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up better here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly dense arrays, but clearly
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this became kind of our metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our first phenotype that we're
going to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's screen all of the plant mutants we
might want to screen against all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: CuCpB isolates that we got from the Colmer
lab and say, can we define a pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: within this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we narrow down a specific effector?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got these factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing is to standardize our
system, set up our system so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking our measurements at 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to eliminate any bacterial density
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a growth curve at zero hours and
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We count the bacteria in each one and we
set up the standard curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is DC 3000 at an initial inoculum
of 0.3, 0.03, 0.01, kind of our standard
[SPEAKER_00]: curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We benchmark all of Allen strains against
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we do is we inoculate our
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we would inoculate CuCpB
5500 at the same concentration as to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare with DC 3000 at a 0.01.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strain grows at an initial
concentration of 0.3 as compared to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a bit of a fitness impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main concern was we want to make
sure that in the end, we're not looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial density as cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are just the isolates you
can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through this,
but DC 3000 has all of these isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of these Cu, let's say,
5500 is basically knocked out for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta cell is the conserved effector locus
is present in all of these, but not in
[SPEAKER_00]: these, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start to line these guys up and
say which factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, you get down to two or
three strains that are missing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can knock those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our inputs was pathogen genetics using
the CuCpB strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's defined tractable growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say, OK, we know what disease looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death is a really cool, easy phenotype to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look initially at a single
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to use the power of these
overlapping effector inventories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our outputs are going to be disease
assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, using skewness and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have high bundling, you have low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skewness, excuse me, low density,
and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, kind of these opposites,
black and white, are really where you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be to benchmark these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do this using a computer
algorithm to quantify with no human input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, I'll go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all work that's in revision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we screened through all of these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've narrowed it down to a couple of
the CuCpB isolates from Allen's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we narrowed it down to about 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five effectors, actually six effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you about one of them that we're
not really following up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're playing around with it with Xin
Yang's lab a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we narrowed this one down to five
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that there were one of or multiple
of five effectors that were responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for inducing this decreased actin
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came down to this isolate here,
and then this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like salmonella, we identified that
pseudomonas syringi effectors have these
[SPEAKER_00]: opposing activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmonella has one effector that binds
host actin, and they have one that bundles
[SPEAKER_00]: host actin, one that unbundles host actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine I'm a very analogy
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: My students always tease me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine walking into this room with all
the chairs are littered in different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, and you had to walk through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would push some chairs out of the way
and take a step, then you would pull some
[SPEAKER_00]: chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the pathogen is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pushing and pulling on the actin
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the state of the immune
signaling pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk more about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that are curious,
AVRE actually induces actin polymerization
[SPEAKER_00]: in its host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with Xin Yang He's group a
little bit on AVRE.
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRE is one of the conserved effector
locus, highly important, widely abundant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has a very strong effect when you
express it in plants, either
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenically in plants or through
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately bundles the actin
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we narrowed it down from this isolate
CUCPB 549 to this effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cluster nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six or so effectors on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through and we screened all of
these looking at growth curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no real impact of growth when we
knocked out any of these individual
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really was a nice thing because
now we can do standardized assays where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're inoculating all of the same
concentrations, counting all of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we start to add back in individual
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the long story short is that it's hot
G1 actually induces actin bundling in its
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an effector that's been
worked on a little bit by another Colmar
[SPEAKER_00]: alumni, Jim Alfano, that showed that hot
G1 can actually induce cell death in its
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, I'm not going to show
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published and we're working on
getting a better repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The published results are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having trouble getting it to
work the way to the reviewer's
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot G1 appears to bind kinesin,
which is a mitochondrial localized
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinesins are motor proteins that mediate
the interaction between myosin and actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we believe our mechanism is
that hot G1 is delivered in the host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately targets kinesin in the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that induces actin bundling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actin bundling in the mitochondria,
if you PubMed search that, boom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the cool things about
actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the distribution of actin
within the cell as well as its
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, you can tickle certain
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send actin into the mitochondria in
a human cell, it initiates apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bundle actin in plant cells and
pollen cells, it induces cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that the virulence,
at least maybe one of the virulence
[SPEAKER_00]: targets of hot G1 is kinesin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires a functional actin
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It manipulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics
to initiate cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some data that demonstrates
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PC 3000 at four days induces this nice
chloridic phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out hot G1, you get no
chloridic phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add back hot G1, it's not as strong
You recover much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done chlorophyll analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover about 70% of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Kavitko is helping us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think either it's a contribution to the
CML locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we've eliminated the contribution
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we think it's a position effect,
that we're just not getting strong
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of this hot G1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to demonstrate that this is an
actin-dependent response, you can take DC
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000, you get this yellowing phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a little bit clearer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knock out the hot G1, the delta 9
cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you add back in a deplimerizing
factor, you can restore the cell death
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This experiment by itself has been done
several times, but demonstrating that hot
[SPEAKER_00]: G1 can really compensate or is additive to
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to tie up this first part of my
talk is really what we've demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: here is that pathogens modulate the host
actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there are multiple points of this
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I think this is the first
example of a pathogen-induced modulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of transcription back to the ADF story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a link there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question for us, and I'm going
to wrap up my talk with this last story,
[SPEAKER_00]: was back to this story here that Katie
Porter had published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that ADF4 is required for the
expression of RPS5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that AVR-PPHB is the effective
vector protein that tickles RPS5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know from other work, from Roger
Ennis' group, from John Minjow's group,
[SPEAKER_00]: that AVR-PPHB targets multiple proteins in
its host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got this kinase link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the function of ADF4 is
kinase-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked, again, another one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd send the postdoc to Vegas,
because she really had a good guess and it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, can we identify the kinase that
phosphorylates ADF4 and is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: this kinase targeted by AVR-PPHB?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're hoping that maybe we can
identify the virulence target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Greg Martin and his lab for
publishing this just a couple weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was looking for a slide that
demonstrated the function of kinases in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the two that I wanted to
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AVR-PTO is one of the best
characterized kinase signaling mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: through PRF and PTO kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Ennis, I'd mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR-PPHB is a cysteine protease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein that cleaves the kinase
PbS1 that leads to the activation of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xiamen Zhou's group demonstrated that not
only does PPHB cleave this kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: it cleaves about 20 others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 20 other PbS1-like proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these are functionally unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them have been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are required for the function
of FLS2, such as BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so postdoc in my lab, Iru,
said, well, let's set up this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesized that the pathogen delivers
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These effectors target a kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kinase is required for the
phosphorylation of actin, which leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took this template that Xiamen
Zhou's lab used to screen other potential
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was a bit of a naive
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, oh, well, let's just look for the
three amino acid target sites that
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR-PPHB cleaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Xiamen Zhou's group had demonstrated
BIC1, previous work by Roger Ennis' group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack Dixon's group showed that PbS1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other sites up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we said, well, just forget those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just throw this at it really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Iru identified was the CDP case,
calcium-dependent protein kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of these have this cleavage
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, are there additional
sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there recognition of this site by the
kinase, or excuse me, by AVR-PPHB,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can it cleave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big question is, are there additional
substrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were Xiamen Zhou's work saturating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are any of these substrates the
candidate that phosphorylates ADF4?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look for the effector that
targets the kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Iru found was CpK3 actually does
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: CpK3 phosphorylates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot, I forgot to put the
phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Famous last words.
[SPEAKER_00]: CpK3 phosphorylates ADF4, but more
importantly, from a plant pathology
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, CpK3 actually is cleaved by
AVR-PPHB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the experiment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you include the buffer only,
you see nice expression of AVR-PPHB.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the presence of AVR-PPHB, you get
cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we mutate this cleavage site,
we don't get cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we include a cysteine to serine
mutation, it's catalytic mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AVR-PPHB is a cysteine protease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a catalytic triad, a histine to
serine, and a histine serine and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out one of these,
we significantly reduce the cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a little bit of cleavage
here, we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you knock out both, again,
you block cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock out CpK, what does it do from
a disease resistance standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we would have predicted,
if we knock out CpK3, these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When inoculated with AVR-PPHB,
the reciprocal, we've done this about 50
[SPEAKER_00]: or 60 leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: No HR when we inoculate the plants with
AVR-PPHB, whereas with Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get an HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these plants appear to be affected
in the hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really cool is if we add in an
actin modifying agent, co-infiltrate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we restore the hypersensitive response to
wild type, kind of demonstrating that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a functional role for actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just last week type data,
but just looking at the function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinase as a relationship to actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that if you knock out the
kinase and mark the line with actin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get this really high density actin
array, indicative of an immune type
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hypothesizing that CpK3 is
evolved, excuse me, is required for
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity to Pseudomonas syringae,
and that actin is a big part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, just quantitative
analysis, but I think that the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: here is striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only 90 images, so we've got about
800 to go to get this, but it's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to wrap up, we're really focusing
on this process here of how actin
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton touches many processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immunity, again, is a great phenotype to
study, especially when death is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that CpK3 phosphorylates ADF4,
and this phosphorylation we demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: in previous paper is what kicks ADF off of
actin cytoskeleton, so that eliminates
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down or depolymerization of actin
through phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR-PPHB cleaves CpK3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the in vitro experiments now
where we do recombinant express of each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the proteins, and then we'll send it from
aspect to definitively define that
[SPEAKER_00]: cleavage point, that cleavage site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that CpK3 is required for wild
type actin filament organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we believe that actin is, or at least
CpK3, from an actin standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: ADFs are the key regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I drew it just like we
all draw the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you see a globe that's printed in
the United States, the United States is
[SPEAKER_00]: right there in the center, and it's like
the biggest country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe from the standpoint of actin,
CpK3 and ADFs are like the biggest players
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and CpK3, therefore, would represent
a key regulator of actin filament
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics, and we know that CpK is required
for resistance, and CpKs have been
[SPEAKER_00]: previously identified as involved as
required for stomata opening and closing,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we think we're on the right trail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julian Schroeder's lab published a few
years ago in PLoS Biology that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: knock out CpK3, you diminish the ABA
closure of stomata, and for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, it makes a theoretical,
logical step to say that pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: entering through stomata would require or
potentially target CpK3 to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big picture of where my lab is
primarily interested in moving is defining
[SPEAKER_00]: actin cytoskeleton as kind of the ideal
surveillance platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the neatest observations
I think we saw in that I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out this experiment of how to do it
in plants, but if you talk about actin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a review we wrote a few years
ago, you know, it's a very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 75 actin binding proteins in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 250 in humans, so it's a
tightly regulated process, but ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you push actin into the mitochondria,
you initiate death.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true in animal systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, you know, we may have some
signal with the hot G1 kinase and actin
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to the mitochondria that we
may have a similar type of process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypothesis is really that actin is
the ideal surveillance platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It touches many, many processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It touches physiological processes such as
stomata, gene expression, organelle
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and organization, as well as
immune processes such as internalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of receptor complexes, vacuolar processes,
immune signaling processes such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of RPS5, CpK3, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our big question here is can we alter
not necessarily the dynamics of the actin
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton by knocking out an actin
binding protein or over-expressing an
[SPEAKER_00]: actin binding protein, but can we alter a
cell's response by simply changing where
[SPEAKER_00]: actin is localized?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've started to mess around a little
bit with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some inducible lines and some
stable lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, can we thrust ADF4 into the
nucleus almost exclusively by putting
[SPEAKER_00]: strong nuclear localization signals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the preliminary data here is that when
we do do this, plants don't like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they really don't like it from a plant
pathologist standpoint, from a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've altered this dynamic organization of
the actin cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets back to the overarching
hypothesis that we have is that in humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is cofilin and there's ADF.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is beta actin and there's one other
actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are four, there are two ADF
proteins in humans, two actins in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, there are 12 actin isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 11 ADFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there specific partners and pairs of
these that are required for very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: responses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was glad to see Jay and Gene
Greenberg published a small little paper
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little highly specialized journal
recently that suggests that their work
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've identified HOPW1,
you may know this as HOPX, Alan,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the meeting a few years ago,
they should demonstrate that actin seven
[SPEAKER_00]: is required for immune signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever we do immunoprecipitation
experiments, we always pull down actin
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and actin two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think there are certain partners in
this kind of a lock and key mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: where ADF four may preferentially
depolymerize actin two or actin seven
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments and that this is the immune
signaling specific pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no mechanistic support for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, a lot of the evidence
out there would argue against it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of the evidence out there is human
based where there's only two actins and
[SPEAKER_00]: two ADFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have the power of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to just thank the
people this is a relatively recent lab
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, I was telling Alan, Brian's kind of
a, many of you may know Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really extroverted, a lot like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime there's a camera and a picture,
he kind of inserts himself into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's an honorary member.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was celebrating one of my postdocs
40th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all got shirts that say obey
Masaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially this is the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eru is the one that has identified the
CPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie graduated in December and she was
the ADF person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex is a new student who actually will be
spending three months in Japan this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: to do more of the actin stuff at Nagoya
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masaki is the one that has worked not only
on the hot G1 story that's in revision,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also is doing this very precise
measurement with Tokyo University on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata organization and the other people,
NDR1 and NDR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my lone cucumber student who's
graduating and moving on to really great
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to be happy to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
