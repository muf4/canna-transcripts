[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice to be invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very much appreciative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's about 5.45 here in the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are just halfway through your
day, and I'm just trying to get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: my emails and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a really nice thing to
be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Margaret said, I'm at the University
of Southampton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there for about nearly seven
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'm going to talk about the
domestication work I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is looking primarily at eggplant,
but we do have other projects looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: brassicas and some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if the slides aren't changing
or my camera dies or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Margaret will do a thumbs up or a thumbs
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my plan for the talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about why domestication
is interesting, why I personally get out
[SPEAKER_01]: of bed in the morning and I'm super
excited by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also why eggplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we want to study this species?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk about the demography
of eggplant origins, which is about where
[SPEAKER_01]: it originated, how many times it was the
crop domesticated, looking at gene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression divergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is using RNAseq in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some work looking at selective
sweeps in the genome, and we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: zooming in on one of these traits as well,
trying to get down to some candidate genes
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to quickly go through the three main
collaborators that I've been working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna Page, she was a PhD student,
graduated about a year ago from my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jane Gibson, who does some bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: She largely works on human DNA and things
like that, but she's done a few clever
[SPEAKER_01]: tricks for me with the bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rachel, who I was lucky enough to meet
just after she published some work on
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant, and we struck up some ideas
about what to follow up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would we study domestication and
why would we study eggplants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, domestication is, I think,
a really interesting model to study
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works really well for a few
reasons, and these are just some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons I've come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So firstly, if we don't know what the
progenitors are, at least we can know that
[SPEAKER_01]: they will be extant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not looking at speciation over
millions of years where various species
[SPEAKER_01]: have gone extinct at any point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We largely know what traits were involved,
so we can zoom in on these rather easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to be things like shattering,
fruit shape, fruit size, taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: colors, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's recent and it's rapid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we haven't got millions of years
of evolution to try and decipher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just got a few thousand years of
very strong selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of cases, we have parallel
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So studying one crop, you can often
piggyback off some of the ideas from other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting to study
whether parallel evolution has occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, if crop A has lost
the ability to shatter its seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe crop B has in the same genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very quick to zoom in on those
potential candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there is the money side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to know where our
food comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't about farm to fork,
that sort of thing, but more about where
[SPEAKER_01]: the species came from, how they
originated, which traits were involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what genes were involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we think about climate change and
food security, we're going to have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more food from less land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can know more about the genes
involved in yield and abiotic and biotic
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerances, that's exactly what we need at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why eggplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, firstly, I think it's just generally
a really interesting crop in and of
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got here on the right a picture of a
wild eggplant and obviously a domesticated
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wild eggplant fruits are only a couple
of centimeters in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can probably see there that
there's thorns all over there and the
[SPEAKER_01]: calyx and the stems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gone quite a long way in
evolutionary terms to get from the
[SPEAKER_01]: small-fruited, very bitter-tasting wild
eggplant to the very large, purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more mild-tasting eggplants that we
would cook ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think eggplant is interesting in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's in the Solanaceae,
it's related to several other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got tomatoes, tomatoes, however you
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how I was going to pronounce
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, chilies,
and even tobacco as well is in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some of the traits and for some of
the crops, there's definite parallels in
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruit size and fruit color and fruit shape
are some of the obvious ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also got changes in plant
architecture and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tomato research tends to be a
little bit further ahead, the eggplant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's largely because more people eat
more tomatoes, than they do eggplants,
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to the money side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in eggplant, we can piggyback to a
certain degree on some of the work that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been done in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to highlight this parallel
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got here a table from a paper
that's almost 20 years old now doing QTL
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping in eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some significant crossover
in the QTLs found in eggplants as there
[SPEAKER_01]: was found in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is based on the same genomic
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, we don't know if the
same genes are involved, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably good evidence that at least
there's some parallels for things like
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit weight, fruit shape, anthocyanins,
and a stripe on some of the tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the eggplants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really nice study system for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we already know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started this project in about 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before this, there was a bit of
phylogenetic work looking at the origins
[SPEAKER_01]: of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this map on the left shows how the
different taxa and subspecies,
[SPEAKER_01]: however you want to call it, are related
to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Africa, we have a range of wild
eggplants, and it's thought that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: transport to sort of China and India from
the north of the range in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the domestication
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's shown by the yellow star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gave rise to the sort of
primitive small-fruited eggplants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then went on to be domesticated into
the large-fruited eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also from these small-fruited
eggplants, we have got regression
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially back into being weedy forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wild eggplant is often seen as a weed
in farmers' fields and potentially this is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually derived from the primitive
domesticates as opposed to being
[SPEAKER_01]: undomesticated true wild eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rachel Meyer, as I said before,
I've had a lot of contact with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did a lot of work looking at
domesticated eggplants and hypothesized
[SPEAKER_01]: more than one origin of the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she found significant differences
between a sort of Western and an Eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So separated into India, Nepal,
Pakistan versus Thailand, Burma,
[SPEAKER_01]: places like that, with a potential third
origin in the Philippines or Malaysia in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Southeast there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first paper that I talked about
didn't suggest any more than one origin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the second paper I've just talked
about potentially two or even three
[SPEAKER_01]: origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only have we got parallel
domestication of tomatoes and eggplants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we might have parallel domestication
of different groups of eggplants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why and how have these crops been
domesticated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've already said about the fruit
size and that's one of the dead giveaways
[SPEAKER_01]: that differ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got here in the center, I've got a
picture of a small part of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a lot of spines in the top
photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the wild eggplant,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got these one to two centimeter long
spines on the leaves, the stems and the
[SPEAKER_01]: calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas domesticated plants, 99 times out
of 100, they don't have the spines at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right here, I've just got a
zoomed in photo to show you these spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always apologize to the
undergraduates who are coming to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: me if they end up on an eggplant project,
because unless they're solely working on
[SPEAKER_01]: the domesticates, they may well end up
with scratches all down the back of their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands when they're harvesting moving
plants and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like every eggplant looks the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're walking around the
supermarkets, you're probably going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: purple eggplants that are about eight
inches long and they'll all fit through a
[SPEAKER_01]: hole in the machine and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll all be very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is some of the diversity that you
can find in the landrace eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from the couple of red individuals
in the middle, these are all the same
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all Salelum melongina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got massive differences in sizes,
shapes, got colors ranging from almost
[SPEAKER_01]: whitish to green through to yellow and
purples and almost reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got long thin eggplants, short fat round
eggplants, everything in between as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's super diverse compared to what a
lot of people might expect from a
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticated species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to know was using more
up-to-date techniques, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: revisit the multiple domestications
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was there one or more than one
domestication of eggplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to look into a couple of specific
aspects of the taxonomy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two main things I wanted to
investigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So firstly, we've got this potential for
feral eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are the weedy eggplants that are found
in farmer's field actually derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: the domesticated and then they've sort of
been rewilded?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they just wild eggplants
pre-domestication, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a group of cultivars
which have been either called subspecies
[SPEAKER_01]: avidurum or Salelum avidurum on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And avidurum obviously is sort of egg
shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have fruits that are about the
size of a chicken's egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not very large at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some taxonomists have said that this
is a separate species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others have said they're just primitive
domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And others have said that they're a
specific group of domesticates that humans
[SPEAKER_01]: have selected on since the domestication
of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a few hypotheses to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to use more sort of genomic
scale markers to investigate this,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the research prior to this was
either looking at three or four nuclear
[SPEAKER_01]: genes or chloroplast gene sequences,
or they were using AFLPs and a mixture of
[SPEAKER_01]: AFLPs and ITS sequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is genotyping by
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Margaret can attest, the genome of
eggplant is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not huge, but it's not manageable
when we were starting up the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did genotyping by sequencing of 95
accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This demography work has been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put a link there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to get a mixture of all the
different gene samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got wild eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got selenium ovidurum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that's primitive or whether
that's derived, we wanted to investigate
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at land races from
throughout Indochina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost everywhere where the land races
are grown in quite large amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: we looked at those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed away from the sort of highly
inbred cultivars, because I think for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cultivars, there's a reasonable
chance of them being transported all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, strange hybrids being produced
that may have different qualities that the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a good chance that any GBS data
we got from these plants would just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't necessarily be reliable as to
the origin of that land race in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stuck to the land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't look at the improved varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: After doing the GBS, we ended up with
nearly 5,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some phylogenetic genetics,
and we looked at the population structure
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, trying to address these
questions about where and when or where
[SPEAKER_01]: and how many times the eggplant was
domesticated, and these questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: the taxonomy as well that were previously
only hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a phylogenetic tree of the SNP
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've broken it down into three red
boxes, and I'm going to talk about them
[SPEAKER_01]: separately on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right, we've got structure
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk too much about
those, but you can see there does seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be population structure being pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the legend's at the bottom,
but the legend will be on all the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got outgroups in black.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got selenium insarnum, so that's the
wild progenitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in light blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three geographic groups of cultivars,
selenium melongina, and purple is the
[SPEAKER_01]: selenium avigerum, the egg-shaped fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the wild, so we pulled out a
reasonable amount of phylogenetic
[SPEAKER_01]: structure in terms of the wild species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in blue, we've got selenium insarnum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our progenitor species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got three other species
that came out in monophyletic groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lichtensteinii lineanum and incarnum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first two are found only in
Africa, and the third, selenium incarnum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does get confusing because we've
got an incarnum and an insarnum,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are clearly different based on
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But incarnum is found in very North Africa
moving into the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is possibly where the wild
progenitor was actually derived from,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that seems to match our phylogenetic
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to note within insarnum,
there seems to be two separate groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you see my mouse,
but I'm pointing to it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Margaret nodding, so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of two groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two accessions are from India,
and then these accessions are a mixture
[SPEAKER_01]: from more like Thailand, Vietnam,
Philippines, and Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like in the wild progenitor,
there's two quite different genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, and it looks like the domesticated
eggplant is domesticated in the East.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,
that sort of area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we've got this sort of slightly
messy group in the phylogeny where,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it's not even a group, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the sort of thing that no one likes
to see in a phylogeny because it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to say what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've called this a gradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're moving from very wild-like
genetically and phenotypically plants up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the kind of almost looking
domesticated type plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where almost all of the
avigerum fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the purple dots is about nine or
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pretty much all fall out in this
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does suggest that avigerum is a
primitive domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did some approximate Bayesian
computation, so testing different
[SPEAKER_01]: phylogenetic hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually looks like this group,
they may be partly because of gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may be some hybridization going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't necessarily just primitive
domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be kind of primitive,
but with gene flow from other
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a bit messy in terms of their
genomes, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we can safely say they're not
a derived group, like a single derived
[SPEAKER_01]: group from the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of other things in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got things that appear to be wild
and things that appear to be land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely this gradation
between true wild and land race,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, in eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because geographically they do
overlap, I think it's reasonable to expect
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is some gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been work measuring gene
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are domesticated alleles found
in wild populations in some parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: India.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly, based on previous
hypotheses, I don't think we can say this
[SPEAKER_01]: is unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to be that there's some gene
flow messing up any sort of clear genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: groupings here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we move into the domesticated
groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see there's mainly two groups
within the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top, we've got almost all the
Indian accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom, we've got Southeast
Asia, so the mainland Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the Malay Peninsula,
Philippines, and places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does look like a single origin in or
around Malaysia or Vietnam or Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these sort of two genetic groups
within the cultivated, a more Western
[SPEAKER_01]: group into India and Pakistan,
and a more Eastern group where we think
[SPEAKER_01]: the domestication took place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just two things to highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing to highlight, twice,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both of these groups, we've got plants
that look wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are actually, these four
accessions are all ones that were called
[SPEAKER_01]: feral eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it does seem to show us is that
these feral weedy eggplants that are found
[SPEAKER_01]: in farmers' fields, they do seem to be
derived from the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that kind of answers that
question about where they came from and
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they are just true wilds,
which I'd say no, they're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether they're derived from the
domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we did the ABC, the approximate
basing computation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the most likely origin of these
is through hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're potentially domesticates that
have escaped cultivation and have ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridizing with wild eggplants and ended
up with this sort of hybrid genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But largely, this tells us that the feral,
they're not true wilds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do seem to be derived from the
domesticates, or at least a portion of
[SPEAKER_01]: their genomes seem to be domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just summing that up, so in terms of
the demography and where and when all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things happened, it looks like we
have a single domestication in Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selenium ovidurum seems to be a primitive
domesticate, but there is some level of
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridization and admixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the phenotypically wild
eggplants do seem to be derived from the
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticates, but they may be derived with
some other ongoing gene flow as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something else we wanted to look at was
genes under selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said before, this is quite often
one of the targets of a domestication
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do this, we did RNAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we did the GBS, the genotyping by
sequencing, these are random loci from
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the chances of more than a few
percents of those ending up in genes is
[SPEAKER_01]: very slim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to do was actually try
and zoom in on genes that may have been
[SPEAKER_01]: under selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sequenced transcriptomes,
which are generally a lot smaller than a
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily easier to assemble,
but at least you know that the reads you
[SPEAKER_01]: get are from coding regions by and large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this study, I'm going to talk about
28 individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did sequence some more, but when we
sorted out all the phylogenetic work,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of our individuals seemed to be
admixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've avoided those in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this story, but we've still got the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at the wild egg plant,
which is Insanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only ended up sequencing four of those
because some of the wilds ended up being
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid-y, and we tried to ignore those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got three of another wild species in
Carnum, which we think is the progenitor
[SPEAKER_01]: of Insanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at six of Ovidurum, that's the
one with the egg-shaped fruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 15 Melongener the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked only at land races again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at leaves because if you
imagine comparing the transcriptomes of
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit, you've got very large, very small,
green, yellow, red fruits and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you look at the seedlings and
you look at the leaves, they're much more
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're not doing is enriching for
things that just happen to be because the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit is larger, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just pull out loads of genes
involved in fruit enlargement,
[SPEAKER_01]: which may or may not have been under
selection during domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so this is how it's broken
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we did, we measured
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about a 50% drop in diversity
during eggplant domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, 47%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So comparing Insanum to Ovidurum,
so this is going from wild to primitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 47% reduction in
nucleotide diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got another small drop as
we get from Ovidurum into the domesticates
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this fits all our hypotheses about how
domestication works in that the cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: or the land races we're looking at today
tend to have a subset of the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variation present in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given that we only sampled four
Insanum and 15 domesticers, this seems
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty substantial drop as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found several fixed differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are potential for these genes to
be involved in domestication phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 1400 during domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a very small number of fixed
differences between Ovidurum and the land
[SPEAKER_01]: races.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you imagine that there are fixed
differences in alleles at the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in pathogen resistance,
that absolutely makes sense that there may
[SPEAKER_01]: be different pathogens in the different
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it may be to do with fruit size,
fruit shape, plant stature, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this amount of drop of diversity is
nothing untoward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually fits fairly in the middle of
other other findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maize and soybean, the genetic
bottleneck is probably less than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in rice and common bean is probably
the bottleneck is probably stronger than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eggplant fits in the middle of all of
those crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find quite low diversity overall,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the wild progenitor, almost a
quarter of the low cycle monomorphic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, we are zooming in on only
coding regions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no non-coding regions involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, diversity is lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found almost a third of the loci in
the land races were monomorphic as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does lead us to a slight problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to do was look at
dropping nucleotide diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compare the nucleotide diversity for
every locus where we had enough
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare the nucleotide diversity in the
wild and the nucleotide diversity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we see a significant drop,
then we can presume that this locus was
[SPEAKER_01]: under selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that a third of the loci
are monomorphic in the domesticates
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we actually run tests like this,
everything is monomorphic in the
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, all we're finding is the
genes that have the highest variation in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily correspond to those
that have had the greatest drop in
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity because they've all got no
diversity at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did follow up on this by doing some
genome-wide work, which I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because this is transcriptomes and we
sequenced all the plants on the same day
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time, they were all grown in
the same ways, we could examine expression
[SPEAKER_01]: divergence too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you about two
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So comparing the wild to the land races
and comparing the wild to the primitive
[SPEAKER_01]: avidurum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the other comparisons as well,
but I don't really need to go into all the
[SPEAKER_01]: details here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So comparison A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going from wild up to all the
domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found almost, well, over 2,000 loci
were differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was quite interesting was that
the majority of these were either
[SPEAKER_01]: downregulated or silenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't a 50-50 mix of up and down
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were almost all downregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we compared, when we compared
insinum and avidurum, we had almost 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: differentially expressed loci.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the large number were
downregulated or silenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this makes me think is that if
domestication involved gene knockouts,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what our data seems to suggest
for eggplant, this could certainly make
[SPEAKER_01]: things like neo-domestication easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the easiest way to get from a
small fruit to a large fruit is to knock
[SPEAKER_01]: out three genes, you can pay someone to
run CRISPR now and knock out three genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potentially, domestication of other
crops or improvement of more primitive
[SPEAKER_01]: crops or less well-studied, less improved
crops, it could be relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's still CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work first time,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some work here by Lemon et al,
where they looked at a wild solanaceae,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they knocked out some tomato
domestication genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've also tried to re-domesticate
tomato as well by knocking out
[SPEAKER_01]: domestication genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is quite interesting, I think,
that the majority of genes, at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant, were downregulated or silenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with CRISPR, you can go in and just
knock out genes essentially as and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is quite interesting with
potential for food security and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at all our differentially
expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we measured FST, so a measure of
genetic divergence, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: relative genetic divergence, between the
different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's three comparisons shown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've separated them into
differentially expressed, which is DE,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, and not differentially
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see in all of the comparisons,
the differentially expressed genes have a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater relative divergence between the
populations than the non-differentially
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this tells us that there is a signature
of selection at the nucleotide level
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've got an increase in
divergence between the two populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So humans have selected for possibly an
allele that's differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, that's increased the
amount of nucleotide diversity between the
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So selecting on one allele out of the
dozens that might be present would
[SPEAKER_01]: increase your genetic divergence as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this follows our sort of hypotheses
about how human selection may be working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we were interested in what
these genes were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've named a few here, but we ran a Go
analysis as well just to see if there was
[SPEAKER_01]: any categories of genes that came out as
differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some quite interesting Go terms
that do fit what we know about
[SPEAKER_01]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got terms involved in defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely, this was due to biotic defense,
but there was some abiotic tolerance in
[SPEAKER_01]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got jasmonic acid biosynthesis,
jasmonic acid being a plant hormone,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's involved in growth and things like
that, and photoperiodism and flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's a reasonable chance
that domestication involves selection on
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering because farmers will want a
field of eggplants that are flowering and
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting at approximately the same time,
rather than what might happen in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a farmer having to go out and pick a
few eggplants every day for three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these Go terms do make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just zooming in on a couple of genes,
this is a couple to do with fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, and that makes sense because
humans would have probably selected on
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also two genes here,
gigantea and early flowering three,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've been shown in Arabidopsis to
be involved in photoperiodism and
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two genes actually directly
interact, at least in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is quite a nice little story that
we're doing a bit more work on this now,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get a bit more information about
where and when these genes are being
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed and how that differs between a
wild and a domesticated eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take a breath now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, when we tried to look
at nucleotide diversity on a gene-by-gene
[SPEAKER_01]: basis, we'd got so many monomorphic loci
in the eggplant that any tests on a
[SPEAKER_01]: gene-by-gene basis were simply pulling out
high diversity in the wild genes as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to candidate domestication genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But towards the end of Anna's PhD,
there was a new version of the eggplant
[SPEAKER_01]: genome came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the old version was quite highly
fragmented, and we didn't try and do
[SPEAKER_01]: genome-guided transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But later on, this better more contiguous
genome was released.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is we mapped the RNAseq
reads to the genome, and we used this to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for not individual loci that may have
been under selection, but actually chunks
[SPEAKER_01]: of the genome which contain multiple loci
with a signature of selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did this by calculating FST,
which is what I mentioned on a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: slides previously, where it's looking at
divergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high FST between a wild and a
domesticated population does suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: adaptive divergence or the influence of
human selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we measured pi, as well, which is
nucleotide diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did it over chunks of the genome of
450 kb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we think that LD drops off fairly
low within about 450 kb, although we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have great data for that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to pick a window size,
and this fitted, and it was functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to highlight, so this is not
eggplant data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there's a region of the genome
with this very strong selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've shown you by this red box,
we might expect pi to be significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: lower than the rest of the genome,
because we've lost genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: through a selective sweep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might expect FST to be higher than
the genome average, because we've got more
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between the wild and the
domesticated, as expected based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is an eggplant data.
[SPEAKER_01]: However this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all the chromosomes stacked up
from chromosome 1 to 12 going left to
[SPEAKER_01]: right, alternating between gray and black,
gray and black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got FST at the top and pi at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pi is actually getting higher as you
go further down.
[SPEAKER_01]: FST, obviously, getting higher the further
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're looking for is regions of
high FST and low pi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've highlighted three of those
regions that came out which had both a
[SPEAKER_01]: high FST and a low pi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on three different chromosomes,
and each is about four to six megabases
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at them, we've got the
region sizes, sorry, they're between about
[SPEAKER_01]: six and eight megabases long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one has several hundred genes in,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we haven't got transcriptomics
from very, very large numbers of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't really zoom in on very small
windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not saying that there's one gene
in each of these three loci that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got over a thousand genes to follow
up, which is nearly 4% of the eggplant
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite a lot for us to follow up
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did do some go analysis,
and there was an over-representation of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes involved in photosynthesis,
in the biosynthesis of the photosystems,
[SPEAKER_01]: in chlorophyll, and in the chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not the same as we found with
the RNA-seq differential expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does seem to make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That humans may have selected on higher
productivity, and chances are that
[SPEAKER_01]: involves some regulation of
photosynthesis, chlorophyll, chloroplasts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just based on three regions of
the genome and several hundred genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a bit more to follow up on
before we can say specifically what genes
[SPEAKER_01]: we think are key to the transition from
wild to domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have done is zoomed in on one
particular trait, which is this spininess
[SPEAKER_01]: that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left here, I've got a wild and a
domesticated eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't the true wild progenitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a species called Liniana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom, we've got the leaves,
and they're actually switched around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the domesticated leaf is on the left,
with the wild leaf on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the paper I mentioned from 2002,
they did a QTL mapping population crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: these two species and generating an F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at a number of different
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at fruit size, fruit shape,
fruit color.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at aspects of leaf morphology,
sizes, shapes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did also look at spininess as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said before, that's one of the
conspicuous differences between wild
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplants and domesticated eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the eggplant is in a clade
called the spiny selenums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just the wild progenitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's spiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the eggplants in this group
are spiny eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, what we wanted to do was follow
up on this and look at it in a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the QTL map that we were working
with on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite a large chunk of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right, this is just slightly
more updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking at the same traits,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's looking at the population grown
in different environments now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you'll notice is that all the
different prickles of the phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_01]: were mentioned, a lot of them stack up in
this one region of chromosome 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got spines on the stem,
the leaves, the PTLs, and the fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all stack up in one region of the
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though there are smaller QTL all
over the genome, there is this one region
[SPEAKER_01]: of the genome that corresponds to a
relatively large amount of the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked to Marie-Christine Dornet,
who is at INRA in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's been selfing this F2 population
to generate rills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is we got some rills from
her, and we got some original F2s as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: seed from the F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did some genotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things we realized
was that there's basically a binary switch
[SPEAKER_01]: between presence and absence of spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it maps to this region of chromosome
6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other QTL all correspond to the
size of the spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to have the wild allele at
this QTL from eggplant chromosome 6 to
[SPEAKER_01]: have any spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then multiple QTL around the genome
will give rise to larger or smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were doing is we wanted to zoom
in on this sort of binary switch almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started out with a 7-megabase
region, which is largely based on this
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it's useful having
multiple crops, because some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: markers are only found in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tomato chromosome 6 and the
eggplant chromosome 6, apart from a region
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top which has been flipped,
they're largely collinear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could use data from tomato and the
data from the eggplant genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we figured out this was approximately a
7-megabase window.
[SPEAKER_01]: We generated 120 plants that segregated 3
to 1 spiny to non-spiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said before, it looks like there's
a Mendelian locus controlling presence,
[SPEAKER_01]: absence of spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within the spiny plants,
there's a gradation from very small couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of millimeter spines up to the sort of one
and a half centimeter spines that scratch
[SPEAKER_01]: the skin on the back of your hand when you
get near to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to do was zoom in on
this 7-megabase region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we generated some transcriptomes from
Linianum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we mapped those to the eggplant
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just simply looked for indel
markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had undergraduates in the lab
who were scoring indel markers in these
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 14 markers in the 7-megabase
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've zoomed in on about 2 megabases
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2 megabases is a sizable chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still got a couple of hundred genes
in it, we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have narrowed it down a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only looking at 120 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think, based on those 120,
I don't think it's worth us throwing any
[SPEAKER_01]: more markers at it because we haven't got
enough recombination in that area of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did do is we collected some
plants that were, well, we collected the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit from some heterozygous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from one of those, we've got about
1,000 seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from another couple of plants,
we've got several hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do now is grow up the large
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Margaret will attest, an eggplant is a
pretty sizable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so growing up 1,000 plants is no mean
feat.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can tell whether the plants
are spiny or not spiny when they're only
[SPEAKER_01]: about two or three months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only six inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something we need, obviously,
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need someone to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that we're going to
start next year, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, we generated lineanum
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did is we did six
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did three from the spines and three
from the veins because the spines on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves are formed out of the veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to do was look at
differential expression between
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially a spine, which is an elongated
bit of a vein, and another piece of vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, we did it for three
different lineanum plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did differential expression to look at
the genes that might be involved in this
[SPEAKER_01]: trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the sort of typical plot you
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly, we've got a separation of the
three veins on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry, the three veins on the left and
the three spines on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all our differentially
expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they fall out in two main clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got high expression in the veins,
low expression in the spines, or vice
[SPEAKER_01]: versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, we can't really say
whether it might be a knockout or an
[SPEAKER_01]: upregulation or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found about 0.6% of transcripts for DE.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a small number, which is easier
to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 50 of these fell out in this two
megabase region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we secretly wanted was one
or two genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that two megabase region to also be
differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, we've got about 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them we can follow up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few interesting candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's genes involved in the modification
of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you've got cell walls being
elongated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other genes that may or may not be
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bunch of other genes as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not ready to say we've got one or
even five or even 20 candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have got enough data that we've got
things to zoom in on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think once we grow up our larger
mapping population, hopefully we can zoom
[SPEAKER_01]: in on a smaller region of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a bit more to sort of
we can bring together our data a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better to compare the differential
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at where they map and ideally
finding potentially differentially
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed genes in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we don't know it's differentially
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be a polymorphism that
changes the coding sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got no a priori reason to think it's
differential expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's a different place to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just recently there was a selenium
lineanum genome released.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the most high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've mapped it back to the
domesticated eggplant genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've now very easily we can go in
and design hundreds of molecular markers
[SPEAKER_01]: just for this small region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need time and we need a bit of
space to get on with this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're quite happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're quite enjoying this at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had various people working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we seem to be getting closer anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to sum up, I think I'm about 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got an interesting and a
convoluted domestication of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got post-domestication gene flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a lot of overlap between
where these land races are grown and where
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild eggplants are found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got escape from domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got quite an interesting
potential evolutionary story about
[SPEAKER_01]: de-domestication and whether you get how
this kind of reversal of the domestication
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome comes about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a lot to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun time to be working on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's this sort of
giant Excel sheets and R documents with
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of different things in that we
need to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do seem to be getting closer at
least to this one trait that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are sort of zooming in on it right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to acknowledge people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Anna was the PhD student who did a lot
of the demography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jane helped us out with some of the more
tricky bioinformatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rachel she supplied us with some seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she may have illegally sent it to
us through the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we threw the plants away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't grow it in our own gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few undergraduates and master's
students working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many to name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of those undergraduates have
been trawling through the Indale PCR and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A special thanks to Mary Christine
Dornier-Inra because she didn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: supply the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she has been maintaining these
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's obviously supplied a lot to
Margaret as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's still involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's still interested, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had funding from the university when I
got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an annual adventures grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank Margaret as well for the
invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really interesting to talk to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks Cornell as well for hosting as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd obviously be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I presume that's where we're going next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mark, for a wonderful seminar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to the Zoom gods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for a smooth connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 5,000 miles away and no Zoom
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either type in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can just unmute yourself and ask
your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see there is a question here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Developmentally, how do the spines form?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the absence of spines due to a
failure of specification?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think once we get closer to
knowing what the candidate gene might be
[SPEAKER_01]: or what the sort of presence absence gene
might be, I think that's going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do seem to just grow out of the
veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say exactly what tissues or
exactly what cell types are involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to do a bit of work on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been talking to people about doing
electron microscopy of the developing
[SPEAKER_01]: spine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a conversation that started
about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, we all know what happened
about nine months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's put on hold for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we would like to know a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it will help us find candidate
genes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we know it's an elongation of the
cell wall or if we know it's a breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: in some compound that would normally
constrain the cell wall, we can start
[SPEAKER_01]: zooming in on that, whether it's lignin or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But developmentally, they don't seem to be
the same as trichomes in tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a bit disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, if it was the same
developmentally, we've got candidate genes
[SPEAKER_01]: we can start looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think we can do that because
they don't seem to be developmentally the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as a trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're multicellular, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're multicellular, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrian, the professor who asked the
question, works on live cell imaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a great system to do live
imaging on.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question from Jeff Doyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you working on more of the messy gene
flow issues using network methods,
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have actually been doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, we've got a project on
brassicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the postdoc who's working on that,
she's now getting very adept at all these
[SPEAKER_01]: network type, doing gene-based phylogenies
and putting them together to make networks
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we are following up with that,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was published over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, we've got a lot of the
brassica data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out brassica is a real mess
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, the postdoc is probably going
to apply some of their skills to this
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Hamid has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask him to unmute himself for his,
because it's a two-part, if he's OK with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in those feral weedy
species that you identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that their F1 hybrids are
really close to the hybridization event,
[SPEAKER_02]: and thus exhibiting hybrid vigor,
and that helps them be successful as weedy
[SPEAKER_02]: species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more of a situation where they've
hybridized several generations ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then found them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think these are sort of early
generation hybrids that are super
[SPEAKER_01]: heterotic and then just manage to live
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a bit of work which we couldn't
really conclude much from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hesitant to talk about it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take this all with a pinch of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did is we looked in these
feral.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some transcriptomes from the
ferals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like a non-insignificant
proportion of the loci that are
[SPEAKER_01]: introgressed do seem to be candidates for
being under selection during
[SPEAKER_01]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a largely domesticated
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bit that's introgressed seems to
be enriched.
[SPEAKER_01]: For genes that may have been under
selection during domestication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be spiny genes, dwarfing genes,
small fruit genes that have introgressed
[SPEAKER_01]: into the domesticates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got a long way to go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pinch of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamid, are you OK asking your questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great talk, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Hamid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, you mentioned that Ovijerov has
gene flow with the cultivated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wonder if you have tested for gene
flow with the wild ancestor also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try and think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's entirely probable that that
has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I remember, that wasn't one of
our scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we tested that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't really comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there is a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was also wondering whether the fruit
phenotypes are diverse in Ovijerov,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do they all have egg-shaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everything that's called Ovijerov is
based on having these egg-shaped fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenotypically, they are all very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some sort of yellowish fruits and
some very bright white fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because there's so much diversity,
there's long and short and fat and round
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everything has just been named
Ovijerov that looks about like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our phylogeny, even though they're
all in that gradation, I think there's two
[SPEAKER_01]: Ovijerov accessions that are in the
domesticus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like they may be independently
derived egg-shaped fruit cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're found in very
different places in the phylogeny and very
[SPEAKER_01]: different from where the other Ovijerovs
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have one more question from Jim
Givanoni.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given the presence, the absence that
phenotype finds, Jim's wondering if you
[SPEAKER_02]: might expect something other than a cell
wall candidate, for example, a
[SPEAKER_02]: transcription factor or kinase or some
other kind of master regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps you could take your mapping
region and compare it to a non-spiny
[SPEAKER_02]: relative, like tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, so I've got a PhD student
starting after Christmas who is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be zooming in on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to use as much data as we
can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got one of the Linianum genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all the transcriptomes that
we've generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a small number of domesticated
genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got things like tomatoes
and even potatoes if we want to go that
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'd like to do is try and throw
together as much data as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you mentioned kinases
because in that region of the genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a few kinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that kinases are very broad topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very specific or a broad category
of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does seem to be a cluster of
kinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be entirely circumspect and
nothing to do with spines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does seem that there is a cluster
of kinases in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite ready yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are no more questions,
join me in thanking Mark for a wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And TGI Friday, Mark, you're done with
your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I've got to talk to some PhD
students now, apparently, in about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, PhD students, join Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not off the hook yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
