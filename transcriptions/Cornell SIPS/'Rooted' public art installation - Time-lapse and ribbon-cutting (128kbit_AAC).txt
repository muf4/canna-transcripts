[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everyone, and it really is
a pleasure to see you here this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some formal remarks, but I've
decided that it's too beautiful a day to
[SPEAKER_02]: stick to a script, so I hope you're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: With my taking a little bit of freedom
here to talk about this wonderful project
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're about to see unhurled this
afternoon, and the importance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: concept of being rooted, and how important
that concept is, not only to our faculty
[SPEAKER_02]: and our staff, but certainly to our
students, that they feel that they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: home here at Cornell, and that they feel
that all that has led them to come to be
[SPEAKER_02]: here at Cornell is part of being rooted,
rooted in who they are and who they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be, and that Cornell plays an
important role in that process of becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: who you are and who you are going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would like to thank Justin Conrad,
who's a wonderful genius it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: to create this beautiful exhibit today,
to Martian Julie, who makes it all
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, and to all of those in
horticulture and beyond who have
[SPEAKER_02]: contributed to the the unfurling of this
beautiful exhibit here today, and now I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to turn the microphone over to Marvin
Pritz, chairman of horticulture,
[SPEAKER_02]: to say a few words.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Catherine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few prepared parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we stand at the intersection of
art and science, a symbolic junction of
[SPEAKER_00]: apprehension and perseverance,
where we display to the world a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: our collective character that many words
cannot easily express, but which one word
[SPEAKER_00]: reveals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we contemplate the planning before
us, let us take a moment to appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, fertile soil that we have in this
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the literal soil under our feet,
but the metaphorical soil that is Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University in the surrounding area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is composed of minerals, organic
matter, microorganisms, and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mineral elements of our metaphorical
soil are the geological features of this
[SPEAKER_00]: region, with its hills, lakes,
gorges, and waterfalls that surround us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lush vegetation and the bountiful
fruit, vegetables, dairy, and wildlife
[SPEAKER_00]: that we find here comprise the organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil's moisture represents the sweat
of our forebears, who risked life and
[SPEAKER_00]: limbs to sustain themselves in this place
and build an institution that is the envy
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though living soil is incomplete
without its biological component,
[SPEAKER_00]: our living Cornell soil contains thousands
of faculty and staff who care deeply about
[SPEAKER_00]: the success of students and work hard to
make this place special.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no better soil than the state of
our community anywhere else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is into this soil that we invite each
of you to establish your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sink them deeply into the medium that is
provided to you for the taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drink the moisture that is contained in
the soil, suck up the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow and develop into a beautiful
flower that brightens the world and brings
[SPEAKER_00]: joy and pleasure to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these flowers, each of us have
different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black, white, brown, Christian,
Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, gay and
[SPEAKER_00]: straight, young and old, rich and poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as this display will be all the
more beautiful from its diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and shapes, so too will this place
be richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who dare sink our roots
into the soil that we call Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move through the coming weeks of
exams, term papers, interviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: and possibly graduation, look upon rooted
with the knowledge that whatever comes our
[SPEAKER_00]: way, we will not simply cope, but we will
blossom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are strong, we are rooted, and we are
Cornellian.
Thank you.
I just want to thank everyone for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we need is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I started working with Marcia
this fall, we were thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: something that we could do that would
involve the whole campus community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really mean the word of inclusivity and
really bring joy to the students.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many past resources at Cornell
and thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the child.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am so thankful for all the
collaboration that we've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: My personal experience was only two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll graduate this May, but I am so
thankful to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you to the student bodies who
really engage with this exhibit and to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what their colors are and to continue our
roots as Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do just want to say a few words of
thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, I want to point out if you're
not aware of it, there are solar lights
[SPEAKER_01]: woven through the installation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you'll be able to enjoy it at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the day, it'll be colors of pale
white and yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at night, it'll be red and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few people to thank.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the beginning, we've had so many
people involved with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Miller provided bulb expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had people that range from the LGBTQ
community to the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Horticulture planting the 13,000 bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin was the one who was the creative
influence who got so excited and started
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the clock tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really didn't believe that that
could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's sacred turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe they let us do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the grounds department and Gannett
Health Services involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want to make sure that we thank
the people who capture this forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig Kramer, Jason Koski are taking
images that will allow us to enjoy this
[SPEAKER_01]: for always and not just for the two weeks
that the installation will be in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, I think I've acknowledged
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to say, I mean this
seriously, this could only happen at this
[SPEAKER_01]: university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that other places wouldn't
recognize the value of public art as a
[SPEAKER_01]: means to inspire and inform, not just to
be pretty, but to have a message and to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry a message to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're so grateful that our
administration sees this as an important
[SPEAKER_01]: gesture and not just a pretty one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without their support, we certainly
wouldn't have the opportunity to play and
[SPEAKER_01]: express ourselves in this particular way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always tricky when you start thanking
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the danger of leaving someone out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I mentioned everywhere there have
been a lot of people involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grounds crew, the grounds department,
the grounds department and the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: staff helped us out a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you enjoy it as it continues to
change over the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it will burn in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that the pots will exclude the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we pull them up in two weeks,
you'll still be able to see the pattern
[SPEAKER_01]: and that'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming out and we hope you
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our formal ribbon cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Marsha.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you go on up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank
you.
Bravo.
