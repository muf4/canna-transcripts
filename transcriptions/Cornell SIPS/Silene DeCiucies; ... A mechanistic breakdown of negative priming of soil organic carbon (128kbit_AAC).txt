[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Celine De Soucis and
today I will be talking to you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms behind negative priming of soil
organic carbon by pyrogenic organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we're going to start off with the
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really changing scales and topics
here from our last talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a lot smaller and so why are
we concerned about these interactions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one why is that pyrogenic
organic matter is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in recent history it's been touted as
this exciting new agricultural amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: this magic bullet, but it's also been
added to our soil for hundreds of years or
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years throughout human
history through cook fires, burn pits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more importantly it's been added to
the soil through natural events like
[SPEAKER_00]: forest fires, lightning strikes for
hundreds of thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stuff is ubiquitous in soils and
we now know that it has a profound,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has profound interactions between
itself and the soil organic carbon that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impacting the soil organic carbon
and in recent work in our lab we have
[SPEAKER_00]: found some, it's been found that this
could have long-term implications for
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon is there, it's interacting with
the carbon that we know and care about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and today we're going to kind of pull
apart these interactions and break them
[SPEAKER_00]: down to a mechanistic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So priming is a way of priming the soil
organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a word I'm going to be using a lot
today and it's used differently throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature, but in relation to my work
the priming of soil organic carbon by pyOM
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically describing a change in
mineralization rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you add pyOM to soil organic
carbon it might increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization rate, that would be
positive priming, or it may decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization rate, which would be
negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're only going to talk about
negative priming because this is what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: found in my research and this is also kind
of what's exciting in terms of long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a list of proposed mechanisms
of negative priming, kind of gotten from
[SPEAKER_00]: current literature surrounding this work,
and we're going to walk through them one
[SPEAKER_00]: by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little icons, these colorful
icons on the right are going to repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the presentation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear these words a lot,
you'll see these colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them in the upper right of
the screen, that kind of means that
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I'm talking about is related to
that mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our baseline situation over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have soil microbes, they're eating soil
carbon, they're respiring CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for their first negative priming
mechanism we have inhibition of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening here is when you add
the pyOM it basically creates a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: source for these microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of getting their nutrients
from the soil and respiring that carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get the nutrients from
the pyOM and that'll decrease their soil
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration, soil carbon respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next we have toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're adding the pyOM and it's
killing the microbes, so it's reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: their respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're adding a new substrate that the
microbes might find more tasty and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to respire as much soil
carbon, they're going to respire char
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrate dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a little bit of the
substrate switching and also a physical
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution of the soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the pyOM addition is making
it harder for those microbes to get at
[SPEAKER_00]: their tasty soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: SOC sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pyOM has a really high kind of
adsorptive potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has high surface area, charge,
and so what may be happening is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: DOC in the soil or in the soil carbon in
general is being sorbed onto the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of the char and this is protecting it from
being mineralized by microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then microbial signal sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I'm not really going
to touch on today because I haven't worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some of that in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's exciting stuff and to break it
down to its simplest form, essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps pyOM is creating a barrier between
the communication of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say one of them is saying, hey,
there's a bunch of tasty food over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and the pyOM is blocking that from getting
to their fellow microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to reduce the amount that
they're respiring that carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is kind of
facilitated aggregation in that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: add pyOM, perhaps it's increasing the
ability of that soil to make aggregates
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause physical protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of the mechanisms that
are in the literature right now and that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be kind of talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, my overarching question is
which mechanisms are responsible of that
[SPEAKER_00]: big list that we just talked about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm going to break this into a
couple different questions and topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we're going to talk about the
dilution mechanism followed by substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: switching, toxicity, and then we're going
to see kind of what's left after that and
[SPEAKER_00]: how might we parse that out once we've
gotten rid of a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our hypotheses, as I was
mentioning, we know that pyOM is very
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorptive, so we're thinking that
sorption is a really important mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that there's probably
more than one going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going at that with this
approach, kind of keeping an open mind
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout this mechanistic study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at the dilution experiment,
I set up an experiment where I'm basically
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to simulate the dilution effect
with other inert media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm adding pyOM and then I'm adding
these different media in the same volume
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've added perlite, quartz sand,
and also a carbonless soil version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this experiment, I use marden topsoil
from Mount Pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 5% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pH adjusting the char so that it
equals that of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also adding nutrients that kind of
overwhelm any nutrient effects that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would get from adding the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this experiment is really talking about
targeting the mechanisms of dilution but
[SPEAKER_00]: also substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the way that we've created
the experiment, we're able to cross off a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get rid of nutrient mining
because we're adding more nutrients than
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes could ever really need or
that they could get from that extra char.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also able to cross off pH effects
because we're pH adjusting the char so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it equals that of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, this is a pretty short
scale incubation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can kind of cross off
aggregation because that's not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time to really facilitate those
type of interactions in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide is kind of walking through
my general method of investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simplified basically like two
years of my life in one slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is I grew isotopically
labeled Willow biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a really super high 13C label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're creating pyOM out of this
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this experiment, I'm using a 450
degree char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're adding that char to the
soil and also our other amendments or
[SPEAKER_00]: other treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're wetting these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're monitoring their
respiration over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we monitor the respiration using this
fancy machine on the seventh floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the PCARO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, what this thing spits out
is a PPM CO2 respired per day and also an
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope value that corresponds with that
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with those two numbers, we're able to
throw a little bit of algebra at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically determine how much of that soil,
how much of that respiration is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil and how much is coming from
the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that calculation, we're able
to determine priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some results from that first
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see, first I'm going to explain
this chart actually because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be using these units a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the y-axis, we have cumulative soil
C respired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divided by the initial soil in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is normalizing every treatment
based on the amount of carbon that they
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also cumulative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's adding the amount of soil carbon
respired day by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see here is the black line is
the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular experiment,
we experienced negative priming for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just adding sand, completely
inert, really low surface area,
[SPEAKER_00]: media, we had some negative priming with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also see that the perlite,
maybe a little more surface area,
[SPEAKER_00]: more negative priming, followed by this
ash subsoil, contains clay, probably a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more interaction going on with that media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we have the most
negative priming with our PIO-M addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we can say about dilution is
that perhaps the dilution effect can be
[SPEAKER_00]: explained by this difference between the
control in the sand or even the control in
[SPEAKER_00]: the perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this isn't completely compensating for
the amount of negative priming that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have from our jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is another way to look at this
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of cumulative, it's looking at
daily soil carbon respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that most of this
effect, most of this negative priming,
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening rather quickly within the
first five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also on this chart, I've added the
respiration of the jar itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that this is pretty
negligible compared to the soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being respired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, what I've done is I've taken
each treatment away from the control so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can really have a look at the
magnitude of priming that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control doesn't exist in this
experiment because it's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this line is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we can see is we can see this
increasing negative priming, kind of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: language, when less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see that, yes, we have
significant negative priming with this
[SPEAKER_00]: PIO-M treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up here is the respired jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can also see that the
respiration of the jar definitely can't
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for the amount of negative
priming that we have of soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, from that experiment,
what we can say is that dilution
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely isn't the only story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither is substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to get back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both are definitely having an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exerting negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of showing us,
of all this negative priming exerted by
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar, about this much at this point can
be described by this dilution effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: this much by substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have this huge part of the pie
that's unexplained mechanistically so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now moving on, we're going to
target substrate switching as well as soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic carbon sorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next questions to get at these
new mechanisms, now that we've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed off dilution, is how can we
determine, oh, and also toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, for toxicity, how can we
determine that the char we're applying is
[SPEAKER_00]: not just killing these microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing these
interesting effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, can we make a better case for
refuting the substrate switching that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, if sorption is the striving
mechanism, kind of does it have an
[SPEAKER_00]: endpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a smaller amount of char we could
add that wouldn't have this exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: negative priming?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer these questions, I designed
an application rate experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just adding kind of different
concentrations of char to the same soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used in my last experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're adding 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5,
and 10 milligrams per gram of char to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry soil, that same 5% carbon soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to see if there's an
ideal application rate for negative
[SPEAKER_00]: priming, and also if negative priming
doesn't exist at a lower application rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: because maybe all the adsorption sites of
the char are totally used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so other factors are overwhelming this
negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of trying to see if it has
an endpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a simplified version
of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same type of figure we saw
before, cumulative soil, C-respired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see we have our control again
in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have positive priming as opposed to
the last experiment, where we only had
[SPEAKER_00]: negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you add the 1 milligram per gram
application rate, we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the rate of soil organic carbon
mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we have the higher application
rates of 5 and 10, this is decreasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to note that,
yes, char is kind of causing negative
[SPEAKER_00]: priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may not in all situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we'll kind of have
to parse out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe if it's a mechanism like
sorption, those sites are being used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more sites left to adsorb the
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have positive priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is that same kind of
figure taking away each treatment from the
[SPEAKER_00]: control to see the magnitude of priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the positive priming over here,
the negative here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to speak to the substrate
switching mechanism, which, if we can all
[SPEAKER_00]: recall, is where the microbes are eating
the char instead of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, basically, the accumulation of the
soil of the char carbon respired would
[SPEAKER_00]: describe that substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the magnitude of this
respiration is nowhere near the magnitude
[SPEAKER_00]: of our total negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can really kind of cross off
substrate switching at this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to speak to toxicity, this is kind of
the easiest way that I could think of to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of assay how microbes are doing after
being exposed to char.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fumigation extraction method
of microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I've incubated my char in my soil
for 40 days, I completed this assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is saying, this is kind of a
messy graph with huge error bars,
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically that there's no significant
differences in microbial biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: communities if we're adding char,
or pylem, or if we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at both the topsoil
and also a subsoil, so a higher carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and a lower carbon soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of say from this that
toxicity isn't really occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what this is saying over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're going to move on to what
we have left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, we're going to talk about SOC
sorption, because that seems most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: as a candidate for our negative priming
that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really neat way to look at sorption
is just creating these adsorption
[SPEAKER_00]: isotherms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken different concentrations of
DOC from the soil I used in my
[SPEAKER_00]: incubations, and I've shaken them
overnight with different media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either a 200 degree char, 450 degree
char, 750 degree char, or these two soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing here is over here,
we have desorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So below the zero line, all this DOC was
desorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing complete desorption for
this low temperature char, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: topsoil and kind of the subsoil is right
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for our higher temperature chars,
we have desorption at lower
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, adsorption at higher
concentrations for the 450 degree char,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the one I used in the experiments
I've talked about already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have almost complete adsorption
with a higher temperature char.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you increase the temperature of
pyrolysis, you're having more adsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really exciting way to look at
adsorption in situ is nanosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've labeled my char very highly with
delta-13C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using this amazing technique,
we're able to look at the char and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of carbon is sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the char by itself, so this is one
that's been unincubated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just has this super high delta-13C
value, which is indicated by this purple
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a piece of char that's been
incubated with soil for 40 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see that on the surface,
we have these modeled colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of this blue natural
abundance carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is telling us is that over
time, we are seeing adsorption of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance carbon on the surface of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't tell us what exactly we're
looking at or why this is happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's kind of a new, neat way to be
able to look at adsorption in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, in the future, this will be
kind of more quantitative science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we'll be able to make more
conclusions with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, basically, we've been
able to cross off or minimize a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: these mechanisms today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on our results, we're thinking
that SOC sorption is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a lot further to go with
things like microbial signal sorption,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that this is probably a
combination of many mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've seen today, we can kind of
compensate for part of this pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's so much left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is all that really coming from
sorption?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've basically ended the day with more
questions than we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is called research for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mechanistic approach is just,
I really love how really deeply scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of probing at the teeniest
details and being able to build further
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've really enjoyed this type of
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't be possible without my
committee, Johannes and Janice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also everyone in my lab who helped me
out, especially our amazing research
[SPEAKER_00]: technicians, and really everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This couldn't have been done without my
lab and without all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say a little about how the soil
was handled before, from the field of
[SPEAKER_02]: sorption?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can throw in a few, how did you
think about having a real lot of sorption?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil, I got it from Mount Pleasant
and kind of homogenized, took out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks and roots, and dried it out,
sieved it, and then completely dried it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've messed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of iterations of the
incubation where I've pre-incubated the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these experiments today,
I mixed them with the amendments dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: then added water right before it started,
which I found was just kind of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: tight, the tightest way to keep everything
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard when you're mixing mud
and char together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they were treated before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I have other experiments where I
have added, usually I'm adding an
[SPEAKER_00]: uncharred version of the PIO-M.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am adding biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those, we're basically seeing,
we are seeing negative priming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's mostly compensated for by this
substrate switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this huge surge in the
microbes eating that spicy, exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely different mechanisms
than with the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of like the topsoil of
Mount Pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, four and a half, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have 0.5, one, two and a half,
five, and 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on my figure, I only showed a couple
of them because the 0.5 and the two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half just kind of muddied it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, the 0.5 exerted positive
priming as well as the one, as you saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 2.5 exerted negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But neither of those were different enough
from the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of made it look a little
messy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did, I was just kind of doing some
calculations in my head of what,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think about applying 500 to
an acre of land, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 20 tons, 10 tons, two tons kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the five milligram per gram
application rate, which is the one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had, that I had on the figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would exert kind of significant
significantly different negative priming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that translates to about four tons per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four tons per hectare, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, four tons per acre, about 11 tons per
hectare.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that a lot in terms of,
I don't know what the whole thing is up
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be a large application?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be, yeah, that would be a large
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about adding compost,
a typical addition of compost is about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: tons per hectare, 10 tons per acre,
which is twice the amount of my
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has a similar bulk density or
even like much higher than the char,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really fluffy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be like, yeah, we would be
adding a significant amount of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also confusing because of the
depth of soil and like that eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: plow layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of really hard to translate it
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be like a significant
addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not a sprinkle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of what this is
saying, but we definitely need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: into that more and break that down into
especially field experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is in jars in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to extend this further.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think it should be ruled
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess for me, it wasn't as exciting
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So char has an inherently like super high
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the soils I'm looking at are
around four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that's going to have a huge
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that that's probably,
I mean, it's just kind of something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know is happening and that I didn't,
I just kind of wanted to look at different
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to try to control for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's super hard to control for
that because basically I'm adjusting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH with HCl is how I'm adjusting the pH of
the char, which maybe isn't completely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, compensating for the pH changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I was just kind of more
interested in other mechanisms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know already had a profound effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we know pH is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pH and pH and moisture are arguably
like the most important factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was kind of trying to probe beyond
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could very well be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not something that I've looked
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, we should.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced at high pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know because I've only looked
at the system with these pH adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I could, it would be pretty
easy to do these adsorption isotherms with
[SPEAKER_00]: an un-pH adjusted char to see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we're seeing in one of my first
pieces of data, a lot of this negative
[SPEAKER_00]: priming can be happening very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the scope of, you know,
a 24 or 36 hour adsorption experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how the change in charge or
pH will affect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, I mean, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that like adsorption is something
that could be happening that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would probably increase if you had
a super high pH char.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not something I can speak to
yet because I haven't tried it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering whether there is
possibility that there is a changing about
[SPEAKER_01]: the composition of the microbial
population with or without.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there definitely are changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thea, my kind of predecessor, did some
work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tara in my lab is also working with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that I've looked at
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of avoided it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
