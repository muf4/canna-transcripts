[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Lucia Vignale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a third year PhD candidate in plant
breeding and genetics here at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University in the Larry Smart Lab,
organizing our lab's annual hemp webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the seventh one this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apart from this one, we only have one
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've all been enjoying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we are focusing on hemp rain
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today's speaker is Dr. Bob Pierce,
who is joining us from Lexington in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bob, for accepting our
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all excited to hear your talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bob Pierce is an extension professor
and director of hemp programs at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Kentucky Martin Gatton
College of Agriculture, Food and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pierce grew up on a small Kentucky
farm, raising corn, soybean, hay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and barley tobacco with his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He received bachelor's and master's
degrees in agronomy from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky and a PhD in soil chemistry from
the University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: During his more than 30 years as an
extension specialist in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: he has conducted field research and
extension programming on transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: production systems, soil fertility,
conservation, tillage, methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sucker control programs for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, Dr. Pierce's hemp research
focus is in best agronomic management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, sustainability, and rotational
cropping systems for field production.
[SPEAKER_00]: He coordinates the broad hemp research
efforts for the college and assists
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers interested in hemp with
securing funding and accessing raw
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to support their research
efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that we are recording the webinar
and we've recorded all of the webinars so
[SPEAKER_00]: far, and we've uploaded them to our School
of Interpretive Hemp Science YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further ado, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate everybody for joining today
and listening to this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a slight adjustment to my title.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those things where you
agree to do something and then it's time
[SPEAKER_01]: to submit the title.
[SPEAKER_01]: You submit the first thing that pops in to
your mind and then you start preparing for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you think, well, why did I submit
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it would be a bit
premature at this stage for me to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about the best
management practices for agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: practices for grain hemp because we're
still in the process of developing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a better title for this topic is
that we're going to talk about better
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomic practices for grain hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to do that, I'm going to start by
giving just a little bit of a background
[SPEAKER_01]: of my journey with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp was not really on my radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a tobacco specialist working along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in 2014, the Farm Bill allowed states
in the US to begin conducting research on
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that, hemp was lumped in with
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all considered a schedule one
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: No research was really being done on it
out in the field, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A colleague of mine, Dr. David Williams,
stepped up to initially lead the program
[SPEAKER_01]: here at the University of Kentucky
beginning with that 2014 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there on the periphery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco had already started to decline at
that point and we knew that that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue so our tobacco growers were
looking at other options.
[SPEAKER_01]: My interest in hemp was really in trying
to find other things for our tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that they could grow and apply
their knowledge to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 2016 and 2018, I had about one
trial a year working with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say the least, my initial attempts at
growing hemp were certainly less than
[SPEAKER_01]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor stands, I had a lot of difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: When hemp came in, everybody was talking
about what an easy plant this was to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had me questioning my agronomic
abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I soon learned that a lot of us were
really struggling with just how to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: this new to us, in many cases,
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that experience, a year later,
unfortunately, Dr. Williams was diagnosed
[SPEAKER_01]: with a terminal illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and others asked me if I could step in
to take a little more part of the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became the interim director of hemp
programs and later the director of hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: programs here at the college in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really busy year for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Williams had already set up a lot of
things that were in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a visit from the then US Secretary
of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue of Senate
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitch McConnell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, with some help from Wade
Turner and our crew at the quicksand
[SPEAKER_01]: location that had been helping David
previously, we were able to get some good
[SPEAKER_01]: stands going so our politicians had a nice
backdrop for their photo op.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had multiple visits from USDA
agencies that year, from ARS and RMA and
[SPEAKER_01]: NRCS, coming to see what hemp production
was all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a massive field day, over 600
people from 25 different states in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think four or five different
countries came that year in August to view
[SPEAKER_01]: our plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: During this time, in about a four to six
month period, I went from being just on
[SPEAKER_01]: the periphery of the hemp program to being
an agronomy, hemp agronomy expert,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite a whirlwind and in the
backdrop all of this was going on was what
[SPEAKER_01]: I call the CBD Hemp Boom and Bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from about 5,000 acres of hemp in
Kentucky to 26,000 in 2019 and then back
[SPEAKER_01]: down again to about 5,000 the year after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a really, really whirlwind kind
of ride in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020, things were beginning to calm
down a little bit and of course we hit
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID, but been in the process of building
our hemp agronomy research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had a bit of research on CBD or
floral type hemp, but really have built a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of our program around grain and fiber
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to do that, had to put together a
good team of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tara was my field technician, field
manager initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Way has taken that over for the last
year or so since Tara went back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Kean, Wade Turner who I mentioned in
their crew that helped us with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalia is my lab manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manohar and Andrea, postdocs in my lab
working on seed quality, seed germination
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magdalena is a PhD candidate working
primarily on integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: and working directly with Dr. Gauchet,
whom I think you heard from earlier this
[SPEAKER_01]: year in this seminar series and also with
our entomologist, Dr. Viana Ava.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Paul Coxen is a PhD student in my
lab that is working on root growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've had a whole host of
undergraduate workers who have come
[SPEAKER_01]: through the lab in the last five years
that have been incredibly valuable in
[SPEAKER_01]: working on these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also need to take just a moment to
acknowledge our funders because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been an important part of what we've been
able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with a project from a company
called Pixis that lasted about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a couple of projects with the hemp
research consortium in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_01]: both Cornell and North Carolina State
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been very fortunate to have a good
relationship with our local USDA ARS lab
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Lexington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last couple of years have
developed a project collaborating with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant Genetic Resources Unit there in New
York as well with Zach and Tyler,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as some funding through USDA NIFA
to help keep our program going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned that I'd done a lot of back
in 2019 was doing a lot of national
[SPEAKER_01]: webinars and some things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a slide that I used quite a
bit then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to try to help folks understand what
we really didn't know at the time about
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and many of the things that we needed
to learn about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of this is still applicable
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we didn't have hardly any
information about the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the varieties or the cultivars that
we were getting at that time were
[SPEAKER_01]: generally being imported from out of the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hadn't been any breeding efforts
or anything that had taken place in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot to learn about cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, again, we were just getting
seed from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality was highly variable and not
too good in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of issues with stand
establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna talk anything about the
transplant production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was primarily work that we were doing
for plural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna concentrate more on the grain
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one, the fertility management is
honestly, when I went into this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that this is where I'm gonna
make my mark because of my training in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil chemistry and soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found out pretty quickly that if we
don't have the proper variety or cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if we can't consistently establish
stand, it's very difficult to do
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful fertility management work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to tackle some of these
other issues before we could even begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: fine tune some of our recommendations with
regards to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did have a lack of registered
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still a bit the case, although
we've got more options now than we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we still are working out some
appropriate harvest and post-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: processing methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will make some ending comments on
that this afternoon when I get there to
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also made this comment at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was when the CBD floral hemp was
going like gangbusters and growers were
[SPEAKER_01]: receiving recommendations, in some cases
not good recommendations from all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that industry was moving faster than
research was being able to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: with appropriate production practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the industry has cooled off,
we begin to get a little bit more ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: that curve, but we still got a long ways
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm primarily gonna kind of focus on
the things that my group, my lab has been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing around cultivars and seed quality
and stand establishment in hemp today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna be my focus areas for
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to gaining more knowledge
about cultivars, we are a participant and
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact coordinate the multi-state dual
purpose trial, which dual is grain and
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber as part of the S1084 USDA
multi-state project.
[SPEAKER_01]: This began in 2019 and actually David
Williams was quite instrumental in getting
[SPEAKER_01]: S1084 up and running and had already
volunteered to coordinate this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then he turned that over to me and
we have about anywhere from about 12 to
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had as many as 20 universities
participating in this project in any one
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically we select a group of 12 to
15 cultivars that go out to all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the challenges that we've had
with that is that the availability of seed
[SPEAKER_01]: changes from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping the consistent list of seeds
has been difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the owners of these cultivars
require material transfer agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's some legal barriers at
times that universities don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: agree to all of the requirements under
those or just a matter of trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody to agree on what needs to be in
those agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand establishment, you'll hear that as a
common theme throughout my talk today has
[SPEAKER_01]: been challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed pressure, not to mention the fact
that this is a rather massive and somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: messy data set when we've got all these
different participants and different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars and things like that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just point out in the picture
here, when we first started this process,
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't have a lot of funding to go with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're using a lot of hand-me-down
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an old tractor from the turf
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an old soybean cone planter that
we had modified.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 16 inch planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to get the narrow rows that
we wanted, we actually had to drive two
[SPEAKER_01]: passes over every row of plants in order
to get the row spacing that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a few challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just recently published, this just came
out in January of this year, the first
[SPEAKER_01]: three years from 2019 to 2021 of the
multi-state data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to acknowledge Dr. Zach Brim at the
University of Florida and his student,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ajit, who dove into this massive,
messy data set and did the analysis and
[SPEAKER_01]: really wrote the first draft and led that
publication effort and to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: co-authors for getting this information
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to share with you a
couple of excerpts of this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019, I don't even think we knew enough,
or we hadn't developed the program enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to request that everybody do a stand count
prior to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have data for that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for 2020 and 2021, we got some pop
plant population data at harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020, well, in 2019, everything was
planted at the same rate, just a straight
[SPEAKER_01]: number of kilograms per hectare of seed,
regardless of germination or seed size.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020, we corrected for germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, in 2021, we corrected the
seeding rates for both germination and
[SPEAKER_01]: seed size so that we were approaching a
target of about one and a half million
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, live seeds per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that, again, getting back
to our theme on stand establishment,
[SPEAKER_01]: our established stands or our harvested
stands, on average, were only about a
[SPEAKER_01]: third of that target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see across our different
locations, there was a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only had seven cultivars that were
consistently included in the trials over
[SPEAKER_01]: those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anka CFX1, Katani, and X59 were all of
Canadian origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the others were of Eastern European
origin of the cultivars that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all of these next sets of graphs,
you'll see those seven cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: our locations are color coded,
starting with kind of the dark purple and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to a lighter purple and then coming
to a light green and going to a darker
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That represents a north-south gradient,
with purple being the northernmost and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark green being the southernmost of the
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incidentally, we did have, during this
same time frame, we had locations
[SPEAKER_01]: attempted in Alabama and Louisiana,
but they never were able to get enough
[SPEAKER_01]: stands or enough yields at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be put into the data set because of
some of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at grain yields, pretty low in
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was really just kind of in a
learning mode at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020, 2021, we did a little bit better,
but you do begin to kind of notice this
[SPEAKER_01]: north-south gradient with some of the more
northern locations doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky, where these light green bars
down here at the bottom, we really
[SPEAKER_01]: struggled.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 19, we did okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some decent yields there,
but in 2020 and 2021, we were struggling
[SPEAKER_01]: with establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 21, we made some changes to our
rotation and to our planting methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: things began to improve after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, X59, CFX1, out of this group,
of cultivars tended to be the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: had the best grain yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are indicated by these solid black
dots with the arrow bars on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the overall locations,
means for those cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fiber or straw yield, again,
very low in 2019, quite variable in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: With fiber yields, you really start to see
this north-south gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the eastern European cultivars
generally, on average, were a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better, a little bit more consistent for
fiber production than CFX and X59.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned a lot from those early
seasons about which varieties are better
[SPEAKER_01]: suited to certain uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on compiling the 2022 to
2024 data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, we're already beginning to work
on a publication for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just give you a quick summary and
apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a nice pretty graph put
together yet for the 2024 data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got locations across the top here,
cultivars going down this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our cultivar averages, this is for grain
yield across all locations over here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the far right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the table, a couple of things that I'll
point out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see we have gotten a little bit
better, certainly in our locations in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky, going from some sub 500 pound
yields to approaching 1500 pound yields in
[SPEAKER_01]: this trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we all like to figure out what
Heather Darby up at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermont is doing, what our secret sauce is
for getting these kinds of yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a really good production year up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, we're seeing we've got some
cultivars like Futura 83 that are
[SPEAKER_01]: performing fairly consistently across a
large number of locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely seeing some improvements
in that variety trial program.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to fiber production,
similar thing, here we've got Ursa Alta,
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course is developed at Cornell,
being overall the best fiber producer that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had in the multi-state last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it didn't produce much seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only had seed at our grain really at
the Kentucky location, but we harvested it
[SPEAKER_01]: really late there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're beginning to amass a body of
information about at least some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different cultivars over a wide range of
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to put this up here because in
addition to the multi-state cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are these here on the left-hand side
of this graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've got our yields now
approaching 1500 pounds of raw grain per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some additional cultivars that
aren't in the multi-state trial that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were just trialing locally where we're
actually even getting better yields than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are experimental cultivar
breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested our first hybrid about two years
ago and we're getting more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids into the trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very optimistic about our
opportunities to improve yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through better cultivar selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just been a very short time
over the last four or five years and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: already beginning to see some pretty
significant improvements there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very optimistic about seeing that
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Future directions for our cultivar trials
or variety trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, we're working on publication of
the 2022 to 2024 data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to continue to evaluate these
range of cultivars across different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we've discussed as a
goal for our group is to work towards
[SPEAKER_01]: developing a system much like we have for
soybean of different maturity groups that
[SPEAKER_01]: would help in the selection of hemp
cultivars for different latitudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, we want to try to get some of
these new breeding lines and improved
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into our trials, continue to develop best
management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on refining our measurements and
evaluations, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering so we can work on developing
this grouping system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with Zach Stansel and the
phenotyping guide that they put together
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to work on our methods for
evaluating this and also refining our
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practices with regards to these different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to switch gears a little bit and
start talking more about some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: infield establishment work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to 2019, went back and got some
seed size information and germination
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the seed lots that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then went back and looked at our
population counts that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we had really good stands in
2019, but it was disappointing to look and
[SPEAKER_01]: see that we still were just hovering
around 50% establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that 50% of the live seed that we
planted resulted in a harvestable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which agronomically speaking is just not
really acceptable for a commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about corn or soybean or even
wheat, certainly your expectation is for
[SPEAKER_01]: better efficiency than that in terms of
the amount of seed planted to the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants that are harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul, my PhD student, has been taking a
closer look at some of this establishment
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at population counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had there was just counts that
were taken 14 days after we planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul did a little more intensive counts
starting at three days after planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: every two days thereafter went out and
counted the number of plants for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 days, which we kind of considered that
to be our establishment period of what was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did this for a selected group of
cultivars that were in our cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, this was in the fiber trial
in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there our best performing
cultivar in terms of establishment was
[SPEAKER_01]: Fedora 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got close to 90% of the seed that was
planted appeared to be established by the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the establishment period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a range down to about 70%
establishment for the cultivar Yuma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did our typical population counts
at harvest right before we harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that in almost all cases,
we lost a considerable number of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from the end of the establishment period
to the time of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do we have the initial
establishment, we also have this loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been something that's been pretty
consistent throughout a lot of our trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a dual purpose trial in 2023,
lower target population of 32 plants per
[SPEAKER_01]: linear meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get quite as high establishment
rate as what we did in the fiber trial,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still Fedora 17 here in the purple was
our best establishing cultivar in both
[SPEAKER_01]: trials that particular year did very well
for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we see that there was between the
end of establishment and in the harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: period, we are continuing to lose some
plants along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm going to go back to this one and
you'll notice that this was in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: These cultivars, we were approaching 20 to
maybe 25 plants per linear meter relative
[SPEAKER_01]: to our target of 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2024, same cultivars, same planting
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planted about two weeks later because we
had had some wet weather and then we got
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see our establishment was much
less in 2024 under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have irrigation that we were
applying, so it wasn't just a moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something going on with the
temperatures were warmer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just conditions were different in 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're having this issue with we got
good stand establishment in one year and
[SPEAKER_01]: then not so good in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with these lower populations,
we're still seeing some drop-off in the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time we get to harvest,
we've got less than 30 percent of the live
[SPEAKER_01]: seed we planted resulting in a harvestable
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that Paul did in his counts
was he didn't do this with every count,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least once a week, he was counting
the number of nodes on each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a representation of the number of
plants within each row that had a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: number of nodes on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see we start out with one,
two, three, and four node plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a week later, we've got some five
node plants, six node plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and we don't have as many small
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing and we saw this on
several occasions was that three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: after planting when it came to count,
all our plants had grown beyond the one
[SPEAKER_01]: and two node stage, but now we've got more
one and two node plants showing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is suggesting to us that we have
secondary flushes of seed emergence,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant emergence that are going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this established canopy and then
these smaller plants coming in underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: While these might be counted towards our
establishment period, some of these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: may or may not compete successfully to
become harvestable plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul did observe some plant loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some willow building of plants,
which we presume is probably dampening
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had predation by insects chewing on
plants, both what we call larger bivory
[SPEAKER_01]: and smaller bivory, which would be things
more like flea beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there were some instances of just
necrotic tissues that we couldn't explain
[SPEAKER_01]: from environmental stressors that were
happening in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did know that there were some,
we were losing some plants during that
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment period.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've seen from this is that these
inadequate stands may be a result of low
[SPEAKER_01]: initial emergence, seeds that never
emerge, which is what we saw seemed to see
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of in 2024, seedling death that
occurs during the establishment phase
[SPEAKER_01]: itself while the plants are still young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've got this loss of established
plants occurring through the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all areas that we need
additional research on in order to really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what's going on with our
population dynamics through the season
[SPEAKER_01]: with grain and fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: One area of study that we have worked on
in my lab is looking at seed quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, our seed lots were pretty poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the seed lots we were getting,
we would have seed lots with 60 years to
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were standard germination in a
growth chamber, not what we were seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp presents a challenge, I think,
for seed producers because of the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: matures and the fact that at any time that
they harvest, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain proportion of immature seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, hemp seed apparently does not store
well, particularly at high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, if you have high moisture and
high temperatures, then those seeds won't
[SPEAKER_01]: store as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing cold storage for the last
several years and having much better luck
[SPEAKER_01]: with preserving our seed lots that we've
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think the germination of seed lots
has improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do adjust all of our seeding rates,
as I said, based on a target seeding rate
[SPEAKER_01]: with germination and seed size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We correct everything to make sure we're
putting out the same number of seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, I think that seed lots
have improved in germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green bars represent the germination
for our seed lots that we received last
[SPEAKER_01]: year for the multi-state variety trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a lot of these are at 90% or
above.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few that are closer to 80,
particularly for some of the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, even with tobacco,
it's not uncommon for a newer cultivar to
[SPEAKER_01]: have lower germination rates while they're
in the process of trying to increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the purple bars were those same seed
lots that we had stored for a year at four
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at germination, and you can see
for the most part, our germination is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well-preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we had one seed lot that looks like
it may have gone down a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to doing the germination work,
Andrea is also looking at, we've acquired
[SPEAKER_01]: a vibe seed analyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things, it allows us to sort
seeds based on various parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we're sorting based on
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have brown seeds, which are presumably
seeds that were mature at the time of
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, white seeds, which were
approaching maturity, and green seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we presume to be relatively immature
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got them separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got them separated here just for the
purposes of this picture to show the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this machine, we can put a sample of
seed in there, and it will come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: give us the proportions of brown,
white, and green seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at seed sizes on those,
we've generally found that the green seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: do tend to weigh a bit less, be a bit
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: White seeds sometimes are way less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're pretty similar to the
brown seeds in weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: When she puts those in a standard
germination test, blue is our original
[SPEAKER_01]: seed lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see from that about 80% germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown seeds germinate at a higher rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: White seeds at a similar rate to the
original seed lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, green seeds can be quite a
bit lower in germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall germination rate of that seed
lot depends on the proportion of these
[SPEAKER_01]: lower germinating seeds that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested to try to continue
this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, this is just standard
germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to look at whether or not
these green seeds perhaps have lower
[SPEAKER_01]: viability as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only may they germinate at a lower
rate, those that do germinate potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: may have lower seedling vigor and not be
able to establish as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an ongoing area of research within
our lab to try to better understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: role of seed quality and seed vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul has also done some work looking at
root vigor and root growth in hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done this by growing hemp seedlings
in clear cylinders in a gel material
[SPEAKER_01]: that's meant to simulate a root growing
environment or soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come in and periodically take
pictures of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Paul is using a software to extract
information out about the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root length density, rooting depth,
root angles, all kinds of information that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can relate back then to the performance
of these varieties in their establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an example over time of the
variety X-59 at six days old, nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: 13, 15, and 21 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same root system, how it's developed
over time and rooting depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an example of what we're trying to do
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the rooting depth at 21 days and
the population counts that we had from our
[SPEAKER_01]: field studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a relative stand establishment
here, which basically is the stand
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment percentage of the cultivar
compared to the average for that year in
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, we had a big difference
in the two different years there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to correct for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how each variety performed
relative to the average of that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: trial and year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've correlated that with the rooting
depth that Paul measured in the gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a pretty good positive correlation
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: R squared is not real high, but 0.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul is going to continue with this work
to try to relate more of these rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics to the performance that
we're seeing in the field and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of that with some breeding
targets that we might go after for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked a lot about trying to reach
the target populations, which brings up
[SPEAKER_01]: the question of, what is the target
population?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we be shooting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a trial that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with a variety called Orion 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a monaceous type.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted it at target seeding rates of
100,000 up to 1 million seeds per acre in
[SPEAKER_01]: 100,000 seed increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, this is our count of plants at
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got healthy plants in the blue and
then the gray represents what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: diseased heads, those that were showing
obvious symptoms of some sort of disease
[SPEAKER_01]: that was affecting that floral structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing I thought we would
have where we would see better
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment maybe at some of the lower
rates and less of the thinning effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found was that across all the
planting rates, we roughly got about 20-25
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of the live seed we planted turned
into a harvestable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 100,000 planted seeds, we got 20,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a million planted seeds, we got 200,000
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get anywhere near our target,
but surely this big difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: population will make a difference in grain
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what I hypothesized would
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hemp is a very plastic plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even at lower populations, we got more
branching and we found that our grain
[SPEAKER_01]: yields really didn't change that much
across all of those different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar thing we did in 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only got about 20 percent of our
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did increase up to 1.2 million seeds
per acre, but we still didn't get much
[SPEAKER_01]: over 200,000 plants per acre at harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, our yields were a little more
variable in 2024, but still no consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern related to plant population.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we get at a lower population,
as I said, is fewer individuals but highly
[SPEAKER_01]: branched versus single stalks and larger
numbers of single stalks per unit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't mean the population isn't
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still, I think, need to achieve higher
density populations for some practical
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons of harvest and certainly for
fiber, we need to be trying to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these higher plant populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, we have more work to do to
understand what's going on with our seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mention our planting methods just
very briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started out, we were using the old
planter in conventional ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: very heavily worked tilled soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020 and 2021, we did not have good
results with this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beginning in 2022, we shifted to a no-till
planting in our system where we were going
[SPEAKER_01]: into a wheat cover crop that had been
sprayed to kill that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also went from a planting depth of
about a quarter inch deep or about
[SPEAKER_01]: three-quarters of a centimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to about two centimeters deep or
three-quarters of an inch deep in this
[SPEAKER_01]: planting method.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons for that is that with
where we do the tillage and we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: very fine seed bed, we had a lot of issues
with soil crusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plant's not being able to break
through that crust very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with our no-till system,
this was our 2024 stands here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting better establishment out of
that no-till system, although we still
[SPEAKER_01]: have some rather large gaps in some of our
rows and we're still not achieving our
[SPEAKER_01]: target population goals even with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to just very briefly mention
some work that we did with planting dates,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to establish the impact of planting
date and planting depth with two different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, our target population in this case
was 680,000 pure live seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tara Caton, who was my field manager at
the time, was over a lot of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the only consistent thing that we
saw was that generally we did get better
[SPEAKER_01]: stands with deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The planting date variable tended to be
more impacted by what happened immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: after that planting date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see a consistent trend from
early to late with planting date,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we did tend to see better results out
of our deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with our 2022 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did see in this trial, the light green
bar was our populations at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment and the blue bars were at
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were seeing in a lot of our
earlier studies, well, a lot of our later
[SPEAKER_01]: studies as well, but like we've seen in a
lot of these studies, we're losing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants throughout the season to various
losses there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain yield in 2021, very little impact of
planting depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the early planting dates, as we got
later, deeper planting date was more
[SPEAKER_01]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in 2022, it was kind of the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early planting dates, we had an
advantage for deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did in the middle dates and then
at the late date, again, an advantage for
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, just quickly summarize the yield
results on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find that we tended to get better
yields with deeper planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the direction that we've moved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've now gone ahead and even moved a
little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more like now between an inch deep,
so about two to two and a half centimeters
[SPEAKER_01]: on average is what we're shooting for now
with our planting depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to wrap up, there are some remaining
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonaline or ethofluraline is the active
ingredient in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's recently been labeled for use on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used it the last couple of years in
our variety trials, but there are certain
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds like the yellow nutsedge that's in
this picture that are not controlled by
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some weed control issues
that we're going to have to tackle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insect pests, and diseases like Fusarium
head blight, the most prevalent one that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have here in Kentucky, and the most
prevalent insect pest that we got on our
[SPEAKER_01]: green crops, hemp crops is corn earworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This integrated pest management is
something that Magdalena has been working
[SPEAKER_01]: on in my program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other challenges that we're facing
and that I think our growers will be
[SPEAKER_01]: facing if we commercialize production in
grain hemp is when to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially, our target is at 50 to 75%
brown seeds, but is this true across all
[SPEAKER_01]: locations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this true for all cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that we need to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, it's just hard to know even when
you're out there, they're looking at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really difficult to assess when
you're at this point at 50 to 75%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we harvest too early, we get too high
of a proportion of immature seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're high moisture and cause problems
for drying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're too late in harvesting,
then we've lost seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had losses to birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That continues to be a problem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things to be worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, if we move to commercialization,
we've got a lot of logistics in harvest to
[SPEAKER_01]: work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture from 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why Paul is smiling in this
picture because he's just climbed out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of that combine from about 30
minutes of trying to clean out this
[SPEAKER_01]: massive water fiber that was tangled up in
our straw beater in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a common occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to do this several times a day
to clean out that machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely a challenge for moving
forward with grain hemp for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I know I went through a few
things a little bit fast there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to stop at that point and
see if we have any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might read the first questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing and explaining,
Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think are the main factors for
Kentucky not doing as well as,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, New York, Vermont,
or even Montana for grain and fiber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the latitude versus the source of
the seeds, or is it moisture or rain or
[SPEAKER_00]: something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it's the seeds because
we're all using the same source of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in that multi-state trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the latitude has a lot to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe soil temperatures playing something
of a role in that, but that's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think we're striving to try to
figure out a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of it does have to do
with just the latitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at a lot of the early
cultivars that we had, they were developed
[SPEAKER_01]: at northern latitudes and then we're
trying to adapt them to the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the newer ones that we have coming
along that have been adapted specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for southern latitudes are performing more
consistently in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question is whether or not we
evaluate fiber quality as part of the dual
[SPEAKER_01]: crop trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really looking at specific fiber
quality like the tensile strength or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: About as far as we go with that,
we are doing a simple decortication.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the ratio of vast to herd
with that, but we're not specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the fiber quality parameters
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question is in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many acres are being grown and how
many farmers are growing the varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're studying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this year we're probably going to
have, I'm going to guess, I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers yet for sure, but we're
probably going to have about five or 6,000
[SPEAKER_01]: acres grown in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of that is going to be
cannabinoid hemp still.
[SPEAKER_01]: That market has come back a little bit in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only probably going to be less
than maybe about 100 to 200 acres of fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp that are grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are growing a variety that we
have recommended from our trials and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 or 40 acres of grain hemp that I know
of in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what's being grown currently is
not grain or fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please explain the differences between
live seeds versus the total number of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and then seed quality with
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, 66% germination rate is for
all seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say a 66% germination rate,
that's basically taking the seed that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've received, the whole sample out of
the bag and testing it in a standard
[SPEAKER_01]: germination test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's of all the seed that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we make that correction and we say we
are planting pure live seed, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming that if we have germination in a
standard germination test, then it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: live seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do then is we determine our total
number of seeds per acre or plants per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre that we're targeting and then back
calculate from that to only plant live
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we also make an adjustment for the
seed size because there's quite a range of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed size in there and make an adjustment
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a grower, as we move towards seed
certification, that information will
[SPEAKER_01]: typically be on the seed tag that a grower
can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germination and the number of seeds per
pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird predation is another major factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Paul see any loss of seed due to bird
predation?
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try some seed coatings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably do need some seed coatings to
deter bird predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul didn't specifically mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will mention that with that old seeder
that we had, the old red one, that I
[SPEAKER_01]: showed, the first year we were doing it,
I remember riding on that thing and we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: made a pass down the field with it and we
were coming back up the next row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked over and there was a whole flock
of morning doves on the plots that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: just planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were strangely walking in straight
lines down the rows that we had planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think bird predation of seed is
potentially another major issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of pre-emergent would you
recommend for fiber hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the only one that I know of that's
labeled is the sonaline, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylfluoroline from a company called
Gowan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only one that's actually
labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do use in our no-till plantings,
we are using glyphosate as a burndown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not technically labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't labeled for that use yet,
but that is what we've been doing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the ideal pure live seed to plant
for grain, fine bast fiber, herd
[SPEAKER_01]: production goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah, what do you mean by, if you're
asking about what variety is best for each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those, or the actual seed target
numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about seed target
numbers, what we're currently planting for
[SPEAKER_01]: grain, we're planting the 680,000 seeds
per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fiber, we're shooting more for about a
million seeds, pure live seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you see our results,
we're not getting too close to those
[SPEAKER_01]: targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow-up question on the fiber quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know which university or research
organization is looking at agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects on fiber quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think North Carolina State is doing some
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some work going on with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see James has just put into the chat
there that the ARS unit in Louisiana is
[SPEAKER_01]: developing some fiber standard or was
going to be developing some fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think North Carolina is working
with their textiles group as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: James has indicated that they just sent
some samples to the ARS in Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that the grain yield does not change
at different planting rates, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal planting rate for practical
harvest with a combine avoiding the
[SPEAKER_01]: branchiness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Luis, I think we're still primarily at
that 680,000 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're planting that and getting a
couple hundred thousand plants per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see we have a few more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will try to finish at two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for connecting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bob, for answering all of our
questions and for that wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to happily answer questions if
people want to email me afterwards rpierce
[SPEAKER_01]: .uky.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
