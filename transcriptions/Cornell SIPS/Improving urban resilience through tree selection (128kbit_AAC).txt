[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will talk about tree selection and
hopefully I will end this presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: within the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we'll see what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start to try to explain what I mean
with improving our urban resilience when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to tree selection because today
the urban habitat or the last decades or
[SPEAKER_00]: so the urban green infrastructure have
been identified as a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: element in order to create the resilience
to both current happenings but also future
[SPEAKER_00]: happenings like climate change but also
new functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving more and more people in urban
areas and more pressure to urban areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: the green infrastructure have been
identified as one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: elements in order to meet these changes
and new demands for urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the green
infrastructure goes from everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut lawn to shrubbery to pocket
woodlands, tree trees, green roof,
[SPEAKER_00]: green walls, even the pots on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these together is recognized as a
green infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the plants which
individual plants and plantation that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the biggest impact trees is
outstanding when it comes to delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of services and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about this ecosystem services
that trees can be delivering for an urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in order to create resilience
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a compilation by Johanna
in her thesis and I just stole it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to steal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just stole it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shows really good what trees and
the green infrastructure can deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most things that you hear about is
this regulating ecosystem services like
[SPEAKER_00]: storm water management, microclimate
mitigation, pollution relief and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also other functions like
cultural provision supporting ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: services as well where trees can and have
the capacity to deliver a great share of
[SPEAKER_00]: all this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we come to urban environments
today, the spaces where it's allowed for a
[SPEAKER_00]: tree planting or plantation, it gets fewer
and fewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the few places where you are allowed to
plant trees, this plantation is not only
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a good looking space to create a
local identity for the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's equally important to serve many kind
of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why tree selection is really,
really crucial when it comes to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience in urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and also this, that the capacity
for the trees to deliver a function
[SPEAKER_00]: increased by space and condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well growing trees, large trees of
course deliver or have the higher capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: to deliver this function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, the thing we plant here have
to reach to this in order to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing the plant selection is
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes, of course, site
preparation, but good in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but also the plant selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we focus on this speaks anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually how it looks many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a parking space in the southern
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, it looks worse than it is
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a space where water can go through
and it's a structural soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main idea here was that this
plantation should mitigate the urban heat
[SPEAKER_00]: island effect by shading the space,
but also shading the cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dogs and people in the cars and die
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes some time, but also the space is
part of the local stormwater management in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to mitigate that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the problem is here is completely
wrong plant materials are selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selecting a sycamore maple,
a maple tree that needs moist condition
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less all throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if this is a good space,
the situation will not give that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant selection completely wrong
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you completely fail and it costs a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a situation in southern
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it are both there in Ithaca,
New York City, all over the world where
[SPEAKER_00]: plant selection is completely wrong for
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to, because it costs a lot of
money to replace this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also producing trees are going to die
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to increase our knowledge about
plant selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one side of the coin when it
comes to plant selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lack of diversity within urban
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study we did a couple of years
ago in Scandinavia when we developed and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated the urban tree population in
Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the street environment in
Helsinki.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this, capital of Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oslo, capital of Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's just few species that
stand for the dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a disease hits one of these,
Oslo risk to lose 44.3% of the street tree
[SPEAKER_00]: in just over a year maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you lose the resilience for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes many, many years in order to
build that up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a Scandinavian problem
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an international problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a study we are working on
where we try to evaluate the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in urban areas around the world
in the northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is street environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see Pittsburgh, four species stand for
more than half of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beijing, China, three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camden, which is a borough in central
London, UK, four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain, three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a situation we have around the
world where there is a lack of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't say lack of diversity in
Brazil in the same centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're standing in front of,
the two main challenges we're standing in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of is first, increased knowledge
about untraditional or rare tree species
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to introduce a wider diversity of
urban trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, start to understand or start to
develop knowledge about their capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: this new untraditional plant materials,
in order to grow on really challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: growing condition, but also their capacity
to deliver different kind of ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the two challenges we stand
in front of today and the work we are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done for many years,
but we're doing here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're probably going to continue
forever and ever anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an introduction of what I
like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So developing site-related knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what Nina said, learning from
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in nature, trees and plants
generally have developed different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and strategies or even
personalities in order to compete for
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, in order to compete for or
tolerate different kind of climates and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by developing knowledge about which
kind of traits species have, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: find their use potential also in urban
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in nature, there is plants like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that can take more or less
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of different kind of super
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that can take a punch or two and
still be standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quote here that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a plan until they get
punched in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really good because this is
what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have a plan how to take this punch
and still be good looking, still be
[SPEAKER_00]: standing, still be performing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are plants which are stupid
or maybe not that clever that have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed less different and can't take
many punches, even if this person probably
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves many punches in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, when it comes to plant selection,
it's important to start to know how well
[SPEAKER_00]: they can take or which kind of super
powers or personality plants have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of strategies or traits they
have, but also how well developed these
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in urban environment, there is a lot
of stress factors that affect the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main stress factors that
trees is facing today will probably face
[SPEAKER_00]: even more in the future climate is lack of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water stress is the main counter for
trees in urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the urban environments are more
warmer climate with more effective
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you have a very effective water
runoff for all these hard surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, the space for many trees,
especially below ground, is limited
[SPEAKER_00]: because of space of pipes and other things
in this multifunctional place as urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments represent today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're focusing is drought stress
for trees and see what kind of superpowers
[SPEAKER_00]: they have in order to deal with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a compilation by our
colleagues, Andrew Irons from my school
[SPEAKER_00]: college that did this for a couple years
back, where he tried to put together how
[SPEAKER_00]: trees dealing with water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that you can divide them
in two groups, avoiding water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their second is just take the water
stress and tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will start with avoidance,
the tree, how trees can avoid water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have two subcategories,
like maximum maximizing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hard word for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acquisitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, of course, that's the main
thing is to invest in a root system that
[SPEAKER_00]: can support a tree with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main avoiding strategy that
most of the plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have this one, reduce water
use or reduce water loss by, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata closure, reduce leaf and stem
growths, the investing and probation of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, Ficke corticula, but also this one,
which is less attractive, so to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: just throwing the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from a close to our
summer house in southern Sweden in a place
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have a thin soil layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have rocks and just half a meter of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of weeks, really warm and
dry weather, the root system can't support
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't support the tree with water
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some trees don't have any second plan
or plan B.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just rely on tree roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the tree roots fail, they have no
idea how to deal with the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go into panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what's happening,
just throwing the leaves in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it on many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the birches, Bertula pendula in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also see it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the plantation here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a structure of soil here,
which is better than normal, it's better
[SPEAKER_00]: than it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trees, this is from August four
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're panicking, they just have no
idea what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root calls the tree crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any water down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go into panic and don't want to
lose anything and throw the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can compare to the trees here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant at the same time, and they have more
or less an unlimited rooting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still green and doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of avoidance
strategy, avoiding when it comes to roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other example of avoidance
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I showed you this last year when I
had to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a silver lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver linden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these American names of tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilia tomentosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from Republic of
Moldavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also invest in a root system,
of course, in order to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also invest in other tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, perbesion leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they invest in a special perbesion or
hair type, which is this star hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like small micro umbrellas,
which are covering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say underside of the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underside of the leaf, which reduce the
loss of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another avoidance strategy the
silver linden use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the silver linden have another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of avoidance strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting forest,
just on the border between Romania and
[SPEAKER_00]: Republic of Moldavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to bring your passport when you
go into this forest, because you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know which country you're going to end in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that mistake a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you can say the silver linden in
an oak forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very warm, warm and dry day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see also in the plantation
here that a warm day, the silver linden is
[SPEAKER_00]: more silver compared to a more moist and
cool day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on a warm day, they turn the leaf
upside to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, they reflect away some
of the sunlight, which makes the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't heat up in the same amount as
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the leaf doesn't warm up that much,
they don't have to use a lot of water to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool down the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very clever way to, in a warm
day, reduce water loss by reflecting away
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight and doesn't get that
upheaval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of avoiding
strategies trees have in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the research we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to identify all these types of
strategies, avoidance strategies trees
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also try to understand how good they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root system, of course, is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the root system, or when the soil
dries up, what kind of other plants do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in order to step up and take the
drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, same picture again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same situation, very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are trees that have the same
lack of water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root system fails to support the tree,
but the tree doing well anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an interesting strategy we are
looking at that we have been looking a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit extra to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tolerance that's taking the punch,
so to say, and still be standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take the drought in order to avoid it,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to a tolerance of
limited water availability, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: several different kind of strategy that
trees have developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmotic adjustment, for example,
elastic adjustment, but also low turgor
[SPEAKER_00]: loss point, which have been a special
interest for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a very low turgor loss
point, you have the potential to just shut
[SPEAKER_00]: up, just to stand there, take the punches,
and wait out the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the rain weather comes,
it just goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the interesting to see how much
you can shut up, and how long you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why three years ago we started a
project together, which is a collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: between the Swedish Agricultural
University, Cornell with Nina,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with Myers School College in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Dr. Andrew Irons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called the project Shut the Hell Up
or Die, which is actually what it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to see how much a tree can or why
they can standing there and just shut the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also see how long you can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long, how many punches you can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's important to see in
situation where you need to have trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that can standing and taking the punch off
the punch and still looking good and
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low turgor loss point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that was interesting to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turgor loss point can be used as a
universal measure of physiological drought
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance that is quantified and
measurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very attractive for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rank species in terms of their
physiological drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because today when you rev your
literature, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tolerance for drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say this is better than other
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very attractive that if it's
possible to rank species, actually give a
[SPEAKER_00]: number to actually say this is drought
tolerance this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's easier to pinpoint which species
that can be used on that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in that site, you have to take the
drought this much and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem before is that taking to
measuring the turgor loss point is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you read minds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time consuming work, which means that
maybe for a year, you work with four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take the turgor loss point
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to diversity,
we have to look at a large share of
[SPEAKER_00]: species in order to see the potential of
which one can be introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for nurseries, or landscape architects,
or tree planners, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last three years or four years
ago, a group in China, together with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in California, come up with that
there is a close relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: osmotic adjustment and turgor loss point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it possible in a much
easier way to develop or to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: the turgor loss point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use another methodology,
but also it's possible with new techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it more easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it possible to create turgor
loss point in a much easier way and faster
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, we spent more or less a
whole year to just adjusting this
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology, testing back and forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the work that had been done before
had been developed for subtropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical, and Mediterranean plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working in temperate zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're testing back and
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results last year have been
actually published or accepted for
[SPEAKER_00]: publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be published anytime
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we was looking at maples, 27 different
species and genotype of maples we tested
[SPEAKER_00]: last year when it comes to turgor loss
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I thought it was
interesting to actually do some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also you can see, because the more
negative pressure you can take,
[SPEAKER_00]: the longer you can shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer you can take the drought after the
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these avoidance strategies fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take a longer drought before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because turgor loss point, if I should
explain it, is that when the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: failed to deliver water, you go into a
wilting position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell structure leaves just
shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can shrink to a special level,
and then they just implodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cell structure just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investment the trees have done for
that leaf, everything is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't produce any photosynthesis
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this level, before the cell structure
just implode and destroyed, different
[SPEAKER_00]: between different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some species can take just three or
four days of drought, and then the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: structure just goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some, they have a very strong cell
walls and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can take a very low negative
pressure without get damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these species down here with a long
cell structure can take a long drought and
[SPEAKER_00]: a very high negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, they can take the
drought and still have an active
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still can capture resources and invest
in roots and strats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very positive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the species up in the top there can
take a very short, and then the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that understand or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting here that there is a
difference between the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the spring, some of the
species that are very, very strong in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer are weak in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting when it comes to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have drought in different parts of
the season that we didn't thought before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will go through and show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it means more practically is that
the trees or the species or the genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that belongs to the group up there,
which have a very low negative pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the species that rely very much
on the root system of avoiding strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should never, ever be planted
outside very generous parking vines,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are unlimited resources for
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also have a good water holding
capacity in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the trees where they
grow naturally, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Acer spicatum, which was the
weakest one in this test, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: place where you can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along streams, as an understory species in
moist woodlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the case also for Acer
pensyvonicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what these species are
called in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stick to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're scientific names.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the tree man state park
outside Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also Acer trumcatum, or mono,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the Tingling Mountain in
China, where I did my PhD work,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you can see it as an understory
tree inside a protected moist forest
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trees that have a low trigger loss
point, they grow naturally in sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good guidance also for tree
planters, landscape park, that these trees
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the equipment to grow in street
environments, where you have periods with
[SPEAKER_00]: really severe droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should always be a garden or park
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I have the other group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the guys that can take droughts
for a longer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be planted in more challenging
growing conditions, like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a courtyard where deep rooting strategy
is not that clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't force the root system
through the office here, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lots, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trees here have to have a B,
C, and a D plan to take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys have the potential to be
growing here, be growing well,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking good, delivering all these
ecosystem services they wanted in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if their condition is really,
really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at where they grow in
nature, you can find them growing really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenging growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Acer granadentatum from Utah in
Sino National Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to grow here, you have to
have strategies more than just the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to step up and take the other
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from the steppe forest of
Eastern Europe, Acer tataricum together
[SPEAKER_00]: with Quercus pubescens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you should grow here on the
steppes of Eastern Europe, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a tolerance to take weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of drought, really severe drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I have Nina in the
audience, I have to show this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody who takes Nina's
classes, they know that Acer tataricum is
[SPEAKER_00]: named as shit on a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Nina doesn't like this tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm just showing her how
good looking tree it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Lund, Sweden, on a courtyard
with a parking deck below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen enough, Nina?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll give her a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in the same study, it shows that
also within the same species, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference between different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is interesting when it comes to
selection, that within species,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find both sensitive but also
really, really tolerant genotype or
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our red maple, three different
kind of genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's really attractive when my
new job, when I have to travel around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to collect species, that this
mythology makes it possible to screen in
[SPEAKER_00]: an early stage the potential of the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are hunting for drought-tolerance
tree species or species for our genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: for a future climate, we can use this
technology or the mythology we develop in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to screen in an early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to wait three generations of
garden owners before we know it's tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a really early screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the work we did last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, we went all in to screen as
many species as we could in order to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially among the untraditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the work from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will go through them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what's happening when you get
carried away in your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like one more species,
just one more day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about 140 species of genotype
we're testing this year in order to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can see the significant
difference between species and genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to drought-tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main work is not only to create
this data set, but also testing
[SPEAKER_00]: untraditional or red tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can't just go to conference and
say that everybody are idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nursery industry or the landscape
architecture industry, we have to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them some kind of guidance or confidence
in order to shift from a traditional plant
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to testing new plants and new
species and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by this research, it's possible to
actually show them that, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a comia holmoides, I think it's Chinese
rubber tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the English name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look it up.
Hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wrong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, rubber tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can show them that the most common
tree, for example, in Sweden is
[SPEAKER_00]: tilakodata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can show that this is fully hard
in Sweden, but much, much more tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: for dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be better in urban streets
environments compared to tilakodata,
[SPEAKER_00]: which when it comes to dry condition,
they have all these things going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydews and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to identify the trees that
belongs up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Sweden, in a way, the landscape
architect really, really like magnolia
[SPEAKER_00]: cobbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new trendy trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wanted everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also start to force them into
street environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the result, they look like crap
because they just have wilting leaf in
[SPEAKER_00]: July, no flowering, dying off in the tree
crown zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important also that show
that magnolia cobbles is and will be an
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusive park tree or garden tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should never be forced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this research, it's possible
to have that kind of communication that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take many punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take one and then down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's equally important to identify the
tough ones, but also the weak ones in the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication when it comes to
diversification of urban environments and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this data set, I just narrow
it down a little bit to go through some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or some groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done 22 different genotypes of oaks
we're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's huge differences
between them, also within the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear in mind that this axle is changing a
little bit in number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also this work, this is from Birches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made not here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made in Ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden, which is the Botanic Garden in
Liverpool, UK, by Andrew Irons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the man director there just wrote
a monograph on Birches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted us to come there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, we have been invited to Kew
Garden in London to do a screening of
[SPEAKER_00]: their trees there because they want to
know the future potential of the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: stock they have at the Botanic Garden and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the word started to spread there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope next year we can present some
really interesting data when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: red trees from Botanic Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we tried some shrub species,
me and Ina.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see this is ground covering
shrubs we just started with and played a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can see also there is a big
difference between species and cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also when it comes to use potential,
where the potential is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was my goal when we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will try to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty boring, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll try to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nina Metze Valadares presented a paper in
2006 by ranking drought tolerance for 800
[SPEAKER_00]: wooded species, shrubs and trees,
by reviewing where and how they grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, once again, just assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between three and four, it should be a
little bit drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can show, we put our data
based on their ranking, and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a really close relationship with
our data with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do, we can actually show
not only between three or four should be
[SPEAKER_00]: there, we can actually show a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also interesting that some of our
most drought tolerant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, Syringa reticulata.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you base things on review or
review literature, you can read about the
[SPEAKER_00]: species where it grows in southeast
Siberia, when it grows in cool and moist
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to the mountains in China,
it grows together with Ailanthus or
[SPEAKER_00]: Choloteria, one of the most drought
tolerant species on very, very rocky and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that book they didn't read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they put them in as not that
drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you're reviewing ecological
literature together with the research
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, we are in the start,
and we start to develop this database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, next year, we can add another
100 to this list and so on and work it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of side projects,
which is interesting, where we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you stress a tree, they can step
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually increase the turgalos points
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also important to see the window,
how much they can take, not only when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing in a park environment,
but also when you stress them and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: much they can step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species doesn't have that capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species have a very wide capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear in mind, this is just the
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, it's really interesting
or very useful in order to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: with tree users or plant users or plant
designers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time do I have left?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would like to show another
perspective that we work with as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to plant selection,
many things that trees, right tree for
[SPEAKER_00]: right site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to add another aspect of
that, right tree for right site and
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to urban tree or
urban forestry today, everybody's talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about increase the urban tree canopy and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we increase with 10%, we will gain
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we add another 10%, we will gain
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's different between trees and
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to landscape
architect, and I'm one of the most hated
[SPEAKER_00]: teachers in my university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm the guy that shows up in the
presentation and just ask them,
[SPEAKER_00]: why this green blob there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what should it do there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a street.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plant trees along the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I fail them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to, every dot, they have to have
an idea why and which tree should be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to buying a car,
we don't go in and say, I just want to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we buy a car, we have a lot
of ideas what we want for the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of car, how should I look in the
car, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of stereo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of all this bling-bling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't do that, if you just go
in there and say, I want a car,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can end up with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you can end up with
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both is a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the capacity between them is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we're doing when it comes
to tree selection for ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or trees are good for pollution,
reducing pollution, or mitigating urban
[SPEAKER_00]: heat island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we plant tree, without
thinking of where to place them and which
[SPEAKER_00]: species to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very, very frustrating,
because it's much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this tree is not a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two good examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are from Stockholm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Manchester, UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the tree selection had been really
good, probably it's just luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes they're using species that
are doing a good job there, taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind or shading the situation where it's
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you can actually can plant
tree and make more problems rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: actually benefits for the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to show, this is research
I'm just part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Johanna, raise your hand, is the main
person behind this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the plant geek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the end just adding some trees and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to just show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a climate modeling program where
it's possible to see the effect of urban
[SPEAKER_00]: green infrastructure and how we can adjust
the microclimate in a building area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Minecraft from grown ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're building up a neighborhood in a 3D
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you add numbers of the houses,
the concrete houses, the wooded house,
[SPEAKER_00]: how tall they are, what kind of roof it
is, if you have climbing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also which kind of glasses and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's not only taking the build
up environment, but also the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of surface is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it concrete, gravel, grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shrub plantation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall the tree is?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of levels and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you build this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called EnvyMet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can download it for free on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you add local climate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you press the bottom and take a
weekend or 10 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been harvesting for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem in the beginning was that
the plant data is not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work we have done for three or four
or five years.
Yeah.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been collecting this leaf area
index data for I think it's about 75 or 83
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we add these values in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can ask different kind of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also for pollution, but also for wind
speed, for microclimate and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can get good pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you would say they have stupid
politics like Donald Trump and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in Sweden, we have pretty slow minded
people that are politic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a model where it's possible to
show or to communicate the effect of green
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure within building areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you when it comes to wind
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the housing area with no trees
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ocean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of wind comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a really window,
especially in this passage when you force
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have more or less a storm
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good when you do this
study to ask dog people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people with dogs need to go out
every day, even if it's snow storm or
[SPEAKER_00]: raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask them, where's the worst part?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can actually give the exact same
what this modeling program do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the effect if you add due to
the master plan with a fancy landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they even were here to look
at the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did more traditional way of
placing the green infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees here, a group of plantation here,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they reduce the wind
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did after that is to place,
just to change some of the species to
[SPEAKER_00]: other species, but also place them in
other sites, so to say, in order to gain
[SPEAKER_00]: the most effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by using this program and also adding,
you can show that species selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only placing the species, but also
which kind of species we're using matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to winter, you have the
branch area index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have long winters in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to care about how the trees are
acting in the winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the winter, we don't want any
tree not close to buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sun that hits the buildings in
wintertime warms up as much as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce 30% of the heating cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money we can use by just
using the sun energy, just hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: facades in wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by placing trees too close in the
wintertime with too dense canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can cool down and actually increase the
heating costs in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have a negative ecosystem
services, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by placing trees, just increasing tree
canopy without actually thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: where and how to place them, we can
actually cause problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want trees that have a dense canopy
summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of high leaf area index that
cool down facades and building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if we have a square where we have
torghandel, markets and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a square in the summertime,
we want to have shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the winter, we want to have a lot
of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we look at is trees that are dense
in the summer, but sparse in the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let a lot of sunlight through the tree
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a research of evaluating
different tree species when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: branch area index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is ginkgo biloba, which is more
like a joke when it comes to shading
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime, because it doesn't have
anything, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a carpinus betulus fastegiata,
which is a hornbeam upright, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can shade a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the ginkgo can't
reduce any winds in a wintertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: because winds is another shielding factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to maybe have trees
close to the building, but a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further away to reduce winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ginkgo doesn't do anything,
while the hornbeam do a great job for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have something in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is islandus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an evaluation about 55 or 60
species or genotypes of trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30, 35 years old, planted at the same
time, planting at the same site,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was evaluating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that when it comes to
branch area index, that's the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: tree crowns in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have ginkgo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Stockholm, a new ginkgo
plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the most dense is the upright
carpinus, or the hornbeam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did, we are playing around with
this, and we met again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we placed, this is a courtyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main wind comes from the west here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we placed a tree row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it's a hedge, but it's not,
because in the program, if the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: touches each other, then it looks like a
hedge, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a traditional tree row.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did is using the data,
or the values we collected from this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, the field, the branch area index
data, and added into the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how much they can reduce the wind,
which is a very important ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: service when it comes to Sweden,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have that warm summers,
but we have cold winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing the wind and the cold
temperature winter time is more important
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to reduce energy costs,
but also a really good outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ginkgo biloba.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Noel Maple, emerald queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honilong locust, or deditia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turkey oak, Corlew's coluna, Fasigata
hornbeam, and last, upright type of
[SPEAKER_00]: western pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to care which trees we are
placing where, because there is different
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity within, between species,
and even between genotype within the same
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't just say that if we increase
the tree canopy by 10% or 50%,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will gain that, and this, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to force ourselves in the planning
of the green infrastructure to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, to talk about plant selection,
but also the spacing, where to put them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really clear research that
really shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published early this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want some copy of this paper,
please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this presentation is that
I would like to launch the statement that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool people, the most important
people, the new superheroes in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the plant geeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant geeks are the people
that knows all these stupid facts about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these stupid facts, all these details,
are important in order to build or
[SPEAKER_00]: construct resilient urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the graph that you showed with
the drought tolerance for spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then for summer, you're concentrating
on the summer data and more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: ignoring the spring data.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be in my talk here, but in the
presentation, we care about the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: data is equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's interesting that the weak
ones, so to say, they have more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: the same values in the spring as in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't change that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out weak and steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interesting that the most
drought-tolerant species in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are really, really weak in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the golden rain tree,
so it's a collateria aniculata,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the weakest in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the summer, it's maybe number one,
number two in our data, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also important when we
transplant the trees or establish the
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very weak in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to focus, even if it's
drought-tolerant, when it's established,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be really fragile in an
established phase, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring phase, that we have to be really
careful to walk in the plants and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's happening then with this
adjustment from the spring to the summer,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're having osmotic adjustment by
the tree because you've got a series of
[SPEAKER_02]: small stresses during that period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which adapts it to the drier conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we have some spin-off studies
going on beside this, trying to compile
[SPEAKER_00]: this big data set that we have trees that
grow, for example, in the plantation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have unlimited the same species,
or even the same genus of downtown,
[SPEAKER_00]: with more restricted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been actually done some root
penetrating routers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly how much space they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see that the trees in the
plantation, of course, because if I have
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited, why invest that much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything's good here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In downtown, they invest very,
very much, much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interesting in this data set,
the corotaria, the golden rain tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same high levels, even in the
plantation, as downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just invest in very high or very
low juggle-loss point, even if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: standing in an unlimited rooting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just programmed to be really
strong from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any other thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, corotaria, which is the
other species in the same study,
[SPEAKER_00]: have this huge adjustment between
plantation with unlimited space compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to, for example, the library downtown with
very limited rooting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have maybe half or double its
turbulence point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it more because they have
adjust for the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see there, there is among some
species, some species just have very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can see that there's a lot of
things we have to continue to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is to develop a
knowledge about the window, how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take, or that adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next step in this research,
to try to understand which species have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very narrow window.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here in Cercediphyllum,
it goes out weak, stays weak, and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have some other species,
like Corpus gluburgia, that have a way
[SPEAKER_00]: wide window on adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next phase, to try to create
these windows to see how wide they are and
[SPEAKER_00]: how narrow they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Erica, along those same lines,
if you look at a moisture release curve
[SPEAKER_01]: for a soil, a standalone soil,
the volume effort water content at a water
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of minus four megapascals,
for example, is vanishingly small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot of water has been left
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be interesting to look at the
duration of drought in reference to
[SPEAKER_01]: something like potential
evapotranspiration to see, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: to use a different metaphor, how long the
plant was going to have to hold its
[SPEAKER_01]: breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're investing a lot of energy in
making neutral osmonica for osmonica
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustment, and you're going to get
another six hours worth of ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract water, that might be a less
prudent kind of adjustment for investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think through this methodology,
we come up with a new spin-off and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: relate it here, try to relate it there,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should look at that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the very beginning of this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by creating this data set, and next
year we're going to compare to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to work with Replace at Kew,
we're going to work with Tony Garda,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also continue here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we create this database,
it's great to have a chance to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: play with it, to try to see the same
thing, but from different angles and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to end by saying thank you
for having me here for almost two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank Nina,
of course, for taking so good care of me
[SPEAKER_00]: here, both in Cornell, but also outside
the work here, by helping me to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: credit card, an American credit card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea how I got that.
I have a social security number,
just impossible to reach it.
I have to beat up some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the people at the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some, as you probably
understand, we have a lot of things going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and I will come back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to thank you for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it, and it was really
inspiring to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
