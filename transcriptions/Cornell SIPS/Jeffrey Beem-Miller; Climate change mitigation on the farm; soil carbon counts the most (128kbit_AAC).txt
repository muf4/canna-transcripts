[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate change on the farm soil carbon
counts the most well, let's see what we
[SPEAKER_00]: mean by that So starting with the backdrop
of climate change The context I'm framing
[SPEAKER_00]: this as a carbon problem, and that's
that's what it is so basically what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have is these this diagram represents the
major pools of carbon across the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: world and The numbers in black represent
how much carbon was There before we
[SPEAKER_00]: started extracting fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say 1850 So what we see is that
these red numbers represent?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much was how much carbon is moved from
these pools since that period so we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of 365 petagrams That's 10 to the
15th power grams And that went up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere and then over the past 150
years a lot of that ended up in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean But naturally it should cycle
through the ocean and also in through the
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial biosphere, so what we notice
here is that Soil organic matter is the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest terrestrial pool It's much larger
than the vegetation pool, and it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger than the atmosphere And it's also
much larger than the surface ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the main one that interacts in
this shorter term cycle So we really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see more of this co2 going into
the ocean because that's what's leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: sea level rise and acidification of the
ocean And so the idea is well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if we can enhance the strength of
this sink?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make more of this carbon go from
the atmosphere into the soil and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: What has kind of been the frame for what
I've been focusing on and what the frame
[SPEAKER_00]: for the project that Professor Wolf was
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the agricultural context is that in an
in an agricultural system we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and we Also have cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tractors so an agricultural system
is both a source and a sink for greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gases and What we want to do is focus on
enhancing the sink capacity the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of mitigation is to you know not drive our
tractors so much and Use less nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, but what I say is that soil
carbon counts the most and the reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: say that is co2 is the chief cause of
global warming climate change and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally what we have is that if we're
sequestering this carbon in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we call a win-win situation
for farmers So it's not only removing
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon from the atmosphere which helps the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Increasing the soil organic matter
which is good for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides fertility It also provides
some degree of drought protection flooding
[SPEAKER_00]: protection and that's an adaptation
capacity that's going to be useful
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly as we move forward and the
climate continues to change I should also
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that carbon sequestration There's
this potential for that to be a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue for farmers but one of the big
problems with that is it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure and so that brings us to What I've
mostly focused on This idea of soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration and so you may wonder Okay,
how fast does this actually happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this actually a realistic mitigation
approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is that it's not exactly
fast, but what is really important about
[SPEAKER_00]: this is there's a tremendous amount of
area And so this where this could be
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted these practices of carbon
sequestration So what we have here this
[SPEAKER_00]: figure is just from a recent paper called
climate smart soils But it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these different management
activities and then the relative amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas is amount of carbon I
should say specifically that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: stored or taken out of the atmosphere and
then the area of potential out of
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption, so we've got a log scale here
and We see that basically we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of area for these
particular practices So is it a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: well, yeah, there's a lot of potential but
like I said, there's a lot of challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: and The key ones is that the accounting is
very difficult and it's very costly and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's chiefly because the amount of soil
carbon in the soil is extremely variable
[SPEAKER_00]: so one space one place in a field you can
have another space a meter away and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be radically different and That sort of
transcends all scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these larger scale patterns of
soil carbon that are variable but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also goes right down to the micro site
where you have an aggregate that's full of
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon in one part of the soil and then
you know Millimeters or less away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no carbon at all or very little so
Added to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this issue where we just don't
have a sense of the baseline stocks as The
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller scale so we're trying to tell
whether or not our actions are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: having a positive impact and Then we have
furthermore this this idea of permanence
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay a farmer is growing cover crops or
reducing tillage and those are practices
[SPEAKER_00]: that are building up organic matter in
their soil But is that going to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they leave what if they decide to
start tilling again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's all lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to really get into that but
that's another important component of this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue So my research The first part of
what I did was kind of taking a very
[SPEAKER_00]: practical look at how do we go out and
take soil samples and one of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in fact around here is that there's
a lot of rocks in the soil and Your
[SPEAKER_00]: standard soil core when you pound it in if
you hit a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do you have a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a cost component with that
you could maybe collect a bigger sample
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to cost you more and then
maybe you're you think your samples fine
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually compare it to a
different sampling method in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: area, maybe you actually didn't do such a
good job And then I'll go in after talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that I'll go into this more into the
spatial variability with another study
[SPEAKER_00]: that was done at a site in Iowa Okay,
so soil carbon assessment rocks We have
[SPEAKER_00]: this is this is the United States
obviously in pink is concentration of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments And you can see that this green
area that's cultivated Areas, we largely
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do a lot of cultivation in the
rockiest areas, but there is a substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of overlap and this non-gravity
category this lightest pink could still be
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 15% rock fragments can actually be a
substantial amount of rock that can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems for sampling and also just
reduces the total amount of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: storage of carbon in the soil as You can
imagine you're not storing a lot of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're storing it in the organic matter So
there's basically two problems with rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is That when you are
collecting your sample, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put your pound your core in and you
hit a rock your first, you know Solution
[SPEAKER_00]: to that might be well, what if we sample
over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously there might be a different
dynamic in terms of the carbon in that one
[SPEAKER_00]: area where the rocks were you don't know
So that's that's one issue this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: avoidance issue and then there's the
secondary issue which I mentioned where
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe your particular tool is not doing a
good job of collecting representative
[SPEAKER_00]: sample so when you extrapolate you're
actually have this huge amount of bias
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're this area that's propagating
Okay, so This is a schematic start with
[SPEAKER_00]: this picture here on the left of a
theoretical corn soil and we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: two different soil cores, we've got A and
B and A here is representing a really
[SPEAKER_00]: standard soil core So it's it's either
driven by a hammer method or it's driven
[SPEAKER_00]: by Pushing such as like a Giddings machine
or a hydraulic push mechanism And then
[SPEAKER_00]: this B represents a new tool that we put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of borrowed from the forest
ecologists But it's this we call it the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotary core because basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a masonry drill So this coring bit
actually has small industrial grade
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds on it that are capable of
shearing through rock So it takes longer
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the soil, but potentially
you're shearing through the rocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating some of that bias So there's
there's two further issues that come into
[SPEAKER_00]: play which have to do with how you
actually calculate carbon stocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Soil again at carbon stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mass amount of carbon per unit area
and so you determine that by multiplying
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon concentration by the bulk
density of the soil and By the depth so
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got this volumetric measurement
that's converted to an area measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So In some this first equation here a lot
of people that just ignore rocks entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: which leads to a lot of problems And
there's another recent paper that talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about the magnitude of that error But
let's say you do things right and you use
[SPEAKER_00]: this equation number two and you calculate
bulk density as the soil mass of the fine
[SPEAKER_00]: earth so you sieve out all the rock
fragments and then you say okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what's that fine earth mass and So
if you use that term you get you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better and then you can take
into account the volume that was taken up
[SPEAKER_00]: by the rocks and so you're actually just
talking about the actual amount of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that could potentially sequester more
carbon or lose more carbon and These two
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures here Are just to illustrate a
potential issue that you run into when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually out there in the field and
you pull out pull out your core So imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario a here we started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We push this core down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We push that rock out of the way,
which is a problem We push down another
[SPEAKER_00]: rock Straight into the soil and then what
we have is a void In our core,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can't see right now,
but believe me it's there here it is So so
[SPEAKER_00]: then you push this rock down you've got
this void in your core and then you pull
[SPEAKER_00]: your core out and you measure the depth of
your hole and it's this deep and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the length of your core and it's
like this and not having this Vision and
[SPEAKER_00]: not being able to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So This could have been just compaction
This may just be the soil has been
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed or it may just be that you push
this rock down and it totally blocked the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the Core and you ended up with
this void So when you calculate bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density, the question is for this term
Which depth do you use to use the depth of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hole or the length of the core?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would actually we just sort of
added that into the experiment Because we
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that it could potentially be a
pretty big issue And then a further way to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this these carbon stocks is Do
you talk about it in terms of depth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is sort of the more intuitive way to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, okay Well, we have X amount of
carbon for you know, 30 centimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for every hectare sure that's fine
but the problem is these the bulk density
[SPEAKER_00]: component starts to get in the way of
accurate estimates of carbon stocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the reason is because Things that
change the bulk density such as you know
[SPEAKER_00]: driving over your field with a tractor
Aren't changing the carbon but it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected in your estimate of carbon
stocks Yes Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another factor that influences bulk
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's primarily what we're concerned
about You know, we collect the soils we
[SPEAKER_00]: bring back to the lab and dry them down
and then we express the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration on the on a dry mass basis
But the soil moisture really affects how
[SPEAKER_00]: easy it is to sample logistically and it
also affects the bulk density It's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an alternative Idea was proposed that
instead of using depth which can vary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know The soil surface may be up or
down depending on whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: rains whether or not you've tilled the
soil Any number of things that don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the changes in the soil carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if instead you just used mass as
your reference point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it gets compressed Down you'd
still have the same mass of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back to sample again,
you have something that's comparative and
[SPEAKER_00]: So a neat trick for that is you're gonna
sample by depth You don't know a priori
[SPEAKER_00]: what the soil mass is going to be so you
go out and you collect your soil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you take it back to the lab and you find
out how much carbon is in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: find out how much mass was there and then
you can create a relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: cumulative carbon mass and the cumulative
soil mass and you can draw a We've used a
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic spline function just a continuous
function that allows it allows this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to vary continuously and you
can talk about a given mass of soil at any
[SPEAKER_00]: point along this line
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's just some pictorial
Evidence of what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our rotary core.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the diamond tip bit pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our quantitative pit, which is
What we decided to be our gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you just go out there and you
Excavate this pit very painstakingly you
[SPEAKER_00]: measure every single bit of soil you take
out every rock and the volume is so large
[SPEAKER_00]: that you actually do get a representative
sample even when you have a lot of rocks
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil, this is this hydraulic push
device we call it's a Manufactured by a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called Giddings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just call it the Giddings But it's
mounted to a tractor or sometimes through
[SPEAKER_00]: a trailer And then this is our hammer
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got an electric jack hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's driving this soil core device into
the soil So this is in Hudson Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is up in Will's Barrow at Shazee Or
sorry up in Will's Barrow not at Shazee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out at Freeville And this is also
in Hudson Valley this these pictures we
[SPEAKER_00]: did the actual study in Freeville and we
also sampled at Harford at the Dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaching Research Center So we had these
four sampling methods and we had four
[SPEAKER_00]: sites three of which were at Freeville and
one of which was at Harford and they
[SPEAKER_00]: covered this sort of range of soil rock
fragment content and Then we had these
[SPEAKER_00]: three calculation approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we calculated bulk density using the
hole depth the core length and then we use
[SPEAKER_00]: this mass space approach and We use the
pit mass as the reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said well We don't really care what
our measured soil mass was from this
[SPEAKER_00]: coring method We're gonna just use the pit
mass and use the carbon concentration as
[SPEAKER_00]: measured by our coring device So at each
site we had three reps of these of a plot
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like this with a pit in the
middle And we had these sort of transects
[SPEAKER_00]: going out one side kind of left open so we
could work on the pit it caused a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trampling and then and we did it in this
way with three in a row so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: operate the Giddings in one straight pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to maneuver the tractor
if you are trying to alternate or do
[SPEAKER_00]: something sort of different arrangement
Okay, so what do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: chiefly we found that the hammer core does
not perform very well and That it's best
[SPEAKER_00]: to report on the mass basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these figures here I'm just showing you
data from the lowest rock fragment field
[SPEAKER_00]: which was less than 1% And then the
highest rock fragment which in our case
[SPEAKER_00]: was just 24% There's soils and our
cultivation that are much higher But so
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the high end of typical coring
growing soil for New York, which is why we
[SPEAKER_00]: chose it And then we have this dashed line
which represents our pit carbon stocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the percent difference relative to
the pit for these three different coring
[SPEAKER_00]: methods which are represented by these
circle or by these shapes and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of the different calculation
methods, so Basically, we see that even in
[SPEAKER_00]: the low rock fragment site the hammer core
didn't do very well You can see it's
[SPEAKER_00]: underestimating so carbon stocks and we
think that it has a lot to do With the
[SPEAKER_00]: vibration loosening the core And then we
also see that the circles the rotary core
[SPEAKER_00]: did quite well in both contexts and that
this Giddings method was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: variable in one case it overestimated
which you know, you can imagine that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be from compaction potentially And in
another case it underestimated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole depth approach So one final note on
this study is just to say that We wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to see which of those terms in that carbon
stock equation whether or not it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon the carbon Concentration or the
bulk density that are really driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: variance that you see expressed in carbon
stocks So we decompose the variance and
[SPEAKER_00]: just tried to see where it was coming from
and basically what you see Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to label these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the low rock fragment site again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the high rock fragment site So
what we see here is these white bars
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the contribution to total
variance of carbon stock from Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon concentration and that really
dominates at the low rock fragment site as
[SPEAKER_00]: you might expect but what you see at the
high rock fragment site is The bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density is really controlling the variance
that you see in your carbon stocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again is not too surprising But it's
nice to document that And then these gray
[SPEAKER_00]: bars is that's showing the covariance
between carbons carbon concentration and
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk density And so those are negatively
cope they covariate in a negative They
[SPEAKER_00]: have a negative relationship because when
bulk density When carbon concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: increases it actually makes the soil less
dense And so again, that's another reason
[SPEAKER_00]: that we prefer to express carbon stocks on
a mass basis instead of on a depth basis
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so shifting gears Talking about
spatial variability and getting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of the difference between
topsoil and subsoil carbon stocks so the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea behind This was there's we've got
these kind of two tools So we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture spatial variability of carbon
stocks, but we don't want to spend a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this one tool of geostatistics
which allows us to make fairly accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions in a field and places where we
didn't actually collect any data and Then
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this tool of spectroscopy,
which is just a lot cheaper for measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon You don't have to take a soil and
dry it down and then do all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation to it and run it through a
fancy $30,000 machine you just take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of it basically with a special
camera and Then you calibrate it with some
[SPEAKER_00]: known samples and then you can use that
calibration model for a lot more samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we found these these folks
who had attached a visual near-infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: photospectrometer to a Tractor basically
it could be pulled behind a tractor and it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just on one of the tines of the
tractor it drags this optical Sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: through the soil and takes a lot of
pictures pretty much And so what we get
[SPEAKER_00]: from that so this is the site where we
were where we Sampled and these look
[SPEAKER_00]: probably look like blue lines to most of
you guys But those are actually each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual points where measurements were
taken with this tool So this is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly 2,000 sampling points in this this
field here and then from those that really
[SPEAKER_00]: dense sampling those two really done
sampling points were able to Actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: a good sense of what the spatial
covariance is of soil carbon and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: interpolate To these spots where we didn't
sample and get a nice map of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter content of the field So This is
just I'm not going to go into a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot to take in at once,
but basically The idea was to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: after we kind of walked through this
process Sort of make it into a flow chart
[SPEAKER_00]: that would allow other people who might be
in the same position to know where to
[SPEAKER_00]: start and how to implement this in another
situation, so Basically, you know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: money you have how many variables you can
afford to collect etc And then the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I just wanted to point out here is
there's kind of two levels of this one is
[SPEAKER_00]: you collect your samples and you generate
kind of an average value of carbon stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: for your field and then Secondarily you
can predict at these on sample locations
[SPEAKER_00]: which is helpful for future monitoring if
you want to go back and see What's
[SPEAKER_00]: changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's again our study site we had
these two side-by-side fields one
[SPEAKER_00]: organically men are managed and one
conventionally managed the main difference
[SPEAKER_00]: was the organic had just manure as
fertilizer and no inorganic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and There were in addition to
corn and soy in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also oats and alfalfa here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just corn and soy So we collected
a hundred soil cores on each on each field
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt of 75 centimeters and then we had
this company come in and take these V and
[SPEAKER_00]: IR measurements and That's what those blue
dots are Okay, so Traditionally when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to sample, you know,
you want to be efficient about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so You're going out there and you know,
we will learn in statistics that simple
[SPEAKER_00]: random sampling is is great, but it's
inefficient right so You want to if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of control for the variance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you use things like blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stratification idea is akin to
blocks you're blocking And so there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: this information out there that you can
get from these elevation maps So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the USGS publishes elevation data
and you can download that for free and
[SPEAKER_00]: then from that you can use other freely
available software to generate what the
[SPEAKER_00]: slope is and then you can generate a
topographic wetness index and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: generate you can look at the curvature of
the slope and all these other things That
[SPEAKER_00]: may influence how water moves and then may
also have an influence on how soil carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: changes So one way if you don't have a
tractor mounted visual near-infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: photospectrometer is You could maybe just
work with this tool So What we did is we
[SPEAKER_00]: we were comparing those terrain variables
as a stratification approach with using
[SPEAKER_00]: soil data just like the soil maps you get
from the USDA with Our tractor mounted
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument to try to see which of those
stratification approaches How well they
[SPEAKER_00]: perform and whether or not it's an
improvement over just going out and
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly sampling So as you saw previously
we took a hundred soil cores in each field
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want no one would really ever do
that because no one would have the money
[SPEAKER_00]: for it So we thought well, what if we just
took 12 soil cores for each field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be enough to approach the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we get the same answer as we did
from a hundred soil cores?
[SPEAKER_00]: so In order to use those terrain
Covariance as you can probably see they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very there's a lot of correlation
between them so I used a principal
[SPEAKER_00]: component analysis to remove the
correlation and Then I took this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: an example for the conventional field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the first three principal
components and then I took those and I
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to say okay using that that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we take this continuous state data and
condense it into a single factor that will
[SPEAKER_00]: Generate a map like this and luckily
there's a nice little algorithm that does
[SPEAKER_00]: this a very simple one called k-means But
basically what it does is it partitions
[SPEAKER_00]: the total variance in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our three principal components here Can
we partition that into some additional
[SPEAKER_00]: groupings that will explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the variance that we're seeing in
our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this these are the number of
different clusters and I chose Four for
[SPEAKER_00]: this one because I thought it explained a
reasonable amount of the variance And then
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do is you can take that and
you can interpolate it again onto a map of
[SPEAKER_00]: your field So you end up with this map,
which I'll show you how the other
[SPEAKER_00]: stratification maps look in a minute But
you end up with this map where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: say, okay, I want to collect two samples
from green one from blue one from this
[SPEAKER_00]: light green and then you know you it
provides some way of Deciding where to
[SPEAKER_00]: take to collector samples So basically,
oh there goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so right so Once we went through
this process where we generated these
[SPEAKER_00]: strata and then we have all of our grid
points so Without looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that we have so we've already
collected the data and analyzed the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: cores But we sort of approach it naively
and say okay Well, which of these hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: points do we want to select based on the
stratification?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to test the stratification
approach, I just used a random sampling so
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chose 12 random samples from the
cluster and then I calculated an average
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon stock and I repeated that process a
thousand times and just looked at a
[SPEAKER_00]: histogram of the spread of the Results and
I did the same thing for the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: polygons.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just this the soil map units
These are this is the train indices for
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic and then this is what the
clusters look like from the V and IR on
[SPEAKER_00]: the go So results it's a lot to look at
but basically Well, so what we'll see here
[SPEAKER_00]: is that our simple random sampling
approach is very similar to what we get
[SPEAKER_00]: from stratifying by soil and by Terrain
variables, so we don't get much
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement by our stratification We would
have been fine just going out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly sampling on the grid So what we
have here is these are density histograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the area underneath the bars is sums to
one what we see And these dashed lines are
[SPEAKER_00]: the 95% confidence intervals What we see
is that we have the same basic error,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that red number in these first
three approaches for the organic Basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the same story for the conventional which
is on the bottom panel here But our V and
[SPEAKER_00]: IR organic matter that those maps those
cluster maps really improves the precision
[SPEAKER_00]: of our estimates and we also see that our
histograms are much narrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a much narrower spread and You
know, the values are all the same because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's we're resampling the same pool a
thousand times But so this was good we
[SPEAKER_00]: were pretty excited to see that So the
next step then is okay Well, we can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better mean estimate for the field But can
we use all of that data all those sample
[SPEAKER_00]: points to improve our prediction of soil
carbon across the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show you the simplest
approach that we use to do that Which was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically kind of repeating what we did
before but instead of randomly choosing 12
[SPEAKER_00]: we tried to optimize that the 12
calibration sample collection so What we
[SPEAKER_00]: did was we took those k-means clusters and
we just took the mean value for yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: mean value for black blue Etc and then the
closest neighbors in terms of values to
[SPEAKER_00]: select a calibration set and I weighted
that selection By the proportional area
[SPEAKER_00]: covered by each cluster So once you do
that, then you can develop a very simple
[SPEAKER_00]: regression equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have carbon stocks as y and then your
X variable is the organic matter as
[SPEAKER_00]: measured by your V and IR on the go and
you can then use that relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict that each one of those 2,000
points in the field with the carbon stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: would be and So this is the maps that you
get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using our hundred cores to predict
as measured and then interpolating what
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic carbon stocks would be for the
top 30 centimeters This is for the full 75
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter profile down here this bottom
panel and then this is our prediction so
[SPEAKER_00]: these are where our 12 points were that
were selected and then we just use the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between organic matter and
carbon stocks at those 12 points and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we Expanded that across the field and as
you can see visually the maps are very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar Especially for the topsoil fairly
similar for the subsoil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we notice is that in the subsoil
our Prediction is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of a linear transformation
But in reality, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that are driving carbon stocks
in the subsoil So this approach works
[SPEAKER_00]: really well for topsoil and this is the
values for the organic field You can see
[SPEAKER_00]: our R squareds 0.54 there, which is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conventional was even better as 0.68
That's only for 12 soil cores being
[SPEAKER_00]: collected and paying somebody $4 a hectare
so about 40 to 50 bucks to go across this
[SPEAKER_00]: field with the tractor And so that's
really good But we're only at point one
[SPEAKER_00]: three down here for the subsoil and it was
better in the conventional side Which I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have time to go into the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was point four eight, but this was
pretty pretty impressive to us And these
[SPEAKER_00]: little bubble plots are just a relative
error so for each of the points we We try
[SPEAKER_00]: so we predicted back at each of the points
that we didn't use in our calibration set
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a validation estimate Okay,
so that's basically it I'm just gonna wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: up here But in summary we see that rotary
cores are the preferred tool for if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go out and collect soil samples and
rocky soils and that because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship covariance between organic
matter and bulk density and because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Distinction between factors that affect
bulk density and factors that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon concentration We want to report our
carbon stocks on a mass basis And then in
[SPEAKER_00]: the second part we see that this visual
and near-infrared proximal sensing tool is
[SPEAKER_00]: really useful for predicting soil carbon
stocks in the surface, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: good for the subsurface and I think what's
needed is really for people to improve our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of those processes that are
driving subsoil carbon dynamics and link
[SPEAKER_00]: that into our You know into into some of
these tools so for example what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on is developing a Equation that
relate that describes the whole profile
[SPEAKER_00]: But has different parameters that control
subsoil carbon versus the topsoil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use that But it's a continuous
function and you could use that function
[SPEAKER_00]: interpolate that across the whole field to
predict the subsoil carbon more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately, hopefully So with that that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to say thanks to everybody who
helped me which are many I'm grateful,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd be happy to answer any questions
if you have any so thanks Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so so basically the question was can we
relate this to climate smart farming yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so so the idea is climate smart farming
are those practices that reduce emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: of greenhouse gases from urban operation
and The other component of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully store carbon from the atmosphere
in the soils Right and so the the way this
[SPEAKER_00]: is related is Those practices that are
storing carbon in the soils or maybe those
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are causing carbon to be
lost from the soil such as tillage We
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know the magnitude of those
changes and in order to monitor those
[SPEAKER_00]: changes we need to find better ways to
measure the soil carbon stock and That's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's was the whole idea behind those
questions for Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sam got three questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much my my first question
is Your part one you said that the mass
[SPEAKER_02]: base is the best reporting source carbon
socks Yeah, but then in part two you talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about subsoil as a function of depth Yeah,
and so I'm wondering if one you can speak
[SPEAKER_02]: about that me what seems to be like a
disconnect there to Is there a thing
[SPEAKER_02]: economics?
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of this that you could touch on
like how much money is It per sample when
[SPEAKER_02]: you consider the fact of the you consider
the cost of the BNIR machinery or versus
[SPEAKER_02]: the traditional you know soil analysis and
then So to answer the question about why
[SPEAKER_00]: am I talking about subsoil in the second
part I did that so it wasn't confusing
[SPEAKER_00]: usually when you tell people that you're
talking about 300 kilograms of soil per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared They don't know what you're
talking about But what I did is I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: all the data that I did in the second part
was actually I was working with numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: that were on a mass basis So it's roughly
equivalent the topsoil in this case was
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly equivalent to zero to thirty
centimeters But in fact it was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent 300 kilograms of soil per meter
squared the carbon that was contained in
[SPEAKER_00]: that massive soil at a red field And for
the subsoil is to 650 kilograms So and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the second component about cost
that's really a question So the this
[SPEAKER_00]: company that we work with various they
they quote four to five dollars per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare for this service Obviously need to
be where they're where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's other things that go into
that But that's that's fairly cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there's other agronomic
benefits to this other than just wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: To know what your carbon stock is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organic matter is important for
fertility, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have high organic matter,
you may not need to put down as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen It affects other properties of
the soil response to pesticides things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The I don't know if you're interested
in this but there's the cost component of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rocky soil stuff as well The road
record is actually not that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive It takes a little bit longer to
collect the soil, but as you can imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: collect a soil sample But as you can
imagine if you have to try five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: times to get one sample with a hammer core
And then the sample that you get isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exactly worth it Yeah,
so building on Sam's question early in
[SPEAKER_01]: your remarks you talked about there being
a potential Economic benefit to farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for carbon sequestration in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: How might that model work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they There's some some advances
that have been made with on that
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best example that I
know of But basically they have a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: fleet of private contractors that go out
and do what I do Which is so a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment on each individual farm and
they have these five-year monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: programs where they have to send someone
back out to check their fields every once
[SPEAKER_00]: a year for five years and then they report
that and They are able are given a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money depending on how much
carbon is Being added to the soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: removed and there's a whole lot more
issues that have to do with that So I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned permanence is one issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, you're doing something that
works for a few years But then someone
[SPEAKER_00]: comes through and undoes all of your hard
work So that's a big problem But there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another problem which is what about the
people that were already doing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing the whole time They were cover
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't using much tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really trying to build organic
matter in their soils If they're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point, it's actually harder to
keep putting carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you Deal with that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the issues that
they're trying to figure out but they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just went through with it in Australia
and You know so that there's I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: hurdles are other largely political,
but there's also some real methodological
[SPEAKER_00]: Considerations that need to be figured
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might add your Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just was in Albany and there's
a person in the assembly who has proposed
[SPEAKER_03]: a bill to look into giving tax credits to
farmers for soil carbon sequestration and
[SPEAKER_03]: also for not deforesting their forests and
so and They we met with them and they they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know all these although Complicated
issues that Jeff has talked about so we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to work with them and there is
$50,000 just came the newest New York
[SPEAKER_03]: State budget came in and there's $50,000
allocated just to exploring the tax credit
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question Yeah, I mean
certainly there's the very immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: practical value of okay Well, I know what
the organic matter is in this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: field I might have had a good sense of it
anyway, but you know, I guess here's an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of Something that might be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know if you have a sense Where you
have these very deep soil carbon profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna change how the soil responds
for crop growth And they're also going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change how the soil responds Yeah,
I guess just crop growth in general so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna affect management and so this
is very useful tool for the farmer to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out and say I'm gonna put less fertilizer
maybe in these higher organic matter sites
[SPEAKER_00]: one potential application Another
potential application is well,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're seeing that and I guess I'm
not sure if we can see it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but That when I was analyzing the data was
very clear to me that the Field that was
[SPEAKER_00]: organically managed which has a cover has
some sort of plant growing on it on all
[SPEAKER_00]: year round And then there's right next to
it was this field that was bearing winter
[SPEAKER_00]: the conventionally managed field and what
I saw is that there was a very significant
[SPEAKER_00]: decline in carbon stocks in the surface on
the areas that were sloped in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventionally managed side, which I
attribute just solely to erosion So we're
[SPEAKER_00]: having these redistribution processes and
I mean that you know Just seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence may be encouraging for somebody
to adopt a cover cropping practice But
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't thought about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I thought I made their question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So for someone safe who practices no
till yeah, would they find actually and
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to know how much carbon stock I
had would they find the use of this be an
[SPEAKER_02]: IR machine that drags actually creates I
guess some small torch furrows depending
[SPEAKER_02]: on how deep you go But they find that
objectionable with that somehow corrupt
[SPEAKER_02]: their their management system and affect
their That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so really I mean,
it's we're really talking about the top
[SPEAKER_00]: five centimeters of soil So I lost my
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically that that time is not going
great deep into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Minimally just disturb disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's yeah, so I guess It may be
some degree of an issue and certainly one
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is that you get poorer results I
think in part so I showed that we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: the R square root of point five four for
the Organic field for the top so carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stock prediction and it was point six
eight for the conventional side And I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that is actually largely because our
calibration wasn't very good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic side We had all this weak pressure
and in fact interferes with the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument operates But yeah, it'll be
probably a personal question for the
[SPEAKER_00]: no-tillers if they feel like it's too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's a great question I so we've
been trying for years now this this these
[SPEAKER_00]: data were actually collected in 2012 We've
been trying ever since then to get yield
[SPEAKER_00]: data from this this farmer cooperator
Great guy, but he just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he hasn't been able to get us the yield
data He has it so we really wanted to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: that in as another covariate and we have
another field where I I did actually In
[SPEAKER_00]: New York where we did a similar study and
I actually did use the yield data And I we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have the high-resolution organic
matter data So, you know, it was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem mismatch problem But I didn't
actually find as much of a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between the yield and our measured soil
carbon As I was hoping but it you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be nice to have the higher resolution
data to really play around with that All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, thanks so much Jeff great.
