[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Don, for such a kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much, everyone,
for coming here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's such a high-demanding labor in
the field right now, but thanks to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rain that it can gather people,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main goal of my research is only
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trying to breed switchgrass to be
resistant to diseases caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: bifuricirrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the topic here that I put is pretty
simple, that the switchgrass versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: bifuricirrhizae, which is a fungal
pathogen, a challenge in breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I have been presenting you
about switchgrass for so many years and so
[SPEAKER_00]: many times now, but you may think that
switchgrass is still out of your circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just out of your everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, it's not, because the first
picture, this is a switchgrass that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: taking this picture right in front of
Cornell Health Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was planted in the slope,
right in front of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switchgrass has been used for
preventing the soil erosion pretty well in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the second pictures,
can you guess where is this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Stewart Park, one of your favorite
places in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was planted in just the side of the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switchgrass has been used for the
landscape decoration quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, switchgrass has been
introduced as a forest purpose crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2000, switchgrass has been
introduced as one of the biomass candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: by Department of Energy as a biomass crop
because of its high yield and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: good in terms of greenhouse gas emission
capacity right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very well, it's a native grass
to North America and it's very well
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted across the latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's separate into upland switchgrass
and lowland switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next picture is a comparison
between the upland and lowland
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your left hand side is a upland and
on your right hand side is a lowland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, upland is well adapted to the
cold wind, like cold winter right around
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lowland is well adapted into the
higher moisture area and also provided
[SPEAKER_00]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another difference is the Ploy D level are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That upland is normally off the Ploy and
lowland is normally that of Ploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just, just a general idea,
if you walked in the field, so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: separate it by just the colors of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the lowland type is normally
blueish green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this difference, it's also a
difference in terms of the resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, after domestication in 1940,
1970s, there are only about 1700
[SPEAKER_00]: publication of switchgrass and little of
them, just only 28 of them is related to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though John mentioned that there's
lots of disease in switchgrass,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as rust and trachnos, and of course
the disease by biparous oryce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get back to our basic pan
pathology triangle that to confer the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The host, which is switchgrass that I
already introduced to you, was attacked by
[SPEAKER_00]: a pathogen and in this case is biparous
oryce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biparous oryce is an ascomyces fungus that
it's a necrotrophic pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to present in general, if we want to
emphasize the importance of the disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always put the worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, switchgrass, I'm sorry,
of course biparous oryce also has the
[SPEAKER_00]: worst case of this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it killed two to three million people
in India during the Bengal famine in 1943.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, because these can cause the
disease in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pathogen also cause the disease
in switchgrass also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause two diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is biparous seed rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name suggested, it reduced the
germination of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though that seeds can germinate,
this pathogen can infect the shoot and the
[SPEAKER_00]: root of the seeds also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can, these are the picture of the
hyphae and the cornidae, which is a sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: sport of this pathogen on the seed
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disease is biparous leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it causes the necrotic lesions on the
leaves like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can reduce the yield up to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge amount if we consider to
use switchgrass for biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of management of the disease,
we need to understand the life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen before we make any decision
which way we're gonna manage the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And biparous oryce, it's the seed and
soil-borne pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the first inoculum of the disease is
from the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was introduced to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, the hyphae of these
pathogen can grow into the soil and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and overwintering within the crop residual
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, it can spread the cornidae
spore into the mature plant and cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last angle of this triangle is
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best environment for these
pathogen to cause the disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's here in New York with
the prolonged high humidity and high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature during summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the perfect home for this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I work with this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I pick the breeding as a
management method over other approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: that, okay, if it's a fungal disease,
why don't we just spray, apply the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide to the field or fumigate the
soil as the soil-borne pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can do that, but it's
pricey, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we consider using switchgrass for
biomass production and we try to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the input as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another solution is because it's a
seed-borne pathogen, why don't we just
[SPEAKER_00]: soak the seed with the fungicide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I show you that these fungus
can grow on the seed surface, but this
[SPEAKER_00]: also has been proved that it can be inside
the seed tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may not be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is just the cultivation
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we can plow the soil to disrupt
the life cycle of the disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because switchgrass is a perennial
crop, so this is not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another concern about these switchgrass is
the target environment for switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in marginal land, such as the
reclaimed my area, that we try to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the competition between food and fuel and
crops to grow in a good land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the target environment here,
that it has low nutrient, high heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: and high acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst place to plant
switchgrass, but that's the place that we
[SPEAKER_00]: pick for planting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I pick the method of
breeding to manage this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the content today I already introduced
you the background of the host
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass, the pathogen of the bifurcate
oryxii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make a selection, I set up the
screening method first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for bifurcate seed rot, I basically
just soak the seed with the inoculum and
[SPEAKER_00]: compare with the seed with just the
control one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set up the screening method based on
these variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the first week shows the
highest germination, but that is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: date that I should collect the data,
because do you remember that these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen can infect the shoot and the root
of the newly early germinated seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can drop the germination during
the week three here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pick the week four to evaluate these
disease and to screen the resistant with
[SPEAKER_00]: this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disease is the bifurcate leaf
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two options here, like to screen
in seedlings or to screen in mature
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked the seedlings one because I can
handle it in greenhouse like any time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also can increase the number or
increase the replicates as many as I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use at least 1000 seedlings or 2000
per cycle for screening that it will take
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of land to produce in the field for
mature plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic method for screening this is
to, I screen the resistant to bifurcate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf spot in four weeks old seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray it, cover with a clear plastic bag
for 24 hours, release it, and I set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: I determine the condition when I'm gonna
evaluate the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what concentration I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the score that I used to
evaluate the disease resistant from 0% to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% as like 100, the copper, the whole
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two options to just evaluate at
only one day or as a percent leaf coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: by the lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can use the area under disease
progress curve along with from day one to
[SPEAKER_00]: day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that there's a very high
correlation between the one day at day
[SPEAKER_00]: seven to that 10 days value at around 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the screening method will be just
evaluate at the day seven only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use this criteria and I use the
highest concentration to screen this to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the intensity that you have to
survive from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point I was wondering if the
seed that was inoculated before that can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive from those pathogens can also
increase the resistance when they grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: as seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on that experiment I found that
there's no correlation between the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance of these two diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this no correlation,
I use this no correlation to set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this information to set up the
breeding scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's move into the third one that I
make the actual selection based on these
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I use a recurrent phenotypic
selection for two cycles of selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the fact that these two
resistance has no correlation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I separated into resistant, bifuric seed
rot and bifuric leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made for two cycles of selection and at
the end of cycle two I taste the
[SPEAKER_00]: reciprocal taste between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that's selected for bifuric seed
rot also got the gut spray by the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: spray when it was in seedlings also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because Shelter and Cabin Rock show
pretty well adapted to New York and high
[SPEAKER_00]: yield in New York state, I make the
selection based on these two population,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is upland switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce the half zip seeds in greenhouse
and in field nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also produce a, so I made a selection
for the Cabin Rock and Shelter,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, which is an upland type so I can
produce it in the field easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also produce a half zip seeds of the
cantaloupe in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also because cantaloupe is a, so I use
cantaloupe as a lowland representative in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case to have an idea like what is the
resistance in the lowland should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally when we make a selection,
it's good to know how heritable the trait
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I evaluate the heritability
based on the individual and based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: half zip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results showing that for the
resistant to bifuric seed rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cantaloupe switchgrass showing pretty
high, moderate to high heritability at .5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that I made that actual
selection, which is a Cabin Rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's showing at .3, which is also moderate
heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when you get this number,
before you make the selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had hope that you can get some gain
from this selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I make some gain from this
selection This graph represent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Y axis represent the percent
germination and each pair of the bar graph
[SPEAKER_00]: represent each cycle of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your left hand side is the response
from the Cabin Rock and your right hand
[SPEAKER_00]: side is the Shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see at the Cabin Rock first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you remember that I got moderate
heritability, so I should have some
[SPEAKER_00]: progress here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow box bar is the control seed and
the blue bar is the inoculated seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, for the base cycle,
the cycle zero that never be selected
[SPEAKER_00]: before, this is significantly different
between control and the inoculated one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the inoculated one has a reduction in
the germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between the control and
the inoculated one still persists in cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: one also, but these differences between
the control and the treatment one was
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing into non significantly different
within cycle two, which is good that,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, you get the good result out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The similar trend is also happening with
the Shelter that the base population still
[SPEAKER_00]: have the significantly different between
the control and the treatment one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with just one cycle of selection,
that gap was significantly different at
[SPEAKER_00]: all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this gap between the control
and the inoculated one, I plot this gap as
[SPEAKER_00]: a percent germination reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the bar, the more resistant this
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, the trend is very obvious
that from cycle zero to cycle two in Cabin
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock, it's dropped like this, which means
that it's increased the resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The similar trend also happened in
Shelter, too, that is dropped,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has a variation here, but it's
already different than the base population
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this huge improvement on percent
germination reduction, the percent genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: gain between cycle zero and cycle two,
cycle zero and cycle two here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's over 100%, but it's around 60% per
cycle of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also around 50% per cycle of
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Shelter also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on these percent genetic gains,
I can calculate the liability of
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability, which is the realized
heritability in this case of the binary
[SPEAKER_00]: trait like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got .2 here and .3 here,
which is acceptable moderate heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a plant breeder, I'm so proud of
this result that, okay, I got something
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this, but what about, do you
remember another disease, the bifurcate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like, so I got this result,
so I hope I get something from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the similar step to first
evaluate the heritability of that
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to bifurcate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, am I dreaming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it zero zero non-heritability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent like three years on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't give up that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I gave up already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, the first evaluation of
the heritability estimate was done in
[SPEAKER_00]: seven trays with three replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to change the inoculation
method from just the hand spray to the
[SPEAKER_00]: airbrush that can produce a more
consistent small drop of the inoculum that
[SPEAKER_00]: can firmly attach to the leaf well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also tried to fit just from 125
hapsip proteins across seven trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fit it into just one tray and just
discard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of them just use 44 hapsip of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried lots of combinations up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent almost a year on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, all of them are zero or
non-significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very good news for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't trust the result from this
heritability estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because come on, that's just the estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about if I just stop and to make
selection based on these techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result of my stubbornness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That none of them looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they copying the result?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them making any progress out of
the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to make the taste cross,
to go back to your basic genetics class,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back to your first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make the taste cross, I make a cross of
the resistant by resistant, resistant by
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible, susceptible by resistant,
and resistant by resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the basic textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that all of them, these are
the histogram of the progeny of each
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, the resistant, resistant,
resistant, susceptible, and each cross up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top here is a caping rock progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower here is a shelter progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these graphs showing almost
normally distributed with just unique
[SPEAKER_00]: model pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no multiple peaks in this
segregation in this histogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can conclude that these resistance
should be controlled by multiple alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: with the small effects of each allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's no significant
difference between the reciprocal cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can conclude that there's no linked
inheritance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, even when I try to compare
between these groups of the cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: only the resistant by resistant is
differently different from the susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: by susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference is expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also expect that the one that got
the resistant in the cross, resistant by
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible, and resistant by susceptible
by resistant, should be different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible by susceptible also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't show that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the conclusion from this selection,
based on the different trend in the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, that the top bar is a screening
for the bifurcate seed rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower result is resistant to
bifurcate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there's no trend here,
like flat trend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the resistant to bifurcate seed
rot, there's a huge trend here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it reduce here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light blue bar here representing the
population that was selected for bifurcate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although there's a reduction here,
there's no significantly different between
[SPEAKER_00]: these with the base population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I made significant
progress in the resistant to bifurcate
[SPEAKER_00]: seed rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't make any progress in the
bifurcate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not all the bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because do you remember the back,
the previously that I mentioned that these
[SPEAKER_00]: disease was inoculated firstly in the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the seeds carry the pathogen into
the field at the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this at least a good news that I can
reduce the primary inoculation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: field at the beginning, that it's overall
gonna reduce the incidence of bifurcate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf spot in the field in the later year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the explanation of the no
progress in resistant to bifurcate leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be the low natural pressure of
these, or this is a complex trait that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work with the octoploids with grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two cycles of selection may not be
enough to push these to be more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the worst case is there might not be
the resistant in this population that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the conclusion for this part of
my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this you confirm that there's no
correlation between these two resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can give an idea that in future
we can make a selection based on these two
[SPEAKER_00]: traits like separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point of my result,
I was at my fourth year already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in my shoes, so you know how
it feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't feel discouraged,
actually a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to learn what's wrong with the
resistant to bifurcate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though this bifurcate leaf
spot is one of the major disease in rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are only four publications about
the resistant in the rice population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is quite, I don't know what's wrong
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's only four papers of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most recent paper was trying to
identify the resistant in three
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used snips, they can confirm the
13 snips marker that linked to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that paper they just stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to dig a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in that paper, in that research,
they used the near isogenic line between
[SPEAKER_00]: the indica and the temperature pontica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on that, I just want to know
what are the resistant genes that link to
[SPEAKER_00]: these markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the linkage disequilibrium in indica is
around 100 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the LD for the temperature pontica is
200 kb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just used the 200 kb linkage
disequilibrium here to just find what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes that link to these 13 snips
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just searched in the phytosome
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that there are 278 genes that
linked to these 13 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of them are annotated,
another half is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, most of the frequent
heat that was showing to me, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: leucine rich repeat family protein and the
nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: here, all showing the most out of 278 one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two proteins are well known for
its function as an artin because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another most heat protein is the protein
peroxidase precursor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peroxidase is quite important in terms of
the resistance for this pathogen to this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen because the biprase RIC is a
necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it used the programmed cell data that
related to reactive oxygen species in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of the susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diligent is also important in terms of the
lignin synthesis that it prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: infection for these disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MYB protein, it's very well known for
its resistant capacity that it respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: most biotic and abiotic stress in general
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on these 287 genes, I just pulled
up all of the sequence and blast back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: so because these based on the RICE data,
so I pull out of these gene sequence and
[SPEAKER_00]: blast back to the switchgrass database and
I found that the top 10% score of those
[SPEAKER_00]: blast hits, there's still like 1400 genes
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least I have some hope that there
should be some resistant genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I try to dissect the
resistant to biprase leaf spot by using
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome Y association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back to the first step that I
would not working with the seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with the mature plant that
I've got a chance to evaluate these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mature plant that was already a genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the population that I use is a
switchgrass Norton association panel that
[SPEAKER_00]: consists of 66 population that both the
commercialized cultivars from switchgrass
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of them are also the natural
collection of the switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those population, we plant five
to six seeds for each population into
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, I have 479 genotypes out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2016, we planted in Ithaca and in
Phillipsburg in Pennsylvania for three
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just last year, we was just planted in
Rucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but these data, it's only from last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They data because I only have one year
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was having only one chance in two
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, with the 66 population
479, I just want to, the goal was to
[SPEAKER_00]: screening to just identify what's the best
candidate for the resistant out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because all of these has been
genotypes already, what are the markers?
[SPEAKER_00]: The SNPs marker that links to potential
resistant gene through the biparate lip
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first, it's the easiest way to
evaluate a disease, just walk through a
[SPEAKER_00]: field, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I evaluate by just using my eyes,
by evaluating with the scope from zero to
[SPEAKER_00]: five in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results showing like this,
that each, so I represent these results in
[SPEAKER_00]: 66 population, each bar represents 66
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coded by the different ecotype,
the upland and lowland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these order based, and these bar order
based on the mean from two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, there's no like,
there's no similar trend between the based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the mean from two locations with the
mean from just New York and mean from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's showing me that there's a huge
environmental effects to the resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: biparate lip spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come up with the, so I try to
evaluate, I try to eliminate those
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental effect by just taking the
lip sample back to the lab and sprayed it
[SPEAKER_00]: and inoculated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did into two assay, in the leaf
detachment assay and the leaf detachment
[SPEAKER_00]: assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the leaf detachment assay,
I basically just cut two to five
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first they lie, sprayed it,
like cover seven days and evaluate it and
[SPEAKER_00]: also like scan each leaf, oops,
oops, oops, oops, oops, scan each leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: use image analysis to like to detect the
lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may notice that like I use the
disease, it's in the dot, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: the black dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like, so I can based on these
pictures, I can extract lots of data out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that, just the black dot or just the
overall necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this one, I show you the overall
necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That showing and that result is pretty
high correlated with my eye data,
[SPEAKER_00]: eye evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that it's not a good like
candidate from the result that I give you
[SPEAKER_00]: like non-significant result previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another evaluation that I did was using
the leaf disc assay that I just core the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf into two, yeah, like one centimeters
and put in the water and take pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and use image analyze, image data to
extract each leaf circle and evaluate like
[SPEAKER_00]: the similar things also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a high correlation at point
seven with like correlate with my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on these, I can evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I evaluate the brust and irritability
and this time it's showing very high brust
[SPEAKER_00]: and irritability at point seven,
point five, skip this one, and point three
[SPEAKER_00]: and point six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skipped this one because you remember
that there's a huge environmental effects
[SPEAKER_00]: here that you have the high irritability
in each location.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you consider two locations,
where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I have this high
irritability from each evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, but when I try to just rank it
by the DTIA is the result from the
[SPEAKER_00]: detached leaf with the image analysis one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I rank this by based on the detached
leaf result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that there's still like no
trend with the this leaf and no trend with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mean of two locations from two
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this showing that there's no
correlation even within the evaluation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the resistant to bifurcate leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no correlation between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high correlation is between my eyes
and the vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond the resistant to bifurcate leaf
spot, there's also no correlation with
[SPEAKER_00]: other biomass traits such as the mineral
content trend, the digestibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell wall concentration, or the
ethanol yield from the dry biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the fact that there's no
correlation based on this, the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the GWAS, I was trying to just feed
it as by itself, by its single trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just a combination of the lots of
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also include the first three
principle component that can explain
[SPEAKER_00]: around 15% variation in this population
and also use a kinship metric as a random
[SPEAKER_00]: effect too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the LD, the linkage disequilibrium
that give the idea that how wide is the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that link to the marker that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this population is 20 kilobase
pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned earlier, that the way
that I feed the GWAS is I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: just feed the single trait of itself and
the combination of many traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the detached leaf, from the leaf,
from the field and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than 90% of my GWAS give me
non-significant peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even though some of them just give me
the very, very unreliable QQ plot that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them left the panel too early,
some of them just like smoothly normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't show me significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them still show me like some
whole, that's still something in my
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also based on, because I have like
479 population, I subset those 479
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes into like many, many groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is just I use like the whole
thing with the combination of the detached
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf and this leaf and the maximum in New
York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use maximum the value from the field
evaluation, which is the most severe in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, because none of the blap or
none of the mean from the field evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: show me the significant results of the
GWAS at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the maximum because Washington
in pathology suggested me to do this that,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you don't need to think as a plant
breeder all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to think as a plant pathology
sometime that if you have the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same field that you have three
replicates, one of them show no symptom,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them show the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you just pick the worst one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like consider that's the worst case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I consider using the maximum
value here in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's showing something here that some
significant peak here is related to
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant protein, which is very good in
terms of the resistant to bifurcate leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: MYB, which is related to the biotic
antibiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, the ring finger,
this is related to a programmed cell date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DST, the glutathione S-transferase is
also related to the antioxidant
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important peak here is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's not like Mike GWAS didn't
provide the very Manhattan plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the significant peak like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this showing me the most interesting
one because the cytochrome P450 is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only one peak that overlap with the blast
result that I got from rice, that I used
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene from rice and I blast back to the
Swiss grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the only one that overlap with
that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the importance of this phytochrome
P450 is synthesized for triterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triterpene is also well known for the
antifungal activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most well known triterpene is a
medicine in oath that is also resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: act as antifungal activities too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another subset is the tetraploid in this
Swiss grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tetraploid showing, the only GWAS
showing the significant from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid subset is the maximum value in
the field in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's showing that it links with the
programmed cell date protein and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that induce the necrosis one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another subset is the subset of the
lowland that also shows the antifungal
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's linked with, this peak links
with the nucleotide binding side using
[SPEAKER_00]: rich repeat protein, which is also well
known for acting as an R protein that
[SPEAKER_00]: detect the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the upland, there's showing only
one peak here that link to DW40,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though there's no study directly say
that this is related to any pan disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is very important for
bio-authenticity for MYB protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also linked to the pan stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this, although as you know
that I have most of my GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: non-significantly different, didn't give
me a significant result, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: significant GWAS that I have here,
there's no overlap peaks out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: population at all, which is, it's not an
ideal result, but at least it's better
[SPEAKER_00]: than just zero heritability and
non-progress from the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's showing up the key,
there's showing up that these,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I consider overall of these GWAS,
they're showing up the key genes that link
[SPEAKER_00]: to these markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is reasonably, that can confer the
resistance to this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still missing some genes that I
expect to see, like dilatant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: linked to the lignin synthesis,
the peroxidase, MLO-like proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the only peaks in on chromosome B from
the 479 here, it's linked with the blast
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on these, let's get back to the
goal for the study of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first goal is trying to identify the
most resistant genotypes or population in
[SPEAKER_00]: this 66 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you remember that none of the
phenotypic approaches here has correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I cannot make the conclusion
that, okay, this one is the best out of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them in all criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I need to, if I need to put,
if I need to pick the most, the best one
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, I will pick SW805, because it's
always on the top 10% of this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the multi-trade GWAS here really helps
me to reveal some of the, SNPs marker that
[SPEAKER_00]: is linked to the resistant gene
reasonably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, it's the end of my
reading part that I tried so hard to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't forget that we still can manage
these disease by another approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this recent year, there's a trend
to implement silicon to rise, to be
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to bipolar leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been proved that this silicon
can coat the seed, I'm sorry, can coat the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to prevent the attack of the
intrusion of this pathogen, like
[SPEAKER_00]: physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this silicon can trigger the
defense mechanism molecules such as
[SPEAKER_00]: jasmonic acid or salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, it's quite surprising that it's,
they also prove that the silicon can
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the taking over of the ethylene
production from rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, and based on these,
there's a study to screen the gene in
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe swiss grass, and they found
that there are at least two key genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: translocating for silicon in swiss grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: LSI1 and LSI2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on this knowledge, I had some
hope that, okay, even though I didn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: any progress from the selection,
I can make progress from just applying
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon to swiss grass and make it more
resistant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a concern about the applying
silicon to swiss grass too, because swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: grass was aimed to use for the biomass,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically want to burn it or turn it
into ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to burn it, the higher silicon
amount can melt at 500 to 700 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius and create the slag like this that
can clog the heating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like the implement of silicon
into swiss grass is also a concern too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just the basic idea of how
much silicon in the tissue of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, like swiss grass is
already higher than this cantus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also another biomass crop too,
but it's still lower than rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just add a little bit more
silicon may not hurt this, but this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result showing that there's no effect
of the silicon amendment to the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to either diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to mix the silicon powder with the
salt, with the soil and just plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: swiss grass there and taste the bifurcate
seed there, taste the bifurcate leaf spot
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no significant effect on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yellow bar here represent the
silicon one and the blue bar is a control
[SPEAKER_00]: one, even though it looks like
significantly different, but when we taste
[SPEAKER_00]: it statistically, it's not like
significant different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, okay, there may be like some soil
mixing problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to just water the silicon
solution to them too and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement between silicon and the
control one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I think I'm cursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no improvement, but there's
some explanation on these two that there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be low retention of this silicon in
the, I didn't use the soil, I used a
[SPEAKER_00]: corneal peak-like medium, so there may be
low retention on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like there's no biological,
like for the resistant to bifurcate seed
[SPEAKER_00]: dots, it's like watering silicon when it
seeds, it may not have any biological
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, like the stage that I used for
screening for bifurcate leaf spot may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be like enough, it may not be appropriate
for the silicon to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the tissue already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to keep in mind that this
result, it's a greenhouse result,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it cannot be inferred the effect of
this silicon amendment in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone want to try this,
you're welcome to continue this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall for my research, I would like
to conclude that as a plant reader,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty proud of the improvement of the
resistant to bifurcate seed dot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's increased like, come on,
60% and 50% of each cycle of selection is
[SPEAKER_00]: so high for the disease resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to admit that the resistant to
bifurcate leaf spots still need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: improved, and since the screening
techniques, and even though I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: screen in mature plants, it's still,
like those markers that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-trade, the DEWAS, cannot directly be
used for the genomic assisted selection
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still need to be validating a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, for silicon amendment,
we cannot infer the greenhouse result to
[SPEAKER_00]: the field result, so that might be the
future research again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I cannot stand here and live in
America for five years without the
[SPEAKER_00]: financial funding from the Development and
Promotion of Science and Technology from
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, and also I cannot be here and
make sense of my research without my
[SPEAKER_00]: committee member, Don Vann, Gary Bergstam,
and Neil Matson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I cannot plant out of those 500 of
those plants in the field every year
[SPEAKER_00]: without the help of the forest group,
Julie Hansen, and Jamie Crawford,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Crawford, and thanks to the member
group in Gary's lab for helping me with
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease part, and also the plant
material and the genotype data from Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: Kessler, and all of my SIP friends that I
cannot have all of this idea by just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lots of ideas from you all,
so thank you so much for having me here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and welcome for any questions,
and if you want to have any comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: very welcome to email me if I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: How expensive is the silicon amendment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like that might be an additional
objection.
[SPEAKER_00]: How expensive is silicon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil, I didn't follow the actual price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done work in container media,
and it would be like a 0.1 cent per six
[SPEAKER_03]: inch pipe, but I'm not a field person,
so I don't have to think through how to
[SPEAKER_03]: scale up your field, and you know there's
different ways of adding it, and one way
is actually using rice hulls or hatched
rice hulls, so I think the ideal is to use
these where our silicon already occurring
that's in waste streams that we can put
back into agricultural production.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken, if there are any additional
questions, feel free to come up and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to your president.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
