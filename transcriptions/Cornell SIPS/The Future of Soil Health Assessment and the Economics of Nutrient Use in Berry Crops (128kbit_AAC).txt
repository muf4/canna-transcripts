[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Laura McDermott speaking on behalf
of the Northeast SARE-funded Soil
[SPEAKER_03]: Management and Berry Crops as a Model for
Management Education Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 12th webinar in a series of
12, the final webinar, so I really am
[SPEAKER_03]: happy that we've got a good group,
and thank you for logging on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of you know your way around
this Adobe Connect classroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put a chat in that long, narrow box
right in the lower center.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are web links here for the webinar
archives in case you've missed any,
[SPEAKER_03]: and to Northeast SARE.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just on the apparently,
according to Kathy, there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that have not finished the Northeast
SARE demographics questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would really love everybody to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that we need to have done
for the grant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do, there's going to be more
information about this, but this is
[SPEAKER_03]: concluding the first year of this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: The webinars are part of a two-year
Northeast SARE professional development
[SPEAKER_03]: project, and we'll have more information
about the second year's work at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: this presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Kathy Heidenreich will also
discuss the post-test and the webinar
[SPEAKER_03]: evaluation that we'd like everyone to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone to complete at your leisure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, I think we'll move
into the second phase, the last
[SPEAKER_03]: educational presentation of the webinar
series.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Harold Van Ness will be giving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harold is the Professor of Soil and Water
Management and Chair of the Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Crop and Soil Sciences at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: His current research and extension
interests are in precision management of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, soil health, and space-time
statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today he's going to be speaking about
soil management using ecological
[SPEAKER_03]: principles and soil health management.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Harold, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can all hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this final webinar, I'd like to kind
of bring together some of the management
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches that we've discussed in the
past months and perhaps think about it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more at a conceptual level,
especially how we can bring ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: principles into sustainable barrier
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miguel Altieri defined it as the
application of ecological science to the
[SPEAKER_00]: study, design, and management of
sustainable agroecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecology, of course, relates to how
organisms interact with their environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even though agricultural systems
almost by definition are not natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, there's a lot we can learn from
natural systems, and that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable to agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can enhance the agricultural systems by
basically mimicking some of the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, especially how various
organisms interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be soil organisms like worms
or fungi, or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be plants, either our berry
plants, which we're primarily concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about, or other plants that might interact
with them, like maybe cover crops or mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that it encourages beneficial
biological interactions, synergies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and efficiencies, that it recycles
nutrients, energy, and carbon in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: external impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it kind of approaches multiple
tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this latter point, we mean that we
tend to bring in a lot of external inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: into agricultural systems, and most of the
time that's necessary to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: production potential that we're looking
for, but there's a lot of internal cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's a framework for
approaching agricultural management that
[SPEAKER_00]: is really much more knowledge intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a way, I think that's been the
purpose of this seminar, where we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed a lot of approaches that are not
simple, and there's often not very easy
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptive recipe-type answers,
but that need to bring in basically our
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of the system and how the
interactions within the system occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graph here shows five legs of a
table that represents natural ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these basically represent five
characteristics of natural ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be self-regulating,
they tend to be efficient, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse, they are generally
self-sufficient, and they are resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at those in a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about a natural
ecosystem, you have to keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems have evolved over the years
and basically have come up with what you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to call a successful formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to be efficient in terms of
energy, in terms of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and carbon, and they tend to cycle
quite efficiently within a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically very little waste
because one organism's waste is another's
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: In agricultural systems, we often have a
lot more waste and external losses,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for example, nitrate leaching or
runoff, that would be wasteful in a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural environment, and we have to
minimize those in a more managed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be diverse, above and below
ground biological activity, diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to checks and balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about soil organisms,
we have beneficial ones, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic organisms, and they tend to
keep each other in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above ground, we have different plant
organisms that also impact and compete
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other and basically provide a
balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be self-sufficient,
the only external inputs tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight, rain, and air, and not many of
these other external inputs that we
[SPEAKER_00]: normally see in agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they evolved basically to be efficient
and to basically take advantage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: limited resources that they have
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are self-regulating, they have
diverse ecological communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and severe disease or pest outbreaks tend
to be uncommon, again, because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and keeping the checks and
balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their populations tend to be dynamic and
continuously in flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, they tend to be
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many natural systems have been subjected
to extreme events, whether it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme precipitation like a hurricane or
extreme cold or extreme dryness,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that way they've basically adapted to
those kind of environments and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: built resiliency into their ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be damaged, but they tend to come
back more easily than a damaged ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question then is which of these can
we achieve in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to be realistic that
agriculture by its very design is not
[SPEAKER_00]: natural because we basically try to favor
one plant or a berry crop, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: over other plants, but we can still take
advantage of a lot of the principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to maybe contrast that a
little bit to sort of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional agricultural approach and how
many of us have learned about managing
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most dominant paradigm in agriculture
is more reactive management, short-term
[SPEAKER_00]: response to immediate problems that relies
on external interventions, and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're low on nitrogen,
then you apply nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an insect problem,
then you apply an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have weedy conditions, you apply an
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is dry, you irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is compacted, you use a
subsoiler or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes these problems can be
symptoms of deeper or more fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, maybe a poorly managed
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also tends to be a relatively
short-term approach to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might think of, in tilled systems,
we might think of tillage that way as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that we have a short-term benefit
from tillage, but in the longer term,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do damage to the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to contrast that, a more
agro-ecological approach is more proactive
[SPEAKER_00]: and looks more at the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is to develop internal
strength into the system that allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more efficient, more resilient,
and all those qualities that we'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: see in good agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to use strategies that
enhance mutualism and synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the, for example, of the soil
biota can enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae are one example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to be able to stress the pest
and enhance the beneficials and create
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and above ground conditions that
promote growth of healthy crops with
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the analogy that I often use when I
talk to students or stakeholders is the
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy with human health, which we've
used before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about proactive
long-term management, the analogy would
[SPEAKER_00]: be, to basically live a healthy lifestyle,
to eat healthy, say a high-fiber diet with
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and vegetables, not too much meat,
to exercise and basically live a lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: that's low stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically gives you internal strength
and health in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contrast there in terms of the more
reactive management would be more like
[SPEAKER_00]: getting sick or, say, getting a bacterial
infection and taking antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to do that at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you'd also like to do is you'd
like to be able to build that strength
[SPEAKER_00]: into the system over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about the human health,
eating a healthy meal, eating a salad or
[SPEAKER_00]: eating some fruits and vegetables or some
high-fat fiber breakfast doesn't overnight
[SPEAKER_00]: make you into a healthy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have a long-term commitment to
good diet and exercise to become healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and to build the strength in your body to
be able to withstand a diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the analogy is really very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to focus on at least having a
long-term strategy in managing your
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem, your agro-ecosystem,
to reduce the susceptibility to stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: build resiliency and strength in the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically captured in this graph
that you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's basically three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is this long-term preventive
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is a little bit shorter term,
sort of seasonal management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is the real
short-term reactive management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you start with the preventive
management, we can think of sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground component and a below ground
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about building healthy soils,
these are some of the management practices
[SPEAKER_00]: that we discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start out with assessing your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to improve the soil even before you
plant your berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the pH is corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add organic matter to build up the carbon
levels in the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce compaction problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those kind of things that are sort of
preventative, longer term management
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about above ground,
good crop selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select varieties that are resistant to
certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they are planted well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that that basically will
enhance the success of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this then will create soil and above
ground conditions for healthy plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a second level then, you might think of
sort of in-season management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more sort of planned in-season
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think in terms of integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically, you commit to a set of
practices that help you better manage
[SPEAKER_00]: pests in your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you commit to weekly field
inspections and scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look for diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also do some soil measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maybe keep track of the nitrate
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that that on a regular basis
is a commitment to monitoring your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, you may need to do some
reactive management.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to apply a pesticide,
whether it's organic or inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to correct some nutrient
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is sort of the immediate
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, going back to the human health,
that's more like taking some antibiotics
[SPEAKER_00]: or taking some cold medicine so that you
on the short term can reduce the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, what we have here is a range
of management approaches that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use to optimize our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to keep in mind is that we
have tended to focus more on the reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: management, but we need to make sure that
we plan ahead of time starting with site
[SPEAKER_00]: identification and site remediation to
also do the long-term preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show you an example of
this, and this actually relates to corn
[SPEAKER_00]: production in Kenya, but I think it's very
interesting results from a study from a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years ago by Marenia and Barrett,
and they are basically agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: economists here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they looked at
nitrogen response on lands that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of organic matter content or carbon
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in western Kenya where some
soils have been in production for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years, and they tend to have low
organic matter contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other soils that have been deforested
very recently, say in the last 5 or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, that still have a lot of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that when they
applied fertilizer, that the response to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer was much more favorable for the
soils that had a higher organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: content than the soils that had a very low
organic matter content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this line here is actually the price
of the fertilizer, which is 200 Kenyan
[SPEAKER_00]: shillings in this case per kilogram,
and so the soils that were very degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: and very low in organic matter didn't
actually even have a, provide a profit to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen application.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being that these soils had a
lot of other constraints because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: low in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may have had higher runoff,
they may have had compaction problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may have been more droughty,
and so you didn't actually get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: return on your investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on these better soils, you did get a
much higher return on your investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can think similarly for other crops
that if we have a low quality soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: unhealthy soil, that we're not going to
get as much return on our investments than
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have a high quality soil because
there are so many other constraints to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with when we have a low quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a few other examples of
ecological management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many composts, but not all, they suppress
root diseases when used in a potting mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also help fight off leaf
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compost, for example, can be actually
quite suppressive of all kinds of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because with the compost there's
a lot of beneficial organisms that help
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress the pathogenic organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, lower early season
nitrate levels decrease viability and
[SPEAKER_00]: competitiveness of weeds with small seeds
because these run out of nutrients more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So systems that are very high in nitrate
levels actually may enhance competition of
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable species, in this case seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, flea beetle pressure and
damage to cabbage is more severe on
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work from Dave Wolf here at
Cornell that found that when we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in poor health, that the insect
pressure tends to be much higher because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can't resist these kinds of
pressures as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, root rot severity of
vegetable crops is decreased by growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops and allowing sufficient time
for them to decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we refer to the term
biofumigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work by George Obawi in the plant
pathology department at Geneva,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many cover crops suppress plant
parasitic nematodes, also work from George
[SPEAKER_00]: Obawi's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of ecological principles
and mutualism that we can take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of when we use these more agroecological
approaches, and that reduces the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: these more reactive approaches which
typically means expensive inputs like
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us back to the soil health
test that Bob Schindlbeck discussed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past few months because the soil health
test is really about this more proactive
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term management approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about a quick test that allows
you to respond immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you may remember, we have physical,
biological, and chemical indicators that
[SPEAKER_00]: we use in a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure their values and we interpret
those values into a rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a way of saying, well,
if the aggregate stability is 26%,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that good or is that bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the rating scale from 0 to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main idea here is then to be able to
identify the constraints which are
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated in red here and to be able to
address these constraints, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: through more long-term sustainable
management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil health test basically is a
guide to longer-term soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about berry production,
we have to, as with any other crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to think about how do we actually
interpret those values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aggregate stability is 26%,
is that high or is that low?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also depends on what kind of a
crop that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, surface hardness or active
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we actually interpret these
numbers and how do we do that for berry
[SPEAKER_00]: production in particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed these scoring curves that
Bob discussed, and we have basically three
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is where more is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, generally with organic matter
or active carbon or aggregate stability,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more, the higher the number,
the better it is in terms of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other cases, we have less is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of that would, for example,
be a penetrometer reading where a high
[SPEAKER_00]: number is actually less favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have an optum, for example,
pH might be an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what a key point that we need to
keep in mind is that we've developed the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health test primarily for disturbed
systems, for vegetables, for field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that these interpretations,
these scoring curves would actually vary
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what kind of a system we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're dealing with berry systems,
they tend to be less disturbed and we
[SPEAKER_00]: might have different expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example is that some berry crops
actually do better under a lower pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: others under a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly that might be different than
something for a typical vegetable or field
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we need to think
about is how can we enhance and adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: these scoring functions and these
interpretations to a berry production
[SPEAKER_00]: system so that we can give better
management recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we had approached that with our
initial soil health test development was
[SPEAKER_00]: to either use a frequency distribution
from our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is we analyzed a lot of
samples from basically very low quality
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and very high quality soil and
everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically look at the
distribution and then develop a scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: function from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use expert opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literature values, for example,
we do know what an optimum pH is for many
[SPEAKER_00]: berry crops or for many vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can apply that directly to our
interpretation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we developed the soil health
test primarily for disturbed systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, and field crops and they would
need to be adapted to perennial systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to tweak those interpretation
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to necessarily change the
measurement methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change how we interpret the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just illustrates how we did that,
this approach of looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you measure a line of these,
a lot of soils from variable conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have some information on how the
crops perform on those soils, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: develop this distribution function and you
can interpret how, you know, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically high and what's low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this, for example, is for active
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're less than 400, you're
basically pretty low and if you're greater
[SPEAKER_00]: than 800, you're pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you might want to interpret
those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we then basically
developed these scoring curves by taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the normal distribution function and
turning that into a cumulative
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution function, which is just a
simple mathematical trick that you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: in Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you develop a scoring function
that helps you interpret your measured
[SPEAKER_00]: value here on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting that into a score and with the
low scores being in the red zone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: high scores being in the green zone and
the intermediate ones being in the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would need to happen if we want to
apply this framework to berry crops is we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to tweak some of these scoring curves
to make them more applicable to berry
[SPEAKER_00]: crops in general and perhaps to specific
crops, like for example, pH adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be needed depending on what
particular berry crops we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some final thoughts then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proactive management helps build
resiliency into the cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this relates to some of the very early
webinars we did where we talked about site
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, site remediation, investing in
compaction, remediation, adding organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, doing pH correction and all those
kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then secondly, we may need to do some
reactive management to optimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may involve fertilizer application
or sometimes pest control might be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both proactive and reactive management
are critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main point is that we've tended to not
put as much emphasis on the proactive
[SPEAKER_00]: management and more on the reactive
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing is an important component and
interpretations need to be refined for
[SPEAKER_00]: berry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say it's soil testing,
both the more conventional soil testing
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really nutrient testing as well
as the more comprehensive testing as we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Cornell soil health test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, organic matter is a key
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the life in the soil and it
supports a lot of the organisms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and that's what allows for this more
agro-ecological approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should keep in mind that organic
matter is not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't solve all the problems with
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in time, I will turn it
back to our moderator, Laura.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if people have questions
right now, if there's anything on your
[SPEAKER_03]: mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have a question maybe to
start us off with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those scoring functions, what volume of
testing, what volume of tests do you need
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to kind of have some level of
confidence and be able to make those
decisions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those scoring functions work for perennial
crop like berries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we close to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need just a bigger volume to
analyze?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get there from maybe where we
are which is that we need more
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretations or more information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to reinvent the wheel for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is important is that we have a better
understanding of what are more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate or let's say good levels for
some indicators and not so good levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some work in the past years with
the grape group here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Mortenson and Lailang Cheng and Alan
Lackso to apply this sort of health test
[SPEAKER_00]: to viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the needs are slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in viticulture, it's a little bit
more complex because often you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to be somewhat stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for most other berry crops,
I don't think that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the first step is to
basically to look at the current scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: functions and to see what might be
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a very obvious change would
be what's an optimum pH level for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular berry crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, of course, would vary depending on
whether it's blueberries or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit to not being an expert in this
area, but I know that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that because these are
more perennial systems that we may be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for different values of say active
carbon or organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best approach, I think, and in fact
that's what we're planning to do as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this grant, is to start collecting some
samples from berry fields that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: represent a range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we get samples
from some soils that we really know are
[SPEAKER_00]: not performing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have some samples from soils
that we know do perform very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at least we can start defining the
range and the boundary conditions for good
[SPEAKER_00]: versus bad soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's a matter of sitting down with
some experts and then coming up with good
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep in mind that the numbers
that you get out of a soil health test are
[SPEAKER_00]: a management guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides you insights like your blood
pressure or your cholesterol level for
[SPEAKER_00]: your human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do an exact interpretation,
but you can learn a lot from looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these soil health reports that allows you
to better manage your soil and your crops.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glenn Koehler from Maine asks,
are soil health tests ready for use in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2012 or still in development?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you could submit a sample
tomorrow if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have particular interpretations
for berry crops, but we are receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and we are providing results that
a professional could certainly interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what we're trying to do with this
grant is to help develop better
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretations for berry crops
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Oneida County is wondering what we
know about water management and its effect
[SPEAKER_03]: on berry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure whether I quite understand
the question, but what we do know is that
[SPEAKER_00]: both extremes are a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have too much water and then we
need to consider drainage because excess
[SPEAKER_00]: water creates a lot of problems,
denatrification, more pathogenic problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: root rot, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also be on the other end where
there may be drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation is certainly a more reactive
approach, but we can build a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: internal strength in the system by
creating a soil environment that is higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic matter content because organic
matter holds a lot of moisture that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: for deep rooting, so no compacted zones
that has correct pH throughout the profile
[SPEAKER_00]: because roots don't do well in acid
subsoils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can build a lot of strength in the
system by basically creating a very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: and extensive rooting system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I just want to add to Oneida
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week's Dr. Belinsky-Santos did talk a
little bit about fertility management and
[SPEAKER_03]: water management in terms of more
soil-less berry production, so maybe that
[SPEAKER_03]: would be of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy mentioned in the chat that that
webinar plus some material associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: it, she is going to be posting on the
website and sending a link to those of you
[SPEAKER_03]: who are on her email list, which I think
is everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy also sent out an email to folks
wondering if they had any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: unresolved questions from the berry
series, and now might be a time if anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: does have those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy, I don't know if anybody emailed you
back with anything about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, I didn't get any feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody with any burning
unresolved questions, but if anybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: any, it would be great to bring those out
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe Lee has something.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no pressure, Lee.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just all watching to see how quickly
you type.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Adobe Connect is supposed to allow us
to have, to be able to turn on each of
[SPEAKER_03]: your, if you had a headset, we could
independently allow you an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not tried that yet, but maybe in
some other setting we will try that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the challenge of the typing part,
but thanks for your patience, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lee's comment is about submitting
multiple samples, two from each of two
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The results are very interesting,
and yeah, I agree, Lee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've just begun working on it with
vegetable growers, and I did do a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: with some berry growers in a reduced-till
study, and it is not, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we think we know what's going on in the
soil, but it is really surprising when
[SPEAKER_03]: soil health tests come back and proves
that we don't know everything about it
[SPEAKER_03]: just from what we expect, but yeah,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Oneida County mentions the handouts
and website information, will be helpful,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is true, and I'm going to take it
that people are done with questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: so why don't we move into the very last
portion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Dr. Van Ness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy Heidenreich is now going to give us
a little summary and lay out the next
[SPEAKER_03]: phase of the project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks a lot, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Laura, and I'll ask everyone to
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just recovering from a cold,
so I sound a little bit like Donald Duck
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to do just briefly is to
review the purpose of the project with you
[SPEAKER_01]: and give you an idea where we are in the
timeline and where we'd like to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: here and how you might play a role in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issue that has been that commercial
berry growers in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally make standard fertilizer
applications based on crop age,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as Dr. Van Ness pointed out so aptly
today, it's a reactive sort of management
[SPEAKER_01]: versus proactive, and this is in spite of
the fact that for 10 years or more we have
[SPEAKER_01]: some very good research that indicates
that analysis-based fertilization programs
[SPEAKER_01]: really are more beneficial, both in terms
of dollars and cents and in terms of yield
[SPEAKER_01]: and plant health, and that soil health can
also have an impact, and soil health
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement techniques have also not been
adapted very widely among berry growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we have a concern about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started looking into why this
might be so, we discovered that ag
[SPEAKER_01]: educators, the folks who have been
participating in particular, are often
[SPEAKER_01]: called on to cover multiple commodities
and sometimes are actually operating
[SPEAKER_01]: outside their field of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a struggle to help berry
growers with soil and nutrient management
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, and then also with
interpretation of things like the Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health test results or the foliar
analysis results, and that we didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any comprehensive resources on this to
help people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Marvin Pritz and the team have put
together a two-year project to help
[SPEAKER_01]: provide some training both for ag
educators and for the berry growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this webinar series has actually
been year one of the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can check that off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked through the 12 webinars
together, and while you've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: through the webinars, we've been working
on resources that you will be able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: in grower training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next phase is where we're
hoping that it's your turn and that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: assist us by providing some training to
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to look at that in a
little more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we going to measure the
success?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at knowledge before
and after participating in the project to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what sort of changes may have
occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also going to look at
adoption and success of analysis-based
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient and soil management in years to
follow after the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had 72 educators when we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had various numbers of educators
throughout, and so we've accomplished the
[SPEAKER_01]: first goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second goal, we'd like to have 15
of you who've been willing to train to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually develop and deliver an outreach
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping that we'll get at least
10 growers at each or more at each
[SPEAKER_01]: training, and then that 50 of them will
participate in a soil and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: management health testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have complementary Cornell soil
health tests for 50 growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have complementary foliar analysis
tests for the same 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're hoping that educators who
sponsor training will work one-on-one with
[SPEAKER_01]: the growers to interpret the results and
to come up with some sort of a plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement on-farm, and then that the same
educators will collect feedback from the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers on how well they think it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about where we're going from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the webinar, I do have a
list of people we're missing demographics
[SPEAKER_01]: questionnaires from, and I'll be emailing
them and letting them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a post-test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, on the first webinar,
we went through 20 questions to test your
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge to see where you were starting
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a SurveyMonkey survey,
and if you look in the bottom left-hand
[SPEAKER_01]: box, the webslinks box, you'll see the
post-test there, and you're able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be open for a month in case you
haven't had a chance to finish all the
[SPEAKER_01]: webinars or you need to go back and listen
to the recording of that one you missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also an evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're asking that each person who
participated, whether you only saw one
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar or whether you went through all
12, would do both the post-test and the
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be sending out an email reminder
on that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're hoping to have, well,
we will have, is materials available for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to assist you with grower training.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some webpages that are under
development that are nearing completion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to have those available as
well and to provide input as to their
[SPEAKER_01]: utility and what may be missing or what
would be useful that may not be offered
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The members of the team will be available
to assist on request, and I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: posting training dates on the webinar
archive page so that we can try to avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: overlaps in training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm convinced, of course,
that everyone will want to go out and do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll have in terms of grower
training materials is a one-hour
[SPEAKER_01]: PowerPoint presentation that's going to
discuss Cornell Soil Health Test and the
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment, and then foliar analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be used in a classroom or field
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a set of grower pre and
post-test questions to go with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a short set, five or 10 questions,
so that we can measure knowledge before
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowledge after.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some sample test results for
group exercises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when Marvin and Eric talked about
the test results and what sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: mediation would be needed, and also Robert
with the soil health test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then apart from that, in terms of your
grower training, you're able to add
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever bits and pieces you might like
from playing the recorded webinars,
[SPEAKER_01]: having guest speakers, covering other
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you can cater it to the needs of
your growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once your training is complete,
we're going to ask you to select some
[SPEAKER_01]: participating growers to participate in
the soil health test and the foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to have a standard
operating procedure that we'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: available to you and them, which will
discuss how they might implement at least
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two of the practices on their farm
on a portion of their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would also ask them to
participate in an exit interview to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their insights on the crop health and
performance of the new practices that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've implemented versus their standard
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll be hearing from me in the
next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope many of you will be interested in
participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to thank you very much for
being a part of the webinar series.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a couple of questions,
or at least Lee has a question about
[SPEAKER_03]: funding to support the outreach program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee, we didn't have that in the budget for
the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We specifically were interested in
building the numbers of soil health tests
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to go into the database so that we
could start working on those
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we focused the funds in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can put your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can put the email right here in the
chat box if you'd like, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the links are there for the
educator post-test if you're ready to take
[SPEAKER_03]: that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, you could do the webinar series
evaluation probably, because you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: need to listen to all of them in order to
complete that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do hope to hear from all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a rather exciting way to
get training out to a large amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope everyone is able to take
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any other questions,
please.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the outreach program targeted only to
Northeast states, Bob wonders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily only Northeast
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the primary focus of Northeast
SARE.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really are interested in getting 50
growers lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once I have an idea of,
once people have let me know who's
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in having a training,
I'll have a better handle on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be able to talk to you about that
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially, what we decided to do would
be we have 50 complementary sets of tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how many grower trainings
that we have, we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: dividing them amongst the number of
trainings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Sharon, in terms of first come
first serve basis, no, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators who are hosting training,
say we have 10 educators who host
[SPEAKER_01]: training, we have 50 tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would have five tests available
for each training.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have four people, we could have 12
and 1 half for each training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of get the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we have four scheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're listed in the box on the
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping in the next couple of
weeks to get the other scheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll know how many tests we have
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you scroll down in the notes box,
there are some grower training dates.
[SPEAKER_03]: In South Cairo on March 28, Greenwich,
New York on March 29, May 9 in Waterport,
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, and May 10 in Williamson,
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will have more information about
them, exact contact information and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: in case someone would like to go and watch
how it's done or just want to advertise it
[SPEAKER_03]: to your growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do hope that you will go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of you are very experienced
growers or educators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this should not be a problem,
especially when you have all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment to do the training with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other questions either
about content or about the administrative
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of approach of the grant?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if not, I'm going to leave this webinar
classroom open for about 15 extra minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let people go to the webinar series
evaluation and complete that survey
[SPEAKER_03]: monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate all of your time,
the speaker's time, and Kathy,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially Hugh, who is now busy trying to
get the website and all the materials up
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And good luck with your training,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
