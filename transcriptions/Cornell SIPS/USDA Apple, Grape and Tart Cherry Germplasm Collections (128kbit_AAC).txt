[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic of my talk today is USDA apple
grape and tar cherry germplasm collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to give you kind of
overview of what we do at Geneva so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any specific question about any of my
talk or you have any question about the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection please contact me later.
[SPEAKER_00]: First very briefly about some of the
history for the national plant germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: President Lincoln as established the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau of Agriculture, current day USDA,
and also signed the two months later
[SPEAKER_00]: signed the Morale-Langren College Act in
1862.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1898 the section of seed and
plant introduction was established and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first PI which was cabbage from Russia was
introduced by Niels Henson also at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same year in 1898.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in 1898 the federal plant
introduction garden which is the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a current day subtropical
horticultural station was established in
[SPEAKER_00]: Miami, Florida in July the same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later in 1904 another plant
introduction station was established at
[SPEAKER_00]: Chico, California in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in 1919 two other one one in
Savannah, Georgia and one in Glendale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1941 Maryland was established.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1946 the Research and Marketing Act
allowed to establishment of four
[SPEAKER_00]: additional regional plant introduction
stations that including the Northeastern
[SPEAKER_00]: Project we call that NE9 at Geneva,
New York in July 1948 which has become
[SPEAKER_00]: current day the vegetable crop repository
in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here just show you a diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diagram is a little bit old but
basically give you some idea of the center
[SPEAKER_00]: of orange or center of fruit for a lot of
fruit we consume current day except some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the small fruit is native to North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise majority of the fruit that we
consume actually come from other part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually should be more central
origin in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Central Asia and that's why we
need to conduct exchanges also exploration
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to collect a lot of germplasm from
other part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of the pioneer that involved
with the plant introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two person on the top is David
Fairchild and Walter Swingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the two gentlemen in their 20
actually established section of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction in 1898.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niles Henson is the first plant explorer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He introduced the first PI back into the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and famous Frank Beyer spent a lot of year
in China doing a lot of exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watson Popony he was actually avocado
plant explorer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent a lot of time in the highland of
Mexico and Guatemala and later in Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America and Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting part is he also aspired for
the national security agent during the
[SPEAKER_00]: World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in the 60, Professor Olmo,
viticulture department at UC Davis collect
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of variety from the military region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Dr. Charlie Riggs, Mr. Tomato
spent a lot of time and Andy is collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: all the wild tomato germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those material actually also have
a copy at Geneva current day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is just a diagram showing some of the
location for a lot of germplasm stations
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we basically have a lot of
different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we used to have a location
in Palmer, Alaska and that station due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the budget issue was closed down three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some history about how the Geneva colonial
repository came about basically in 1974.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an American society horticulture
science workshop on the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: conserving fruit and nut crop was held in
Gulf Ontario, Canada in 1974.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later Brooks and Barton based on that
meeting, they described a plan for a
[SPEAKER_00]: colonial repository that they argued that
really have a different needs than the
[SPEAKER_00]: common seed repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, from that discussion and
planning in 1983, Bill Cermak who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisor for fun operation was hired and
came on board and a year later in 1984,
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil Forsyne who was the first curator was
also came on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the apple, the malice and also the
coral hotty grape, the vitus, propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: actually started in 1983 and the first
planting was in 1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tar cherry collection was originally
actually housed at the Davis repository in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but it was moved to Geneva in
1995 for better growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the USDA, our research unit actually
divided into different units.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two units at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is the planned genetic resource
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under that, we have three different
project plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the seed crop or the
vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is the corn crop, apple,
cold hardy grape and tar cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is actually apple rooster
breeding program leading by generifacio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other research unit is the grape
genetic research unit, the GGRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working on great genetics and also
genomic upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here just showing some of the picture of
the colonial collection throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a view from 1985 where basically
it's about two mile from the Geneva
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the McCarthy Fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are occupied McCarthy South and this is
about 50 acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that picture taken in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here start some nursery operation over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 year later, this you can see at the
same location, but just from opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, the picture was taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically have a lot of grape and tar
cherry all the way in the back and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slide below just showing a lot of
different picture, diversity of material
[SPEAKER_00]: for the malice we have in our collection
and also some of the vitus and tar cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have a gorgeous color during the
fall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mission of the colonial repository
basically throughout the entire system,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a four basic mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a similar mission for all the
repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly is trying to acquire, second is
trying to preserve and the third is trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to characterize and the fourth is trying
to distribute all the germplasm we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each repository is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our acquisition, we're basically
trying to get materials through exchanges
[SPEAKER_00]: and also exploration based on the
worldwide basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our preservation purpose, we have a
field collection of trees and also we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a cold storage of seeds, most of wild
germplasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we use acquired preservation of
dormant budwood at the USDA National
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Genetic Resources Preservation
Unit, four column Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here on, we'll call them the four
column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for characterization, we use
morphological method or genetic method
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to study all the accession we have
and all the information from our study
[SPEAKER_00]: basically are stored at the germplasm
resources information network database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that GRIN.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new version of the GRIN should become on
board this year sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called GRIN Global, supposed to have
a better function, but it's quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: learning curve trying to change into the
new system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our distribution purpose, that's the
major difference between the colonial
[SPEAKER_00]: repository versus the seed repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, our main distribution material
are the dormant budwood, but we'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute some of the budwood,
but for research purpose, we also
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute pollen, flower, fruit,
seed, leaf, and also a lot of DNA sample
[SPEAKER_00]: in recent year, basically free to all the
stakeholder and researcher, both in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and also worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another very important function of
the distribution is trying to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: public awareness of the value of the
genetic resources we preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, the establishment of the
collection, because the location is at
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, so for the Malus collection,
basically we just knock on the door of Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Wei.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the apple sign breeder at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all the donations from all the
Geneva apple breeding program,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically been going on for over 100 years
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of material from Dr. Roger Wei
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also get a lot of material from
other breeding program in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, such as the PRA program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stands for the apple breeding program
among the three campus, Purdue University,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutgers, and also University of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get a lot of material from other
campus and also from Agriculture Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get material from England National
Collection at the Long Ashton Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Station, and also material from several
different other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Vitis collection, basically,
we started by donation also from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Great Breeding Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it was Dr. Bruce Reich who
is still in charge of the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get some additional material from
UC Davis, University of Minnesota,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Dakota, and several other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I only have time to talk more about
the Malus wild germplasm material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a diagram, a kind of map showing
worldwide where the Malus species are
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there are four different
species in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two species in Europe,
the Malus sebaceous, also Malus forontina.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two wild Malus material in
Central Asia, the Malus orientalis and
[SPEAKER_00]: also sebaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, in Asia, basically most in
China, also some in Japan and other
[SPEAKER_00]: places, they just have more than probably
close to 40 to 50 different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in general, that's a consensus
that Malus actually originated from
[SPEAKER_00]: Central and Southwestern China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throughout history, especially
through the Silk Road, material actually
[SPEAKER_00]: able to reach Central Asia eventually went
to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the material came to North America
actually was believed in the ancient time
[SPEAKER_00]: during the Ice Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's an ancient land bridge
between North America and Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the material actually came the other
direction, came to North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: A common modern apple we consume is the
Malus domesticata.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a diploid species with the
cytochromosome 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is strongly believed that the origin of
modern apple actually came from Malus
[SPEAKER_00]: sebaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some parentage involved with
maybe orientalis, maybe some sebaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is still being debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next phase of the Malus collection at
Geneva I consider was expansion phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: the collection, especially through a lot
of exploration activity from the late 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first exploration was Professor Whedon
of Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to the West Coast of North America
to collect a lot of Malus sofusca in 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, the graduate student, Elizabeth
Dickinson, for her thesis work,
[SPEAKER_00]: she collected a lot of material in Eastern
US, also in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different species, Angusifolia,
Coronaria, and Oioensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 1989 on, Professor Herb Alwinco,
once again together with Elizabeth
[SPEAKER_00]: Dickinson, and also with curator Phil
Forsline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to Central Asia, four different
countries, to collect Malus cevicheae four
[SPEAKER_00]: different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 1997, Professor Alwinco together
with Phil Forsline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to collect seven different Malus
species in China, in southwest China,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sichuan province.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, in 2001, Gabel from Germany,
went to the same place to collect similar
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were extensive exchange material
between the two explorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, Phil Forsline together with
Professor Amy Arizoni from Michigan State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to Russia to collect a lot of
material, including Malus orontalis,
[SPEAKER_00]: also some other materials such as tar
cherry and some other cherry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1999, Professor Alwinco together with
Phil Forsline, they went to Turkey to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect Malus orontalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, in 2001 and later, Joseph Postman
from Kovalis Repository went to Armenia
[SPEAKER_00]: and Georgia to collect a lot of different
species, including Malus orontalis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Malus cevicheae exploration in Central
Asia has a very long history.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Russian scientists, they studied
the wild Malus gemplasm material in that
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: As early as I can find out was 1796,
all the way into the 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The famous plant geneticist, Nicholas
Ivanhoe Vavilov of Russia, he first
[SPEAKER_00]: explored the wild apple forest in Central
Asia, basically in 1929.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1929, Westover, who was a plant
explorer, was sent by USDA to Almaty,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translation means the father of the apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in 1929, met up with Vavilov and
explored the material over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1990s, Professor Denglov of
Kazakhstan Academy of Science with his
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, they explored all the wild
Malus gemplasm material in Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the 1950s all the way into early
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an extensive review that was
written in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture from 1929.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Westover, who came from USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Vavilov, and they met up in
Almaty, basically in Kazakhstan,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking around the Malus cevicheae
material in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically 60 years later,
another group of USDA scientists from
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva went there to collect the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something interesting I dig up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vavilov actually came to Ithaca in 1932
for the Sixth International Congress of
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the vice president for the society
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is basically who is who in genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both animal and plant geneticists were all
in that meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including Barbara McInta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in that trip, he also went to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually presented two paintings of
wild apple from Kazakhstan and Kazakhstan
[SPEAKER_00]: to Professor Wilenton of Experimental
Station also in 1932.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two paintings actually still being
preserved at the Lee Library in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wonder, anybody recognize the
building on campus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's still there, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, I want to make a pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need to collect and also
preserve wild germplasm material from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of wild germplasm,
also native habitat, are lost due to
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural development, also changes in
agriculture practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of urban development issue,
a lot of animal grazing, environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation is a serious issue,
such as soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduction in water supply and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the climate changes,
such a greenhouse effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: desertification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of wild germplasm material also
is being threatened due to new pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of time, also invasive species
into the native habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of time, plant biodiversity
also being reduced because of agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also agricultural commoditization.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for the worldwide avocado
trade, basically 95% of all the trade just
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on single variety that has avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar for when you go to most of the
supermarket outside of New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably only find about 11 apple
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will commonly see that in the
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chen from the Chinese Academy of Science,
ladies and gentlemen, did a survey in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically compared the native range
of Malus cerevisiae in Xinjiang,
[SPEAKER_00]: China, compared with the survey was done
all the way back in 1959.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they found out in comparison
between the two, in the time frame of 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years, 80% of the native habitat of Malus
cerevisiae was lost due to agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: development, animal grazing, a lot of
over-harvesting of the wild fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of top work of the native
species into modern variety and also a new
[SPEAKER_00]: apple insect problem in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture showing this insect able
to attack the Malus cerevisiae in the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this is a picture from the apple
exploration all the way to the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right, to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they did their exploration in
Kazakhstan, they actually see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sheep grazing in the wild apple forest
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture in the middle is not apple,
but argan trees from Morocco, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the sheep really like the argan tree
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to make a point here,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a map showing the plant exploration
of Malus cerevisiae in Central Asia by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Genetic Research Unit in the late
80s into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically there are 12 major sites,
most of them actually in Kazakhstan,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also a site in Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, also Tajikistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is actually China.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually Xinjiang area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survey was about native habitat was
actually right here in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a summary about tremendous amount
of work on the exploration for Malus
[SPEAKER_00]: cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically there were four trips together,
12 major sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the phenotype they observed
in the field, they actually select 44,
[SPEAKER_00]: they call Malus cerevisiae elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the budwood and they bring back
to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also collect over 894 c accession of
Malus cerevisiae from the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That including basically over 120,000 c's
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 30,000 of those c's was actually
distributed to all the researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 39,000 of the c's actually still
being stored at the four column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 50,000 of those c's actually
stored at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last couple years, we also have
collected over 50,000 open pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from Malus cerevisiae seeding block
at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the Bontania desire seed for
routine distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you probably read the book by
Marco Pollen, Bontania desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got actually very routine request
from the reader because in the book
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that Phil Forsline is willing to
give out the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're constantly actually get inquiry
about Malus cerevisiae seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't give out seed from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original seed from the wild collection
will actually give out the OPC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the routine distribution to the
stakeholder.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last few year, we actually see a
increase, a lot of inquiry actually from
[SPEAKER_00]: European country.
[SPEAKER_00]: England, Germany, France, most recent was
actually from Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you'll show you some of the picture
from the exploration back in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically, throughout the several
explorations, sometimes they went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the same location at different year to
collect the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Dengelow is the major cooperator
for all the exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually came to Geneva in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the team went back in 93,
95, and 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Elizabeth Dickinson.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, she already graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she came back to join the exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they also find very nice
phenotype in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will collect the budwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call that Malus cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lead, bring back to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places they went to actually is
really remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the only way they can get to is
actually through helicopter ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the picture from the 1997
exploration in Sichuan, China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the exploration, Professor Li,
who was from the Southwest Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: University, he was the leading authority
on wild Malus material in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to visit in Geneva in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the team from Geneva went there in
1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Alwin Koh over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every exploration is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing stand out in that particular
exploration was there was agreement that
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans were not allowed to collect the
fruit in the wild directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the Chinese scientists allowed to
collect the fruit from the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Americans were able to participate in
processing the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location they collected the fruit was
actually next border to Tibet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very high altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see Professor Alwin Koh trying
to walk up the hill to look at the yachts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the elevation of about 4,000
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over 12,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the picture from the 1999
exploration in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have to do all kind of
things when you're on the exploration
[SPEAKER_00]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, basically, the route they took in
Turkey, they start with the city in Izmir
[SPEAKER_00]: near GNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, they went up north, cover
several locations, and then they double
[SPEAKER_00]: back once again to the north, coming back
to Azir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned, sometimes we collect the bow
from the wild and bring that material back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, for importation, all the
material from foreign countries need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the USDA Avis quarantine process
before the material can come to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, we basically receive between
10 to 20 accessions from Avis every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent years, some of the material we
got from Avis, that included malice,
[SPEAKER_00]: aversia, elite from the exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of the cider apple from
northern Spain that was introduced by
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Ian Merwin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of different variety from
different country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see basically from all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the accessions, when they go
through the Avis quarantine process,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take about a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some extreme cases,
especially this case, one of the malice,
[SPEAKER_00]: aversia, elite from Kazakhstan was
collected in 1996 exploration trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only released by Avis to us last year
after 16 years in the quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a provisional release.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the way for additional two to
three years before its permanent release
[SPEAKER_00]: to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's all said and done, probably will
take between 18 to 19 years before this
[SPEAKER_00]: material can be released to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes babies just have some disease
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to clean up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through thermotherapy and the
re-indexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just takes some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some material is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to switch gears, talking about
the preservation of the colonial
[SPEAKER_00]: collection at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the variety and the species
we have, we preserve them as a live tree
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, for the malice and punus,
each of the accessions, we have one mature
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with two trees, but in general,
after several years, we only keep one
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the vitus, each of the accessions has
two mature vines in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the wild malice and the vitus germplas
and all the wild seed collection from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild, we store them at minus 20 cold
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one cold room in Geneva,
also one in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of dormant budwood for the malice,
also the punus, they are under long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: backup storage using choir preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we store them in liquid
nitrogen at Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a block of material in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the malice core collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes 250 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes the majority of the common
malice, current-day apple variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also other materials from 42 other
species and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the species hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a rubio here, get some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the collection we have in Geneva,
we have over 80,000 accessions in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the malice collection, we have over
6,600 accessions, including over 5,000
[SPEAKER_00]: field accessions, also over 1,500 seed
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the field, we have several different
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the B9 block, that's the malice
core collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two other larger blocks,
the M7 and the E7 block.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the material we consider a part
of our permanent collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a K1 block, that's the
Kazakhstan malice cevichea seeding block.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on their own roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different from the material in the
three other blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually on dwarfing rootstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for all the wild material,
they are actually on their own root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have another block, we call that
the W3 block, actually several different
[SPEAKER_00]: wild malice materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from Armenia, China,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have one block of material that
includes five different F1 populations
[SPEAKER_00]: from a cross between Gala apple variety,
crossed with five different malice
[SPEAKER_00]: cevicheae.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these five malice cevicheae are
actually being shown to have a different
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider this more like a
pre-breeding population or can use for
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping population for different purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all our permanent collection in the
field, every single tree in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: every single vine in the field,
we have a tag associated with each trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it will tell you which row and
trees and what's the PI number,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the species number, also the
variety code.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the seeding block material,
we usually have a tag for every 10 trees
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to show you some of the picture from
the malice cevicheae wild collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from 2004, both the W3
block and also the K1 block over here in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a similar view in 2007,
three years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a malice cevicheae, different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is all the malice cevicheae from
Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a little bit wild virus,
different wild species on the corner
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the view from the Kazakhstan K1
block in 2012 last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are on their own roots,
they are not on dwarfing root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material basically are now over 20
feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of Phil Forsline,
the first curator to get a professor Herb
[SPEAKER_00]: Awanko looking at malice cevicheae
material in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent a lot of time on those
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the pictures showing some of
the interesting stuff we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have some of the large
fooded malice orientalis from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hybrid, we're not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material, they are very large food,
so they have some ornamental potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some material called malice
transitoria, they're also from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very dwarf material, also very
spreading, very different from most other
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the malice hybrid material
called butterball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful ornamental material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes terrible though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a small malice nursery we use
for our propagation purpose in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this show is a very standard
malice material in our permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planned over 150 new accession last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a small stuba for root stock
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very interesting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very thorny juvenile material from
the wild malice hupiensis from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the thorny material,
usually you will never see that in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things can puncture through the tire
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Vitis collection we have,
basically most of the material we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are wild species, also a lot of
species hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means between Vitis venivora cross
with different wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they have a cold tolerance,
able to stand the weather in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the Vitis venivora material,
that's the common wine grape, table grape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also some raisin grape, those are all
housed at the Davis repository because the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather is better over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 1300 accession in the field
and about over 80 seed accession in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just another few of our basically
main Vitis collection in the field with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the malice collection in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's also another material we have in
our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Vitis hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seedless material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the best taste raising material we
have in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually by end of the season it just
disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another interesting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild species actually from China,
Vitis pzachii.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material is actually very unique leaf
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very deep wedge material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only in two species among over 60
species actually have this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our tar cherry collection is actually a
relatively small collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, tar cherry is a deep-roy
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's a hybrid material from
sweet cherry cross with some of the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: tetra-roy material.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the Funus futicosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 130 accession in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tar cherry is actually a very small
industry, only $40 million in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared with the grape industry is over
$3 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple industry is over $2 billion,
$3 billion and $2 billion in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of tar cherry actually origin from
Central and Eastern Europe and also from
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Majority of the tar cherry accession we
have actually came from the Michigan State
[SPEAKER_00]: tar cherry breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in charge by Dr. Amy Azzoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of characterization for
the Kona collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the accession PI number,
all the species number, species name,
[SPEAKER_00]: the varietal name, the general description
of the material, the source history,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pedigree, if there's available,
also a lot of digital imaging actually all
[SPEAKER_00]: stored at the GRIM database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also carry out a lot of phenotypic,
also genetic characterization,
[SPEAKER_00]: also some other work such as the chemical
composition, the proID, measurement,
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistant, growth habit,
morphological trait and the phenology
[SPEAKER_00]: trait, some of the description about the
production, also microcellular markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the information we have all stored
at the GRIM database.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, hopefully, we'll have more
GBS information, the genotype by
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing, marker data, also more food
quality data, also the sequencing data in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information basically is
searchable at the GRIM database.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a lot more about the
wild mouse material, a lot of evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: we have done in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendous amount of disease evaluation
work has been done in the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated against different fire blight,
scab, the blue mow, post-harvest decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of work on mapping of
resistant genes from the wild mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of work on drought resistant
evaluation, also cold hardiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: also a lot of genetic diversity study,
population study, also using the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: marker trying to determine the core
collection, also using genetic marker
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to identify inter-space hybrid,
also duplicate in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a lot of, I mentioned before,
some of the mapping population that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for mapping different kind of
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I want to give you one specific
example about disease resistant evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: against blue mow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work between the Appalachian Food
Research Station of USDA at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Currysville, West Virginia, together with
the researcher in Volcanic Center and the
[SPEAKER_00]: PGRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular accession actually is
being shown to be resistant against the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mow, and they came from Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011 and 2012, we collect fruit from
101 individuals from this F1 mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we inoculate the fruit with
penicillin expansum, and then we measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the lesion size, sometimes five to seven
days after the inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge environmental difference
between 2001 and 2012, but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: disease rating across the year actually
highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The QDL mapping for the blue mow resistant
actually being mapped resistant to linkage
[SPEAKER_00]: group number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here just showing a picture, we're
collecting the fruit last year in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field for the inoculation experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to show you example of 11 fruit from
two, one susceptible and one resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny, you can see basically after five
to seven days after inoculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's significant difference in the
lesion size between the susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: material versus the resistant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use different genetic marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular example, we use nine
microcellular marker to study over 1900
[SPEAKER_00]: mow accession we have in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to identify 238 malus
domesticata and also 10 other malus
[SPEAKER_00]: accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually share the same genotype
based on nine SSL marker with at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: other malus domesticata accession in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we find anything with a similar
genetic profile, we're also trying to look
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fruit image, trying to confirm
the genetic study result.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're able to identify total
of 23 spores per family, that including
[SPEAKER_00]: 104 accession in the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there are some mistake, we identify
also some duplicate, we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify from this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also carry out a lot of horticulture
and food quality trade evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early year, our unit actually
devote a lot of effort into choir
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation method development for the
malus and the prunus and also together
[SPEAKER_00]: with four column they did a lot of study
on long-term survival rate of the choir
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation bud material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the last couple years,
we focus a lot on digital image of
[SPEAKER_00]: different fruit, the leaf and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We upload a lot of image into the GRINT
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also involved with polyphenolic and
also antioxidant capacity study of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vitus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we're working on the malus and the
tertiary right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also juice quality and some specific
example like the red flash apple and also
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit obsession rate of some of the malus
accession we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here just show different digital image we
have for different material in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we still have some shadow,
we're trying to improve the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photo in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here just another example of genetic study
of a red flash apple in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study including over 100 accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they have different kind of red
flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see for the different pattern of
red flash, they have some of the red flash
[SPEAKER_00]: actually localized in the calyx area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them actually associate with the
vascular bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them just throughout entire cortex
but not including the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them just focus on the core region
and some of the material actually
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout entire fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different color,
different pattern, also different
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity among different accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also look at trying to use PCR,
trying to identify the MIB10 which is
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription promoter that previously has
been mapped to linkage group number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's strongly associated with the red
flash fruit among all the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this particular promoter is neither
sufficient nor required for all the red
[SPEAKER_00]: flash in all the genotype expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also nearly all the red flash material
we're able to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually all could be traced back,
probably a single variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nizowaski Anna actually is a wild,
potentially probably a wild material of a
[SPEAKER_00]: malus avicii from Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the red flash available right now
is actually all could probably trace back
[SPEAKER_00]: to this single variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we also upload a lot of proidi
information based on flow cytometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some of the information based on
history information available from the
[SPEAKER_00]: GRIN.
[SPEAKER_00]: We upload 682 malus domesticata and malus
hybrid proidi information into the GRIN.
[SPEAKER_00]: That including 554 diploid material,
17 chimeric, 91 triploid and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have flow cytometry information
for over 664 wild malus accession from 53
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proidi is a little bit more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them they have diploid,
triploid, tetraploid all the way into
[SPEAKER_00]: pentaploid within the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we basically we have micro satellite
marker data for basically all the
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent accession we have in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in principle we should be able to infer
the proidi level from the SSR marker in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since last year we also initiated the
malus genotype by sequencing effort for
[SPEAKER_00]: our malus collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study we're including over 1,950
material from our collection in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's including over 1,400 malus
domesticata.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different wild malus species,
all including in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used two enzymes for restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 21 play in total and we're just in
the beginning stage of the data analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each play we have we're able to obtain
between 100 to 100 medians good rate per
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're doing a lot of
sequencing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of the initial analysis we've done
we're using golden deletion genome as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference genome for comparison in our
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that particular study comparison about
40% of the sequence actually could not be
[SPEAKER_00]: mapped back to the golden deletion genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually 40% of the sequence we identified
upon the GBS study actually never been
[SPEAKER_00]: known before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the future we're trying to make
comparison without any reference genome so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to create any bias against
especially the wild malus material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully in the future we can use the
data trying to study a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domestication issues still there's some
debate over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding history, gene flow,
the evolution, also gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade association I hope something we can
do in the future and also other issues
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the malus genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up to switch gear a little bit
talking about distribution for the corona
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we update our catalog for
apple, grape and tar cherry that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically all the distribution are free of
charge to the stakeholder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your summary table of some of the
number of sample we distribute in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see back in 2007 and 2008 in
combined we distribute over 11,000 sample
[SPEAKER_00]: in those two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last two years we distribute over
9,000 material per year in the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of work, a lot of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a picture showing we're
collecting dormant barwood from the malus
[SPEAKER_00]: avesia ceiling from Kazakhstan for drought
resistant study we're cooperating with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me it was very cold in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier before one of
another purpose for the distribution I see
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually trying to promote the value of
the germplasm material we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore we carry out a lot of outreach,
education event, also a lot of to come
[SPEAKER_00]: into a corner collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically during the springtime,
the summertime, also in the fall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far not too many people come in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year for example the plant breeding
courses they will come to our collection
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when they come to our collection
they probably have the best time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry our food back too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all very happy to come to the
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year also the summer scholar student
at the station also came to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to have Dr. Hale Brabunko
actually talk with students about all his
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also carry out a lot of germplasm
exchanges and also visit with other gene
[SPEAKER_00]: banks throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example this missing Yun Yang He.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the great curator and also
molecular geneticist for the South Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: She spent about three months with us last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's back in South Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future hopefully we're going to
start exchanging material especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild VITAS material between the two gene
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of in the summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the short-term goal we have for
the corner collection in the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all we'd like to continue digital
imaging of the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always take more photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we are trying to finish the
evaluation of VITAS phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have two-year data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that for additional two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we're going to start the malus
phenology evaluation hopefully for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing on the food quality also
in nutritional evaluation for the malus
[SPEAKER_00]: and tar cherry, the work we started since
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to carry out a gap
analysis for the malus also VITAS
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm material using different
geo-referencing data, the climate data,
[SPEAKER_00]: also genomic data when it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we're able to finish the gap analysis
in our collection we intend trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin collection more systematically for
the North American VITAS material which we
[SPEAKER_00]: think we really should focus on for the
next couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also potentially we're probably trying to
collect additional material from the North
[SPEAKER_00]: American malus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four different species in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue trying to apply
the GBS marker for the malus and also tar
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry genome analysis, probably more
trade association analysis, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially allele mining for a lot of
wild malus and also the malus and tar
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry material we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we're cooperating with a lot of
different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing on evaluation of a lot of
wild material of the malus, also the VITAS
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on those evaluations results we're
going to try to select some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: material to be included in our permanent
collection in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the long-term goals we have for
the coronal collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all we hope we can carry out
genetic study among our gene bank together
[SPEAKER_00]: with gene bank in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that will lead to future exchange
of material in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also trying to exchange an exploration
maybe the wild malus and also VITAS
[SPEAKER_00]: material especially in China, potentially
in Turkey and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to complete the long-term
backup storage for all the malus and tar
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry accession and trying to develop a
very good reliable long-term backup
[SPEAKER_00]: storage method for VITAS which we don't
have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also additional genotyping and phenotyping
of all the wild genome plasma material we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to reduce the disease level
in our field collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully trying to look into long-term,
trying to develop a new strategy for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term preservation of the coronal
material we have because we're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: facing a potential limiting space issue,
also resources issue in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally I want to acknowledge all the
people involved with the program for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, especially a group of guys I
work with every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them the 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are four guys that actually work on
the collection day in and day out
[SPEAKER_00]: basically doing all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also other people from the PGRU and also
former curator Phil Forsline, Professor
[SPEAKER_00]: Alwin Koh, Plant Pathology Department,
Larry Robinson, Janelle Fazio of our unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and also folks at the Kearneysville,
Gail Volk, Chris Richard from Fort
[SPEAKER_00]: Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people at Fort Collins involved with
the long-term backup storage and also all
[SPEAKER_00]: the folks at PGRU and GGRU and also the
field research unit of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: at Geneva Station throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also all the folks at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally the funding support from the
National Serial Project and also the NEI
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional Experimental Station funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, has the apple genome be
sequenced?
[SPEAKER_00]: How we, in that case, how I refer to
Golden Delicious, how are we going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a published sequence based on
Golden Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we use for our comparison,
some of the material, the GBS data we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not an expert in the area,
but the discussion is, because throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the domestication history, if you simply
use Golden Delicious genome sequence as
[SPEAKER_00]: your reference genome, we do have a lot of
wild malice material that's probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with domestication of Golden
Delicious, the malice domesticator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use Golden Delicious as the base
for comparison, you're going to be biased
[SPEAKER_00]: against a lot of wild material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to use Golden
Delicious sequence as a comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also we're trying to do other
comparison without any Golden Delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequence, so we're not creating any
bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other issues involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, triploid is a very serious
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyploid is very difficult for GBS
analysis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the methodology, my understanding
is, is developed for diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have a lot of polyploid material,
and also especially the triploid material,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can create a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a problem with philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult because it's open
field collection, so it's never been
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really have resources to
testing material all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's always an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the foreign distribution, all the
material we send out have to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the quarantine process of the receiving
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, at least for the
malice, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, any plan for mutagenesis
analysis of some of the collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some research involved for the
VITAS material by the GGRU folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing some mutation to find
looking for certain mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are looking for that,
some of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not for malice, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main disease problem we have is fire
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially, of course, right now we rely
on chemical control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's always difficult, chemical
control, and also plus the pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, potentially, we can look into
some other strategy, maybe cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it can reduce the disease level
in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always a balance between how much
resources we have, well, how much we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much stretched everything
right now for the work we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always appreciate more help.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
