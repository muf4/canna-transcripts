[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: The title of my talk today is The Malus
Collection in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: National Plant Germplasm System.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here to show you a publication from the
Global Crop Biodiversity Trust two years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see that in North America very
few actually the crop we use and we eat
[SPEAKER_04]: actually came from North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the longest time U .S.
[SPEAKER_04]: diploma actually start collecting
germplasm material from around the globe
[SPEAKER_04]: as early as late 1700s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 1862 President Lincoln created
a U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bureau of Agriculture the current day USDA
and also signed the Morale-Langren
[SPEAKER_04]: University Act which is very important
related to Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then move forward 30 years in 1898 for
major event happened in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: exploration activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: First is the office of a seed and the
plant introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The current plant exchange office was
established by Fairchild and Swingo at
[SPEAKER_04]: that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that year the introduction garden for
the tropical plant was established in
[SPEAKER_04]: Miami Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first repository in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also at that year Neil Hanson was
hired as the first plant explorer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he also introduced the first plant
material PI-00001 Branca Brassica OEAC
[SPEAKER_04]: from Russia at that year also introduced
by Hanson.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant introductions later station
later was established at Chico California
[SPEAKER_04]: in 1904 and also in Savannah Georgia and
Glendale Maryland in 1919.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 1946 based on the research and
marketing at four plant introductions was
[SPEAKER_04]: established including the Northeast region
the A&I project station at Geneva New York
[SPEAKER_04]: in July 1948.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a picture showing some of the
pioneer in the plant exploration activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave Fairchild and Walter Swingo who was
actually both of 26 years old recent
[SPEAKER_04]: graduated from Kansas State University in
major in plant physiology I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Neil Hanson as a first plant
explorer later he actually became a
[SPEAKER_04]: professor at South Dakota State for
longest time for over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most famous plant explorer
Frank Meyer and also Dr. Charlie Rick at
[SPEAKER_04]: UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He spent almost entire career collecting
tomato germ plants in the Andes in South
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Harold Olmo who introduced a lot
of great material in the 1960s from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mediterranean region into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also Wilson Popony spent a lot of time
several decades in Central America
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting a lot of food germ plants and
material including avocado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a photo of an interpreter standing
in front of the large wild mouse material
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Tianshan region of Chinese
Turkestan in 1911.
[SPEAKER_04]: This photo was taken by Frank Meyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some photo of some of the apple and
also crab apple food in the market in Xi
[SPEAKER_04]: 'an China in 1914.
[SPEAKER_04]: This photo also taken by Frank Meyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently there's 20 locations throughout
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: that either a laboratory or repository
dedicated the national plant germ process
[SPEAKER_04]: system including right here in Geneva New
York.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Geneva New York there's actually two
research unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is the Plant Genetic Resources
Unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The PGRU that including the seed crop or
the vegetable germ pleasant collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: My colleague Joanne Le Bay talked about
the collection last October.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also here in the horticultural seminar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have the Kono Crop which is
the apple, cohardy grape, and hard cherry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we have a program on the Apple
Rooster breeding program led by Dr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gennaro Fascio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have another research unit is
the Grape Genetic Research Unit,
[SPEAKER_04]: GGRU.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on a genetics and genome
upgrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing you some of the photo
from 19, oh actually skip one.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Kono Repository it started
actually back in 1974 a discussion at the
[SPEAKER_04]: ASHS American Society Horticultural
Workshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about the need for fruit and nut
crop repository system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then further discussion in late 1970s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Bill Cermak who was a supervisor
fund operation was hired on board in 1983.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill is actually still working on Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 1984 my predecessor Phil
Forsline the first curator for the
[SPEAKER_04]: collection came on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And planting of the grape and also apple
collection actually beginning in 1983.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first planting was in 1986.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tar cherry collection originally was
housed at the Davis Repository in
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was moved to Geneva in 1995 due to
better growing environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just show you some of the photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: The view of the collection in the McCarthy
Farm South.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a nursery just started in 1985.
[SPEAKER_04]: View from 2007 and view from two years ago
during the boom time for all the tar
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry collection over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just show you some of the photo of
some of the diversity of the apple
[SPEAKER_04]: collection we have over there in Geneva,
New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the establishment of the models
collection in the mid 1980 actually
[SPEAKER_04]: started by donation of a lot of apple
material from different program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the most important is the apple
breeding program of Cornell University
[SPEAKER_04]: actually led by Dr. Roger Williams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Roger Way at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a photo showing some of the older
professor at that time in the horticulture
[SPEAKER_04]: department over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is Dr. Roger Way there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also material from the Purdue,
Rutgers, the Indian Oil Apple Breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: Program, the PRI Apple Breeding Program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a lot of material from Washington
State University, Agricultural Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: different Arboretum, Glendale Introduction
Station, Covalence Repository,
[SPEAKER_04]: also the United Kingdom, the British Apple
Collection from the Long Ashton Research
[SPEAKER_04]: Station.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then different material from
Australia, China, Germany, Israel,
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland,
also Russia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a photo of the PRI breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Dr. Julius Jenkin from Purdue
University and he's still very active in
[SPEAKER_04]: American Society Horticultural Science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I'd like to show you the distribution
of all the wild model species worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, majority of the wild
models materials actually located in Asia,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in China.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is well believed that models actually
origin from southwest China.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you move north to central and
northern part of the China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you continue moving on to the
west, follow the cell growth through
[SPEAKER_04]: history, eventually reach central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild species over there, the model Sevesi,
and then eventually reach Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, models Orntellus,
Orntina, and also models Silvestris,
[SPEAKER_04]: the European Crab Apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: In North America, there's actually four
models wild species material on the east
[SPEAKER_04]: coast into Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have models Coronaria, models Iowensis
in the Midwest, and also models
[SPEAKER_04]: Angusphodia, the Southern Crab Apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the Pacific Northwest,
we have models Fusca.
[SPEAKER_04]: The modern-day apple, models domesticata,
is actually a hybrid species.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has most of the material deployed with
the 17-satel chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with their origin actually came from
models Sevesi in the central Asia,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we will talk a little bit more,
and also from the European Crab Apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas, why are three of those species
shown in purple?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are actually the Chinese species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we don't really have them in the
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, we hope in the future we can
get more material from China, also from
[SPEAKER_04]: other area over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is the study we published three years
ago, looking at the conserved sequence of
[SPEAKER_04]: chloroplast genome of 31 different model
species, and using 460 assays.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, a lot of Asian species,
they all group together, especially those
[SPEAKER_04]: material from China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, as you also notice, the models
Fusca from the Pacific Northwest is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually also closely related to a lot of
Asian species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, it is well believed that models
Fusca actually came from Asia through the
[SPEAKER_04]: land bridge when the land was still
frozen, and they reached Alaska,
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually come to British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon, and Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the modern-day apple,
models Domesticata, and also its
[SPEAKER_04]: progenitor species, they are also actually
closely related to the Asian species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have, there's a group of Asian
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are actually more tropical.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the models Gunnanensis is
actually the best example.
[SPEAKER_04]: The morphology and everything of all this
material is really different from most of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Asian wild models material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So phylogenetically, they kind of group
together by themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have one very unique material,
models Tomari.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually located in place like in
Vietnam, Myanmar, and also into Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_04]: The history of this material is still
being debated, but it's possible this
[SPEAKER_04]: material might be actually closer related
to pirates instead of models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some researcher are working on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have some models material in
the Mediterranean region, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: a forintina in Northern Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe there are some other wild
model species in Europe, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Highland of Lebanon, and also
there's wild species in Sicily.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are really isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of maybe have a unique
evolution, also domestication history
[SPEAKER_04]: among those isolated species material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, of course, we have the North
American three wild species in the East
[SPEAKER_04]: Coast of the North American continent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing a chronogram,
a time frame, differentiation between the
[SPEAKER_04]: different wild model species.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this particular study, they actually
use two North American wild species,
[SPEAKER_04]: the models Allowensis and also models
Angus folia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see this two material actually is
most ancient compared with all the wild
[SPEAKER_04]: model species out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are located in North America,
and they separate from all the rest of the
[SPEAKER_04]: models material between by about 20 to 40
million years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how these three species came about in
the North America still is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: major puzzle, at least in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon after the establishment of the models
collection, based on the donation from all
[SPEAKER_04]: the program, basically from all over the
US and also from around the globe,
[SPEAKER_04]: the researcher actually realized there's
really the need trying to collect more
[SPEAKER_04]: wild models material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore, in 1987, Professor Whedon,
who is also working in Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_04]: he started exploration for models Fusca in
Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And followed by Dr. Elizabeth Dickinson,
who was the first PhD student of Dr. Jeff
[SPEAKER_04]: Doyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for her PhD, at Cornell University,
she collected a lot of material,
[SPEAKER_04]: Angus folia, coronaria, also Allowensis,
and studied their genetic relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then starting in 1989, 1993,
95 and 96, Professor Herb Alwinko,
[SPEAKER_04]: who was a professor at Plum Plasology
Department at Cornell University in
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva, together with my predecessor,
Phil Forsline, and also a researcher from
[SPEAKER_04]: different institution, even from different
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went over to Central Asia,
especially in Kazakhstan, to collect the
[SPEAKER_04]: model survey material, four different
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 1997, they carry out one of
the exploration in China, collect seven
[SPEAKER_04]: different wild model species material,
and followed by one exploration in Russia
[SPEAKER_04]: for models orientalus, and the more in
Turkey for models orientalus too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after almost 16 year hiatus in
the exploration activity, I restarted
[SPEAKER_04]: exploration activity in 2015 by collecting
models Angus folia in the Southern U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: We continue doing so since.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a survey done by, once again,
by Crop Diversity Trust, and also our
[SPEAKER_04]: colleague Gail Volk at the USDA Laboratory
in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a survey for all the apple
collection around the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here she'll show you the top 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple collection in turn of their number,
and also their wild model species
[SPEAKER_04]: representation in the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see at that time, the PGRU
collection is the largest in turn of the
[SPEAKER_04]: total number, and also in turn of the
diversity of the wild model species
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a slide, a borrow from Dr. Peter
Bradding, who is a national program leader
[SPEAKER_04]: for plant germplasm, also genome within
the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave the priority for all the germplasm
resources management, all the repository.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, basically for all the
repository, our number one priority is the
[SPEAKER_04]: maintenance, also the safeguarding of the
material we have in the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the seed crop and the row crop,
that involve a lot of regeneration work,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also safekeeping of the documentation,
also data associated with the session in
[SPEAKER_04]: the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those three activity considered number
one, internal priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next is actually acquisition,
either through exploration or exchange of
[SPEAKER_04]: material from other country, all within
the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third priority is the distribution
of the material to all the stakeholder,
[SPEAKER_04]: including general public and also
researcher, which I will talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next priority is actually
characterization, also evaluation of all
[SPEAKER_04]: the accession in the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next is actually enhancement.
[SPEAKER_04]: What that mean is trying to make crosses,
events to generation, so you can have new
[SPEAKER_04]: trade or disease resistant into events
material that can be used by breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, is trying to carry out
research and support all the preceding
[SPEAKER_04]: priorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: More specifically for the models
collection, our number one priority,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, the maintenance and the
safeguarding of the material.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do that by have a field collection of
all the trees, different material,
[SPEAKER_04]: all different variety, and also wild
species material.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also use cold freezer, minus 20 freezer
to store the seeds we collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we have using cryopreservation of
dormant budwood of the malice at the USDA
[SPEAKER_04]: National Center for Genetic Resources
Preservation Unit at Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next is acquisition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a lot of those activities
through exchanges, also exploration of
[SPEAKER_04]: malice, germplasm in the US, and also from
around the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next is distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: For malice, we usually distribute between
4,000 to 6,000 samples each year,
[SPEAKER_04]: that including winter dormant budwood,
summer budwood, pollen, flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit, seed, leaf, and DNA sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next is the care guide of our
organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: We carry out a lot of different morphology
study, also genetic study, of all the
[SPEAKER_04]: accession in the collection and all the
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are stored at Germplasm Resources
Information Network database, the current
[SPEAKER_04]: day Green Global database.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, we carry out a lot of outreach
actively, trying to increase the public
[SPEAKER_04]: awareness of the value, also importance of
the malice collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here to show you some of the history for
the malice exploration, started by in
[SPEAKER_04]: Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of Russian scientists actually
started and studied the wild malice in
[SPEAKER_04]: Central Asia as early as recorded back in
1796, all the way in early 1900.
[SPEAKER_04]: The famous plant geneticist, Nikolay
Vavilov, actually he first time explored
[SPEAKER_04]: the wild apple forest in Central Asia in
Kazakhstan, first time in 1929,
[SPEAKER_04]: together with one of the plants for
Westover from USDA at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later on, Professor Dengeloff and
other scientists from the Kazakhstan
[SPEAKER_04]: Academy of Science, they explored the wild
malice in the region and also studied them
[SPEAKER_04]: for several decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's just a photo showing the first
exploration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vavilov went to Central Asia, the apple
forest, the first time in 1929.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here is actually Westover,
who's a planned explorer from USDA,
[SPEAKER_04]: accompanied him at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some photos showing Vavilov
actually came to Ithaca, New York in 1932,
[SPEAKER_04]: to attend the Sixth International Congress
of Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here is actually photo of Babur
Makunta, right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time he came to New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also brought with him two paintings of
wild apple from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two paintings actually still house
at the Cornell Library.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this two painting was actually
presented to Professor Wellington,
[SPEAKER_04]: who was a director for the experimental
station at Geneva at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to show you, pay attention to this
particular painting of this apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll follow up on that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a map showing all the exploration
in Central Asia by my predecessor and
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Irv Alwanko and other folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, most of the exploration
actually is in the country of Kazakhstan,
[SPEAKER_04]: about three different time locations,
actually in three other former Soviet
[SPEAKER_04]: republics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So altogether, there are four different
trips in 89, 93, 95, and 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have 12 different major sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also they collect something they call
44 elite, Malo Sevesi elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're in the field, they look
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they show resistance to diseases or
drought or some other unique food quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, they also collect the budwood
of those 44 material, bring it back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: through the quarantine system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But majority of the material they
collected actually the open pollinated
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Altogether, they collect 894 seeds a
session from Malo Sevesi in that four
[SPEAKER_04]: different trips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after, altogether, they collect over
130,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: After return to the U.S., over 40,000 of
those seeds actually was sent out to all
[SPEAKER_04]: the apple researcher in the U.S.,
also around the globe at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up till now, over 39,000 of those seeds
from the original exploration still stored
[SPEAKER_04]: in the freezer at full column.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over 50,000 of those seeds actually
store at the freezer in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the last 10 years, we've been
collecting open pollinated seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: over 200,000 of those OPCs from Malo
Sevesi seeding block.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call those a bounties of desire seed
because, thanks to Michael Pollan's book,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of people asking for the material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people send us a request,
we'll send a package of 25 open pollinated
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds of Malo Sevesi with the instruction
how to stratify and germinate the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have your own wild Malo seed
from Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here to show you quickly some of the
photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as mentioned earlier about that
particular painting on their exploration
[SPEAKER_04]: in 1980 and 90, one particular apple
really similar to the drawing by,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way by presented by Vavilov,
all to Professor Wollenton at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the photo exploration in China in
1997, exploration in Turkey, the route
[SPEAKER_04]: they take over Turkey at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 2015, I restarted exploration
activity at Geneva, New York with some
[SPEAKER_04]: funding once again funded by the airplane
exchange office, National Germ Plaza and
[SPEAKER_04]: Resource Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a 16 day trip, almost 5,000 mile
driving from New York down to Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama and
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to collect over 7,000 open
pollinated seeds from 38 different trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also some of the leaf sample at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Mark Alfre, who is a professor at
University of Southern Mississippi who was
[SPEAKER_04]: actually also a graduate from Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was very helpful for this trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then follow up exploration once again
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost 5,000 open pollinated seeds from 18
different trees and also a lot of more
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble material at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year together with the Julian
group, we actually went to Pennsylvania to
[SPEAKER_04]: collect the Malo's coronary material.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're able to collect over 12,000 open
pollinated seeds from 29 different trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also 11 different location.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually we find there's a lot more Malo's
coronary trees in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot more sample could be collected
maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: A week later, I went on to another trip by
myself to collect Malo's coronary and also
[SPEAKER_04]: Malo's islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in Michigan, Illinois,
Iowa, and also Missouri.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the purposes of this trip actually
was following the footsteps of Elizabeth
[SPEAKER_04]: Dickinson 30 years beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I visited 22 locations that Elizabeth
actually collected back in the late 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, 20 out of 22 sites that he
collected, sometimes her description was
[SPEAKER_04]: saying there's over 100 trees in
particular location.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those 20 sites, all the wild Malo's
trees are all gone due to a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: development in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the lessons I have learned from
the Malo's exploration so far in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing is trying to understand
the role of the target species play in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ecological setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually very important to understand
its location, the age of the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also affecting the growth habit of
the tree, its morphology, and also how
[SPEAKER_04]: reliable is the herbarium sample that we
based on for collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of older herbarium sample by knowing
the possible location and environment this
[SPEAKER_04]: species could be, then actually you can
eliminate some of those location,
[SPEAKER_04]: most likely the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: These sample will not be there anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a lot of site they were
lost, especially during the last 30 years
[SPEAKER_04]: due to urban development, especially seems
like that's the case in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in the South, actually due to a
clear cutting logging practice,
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes they will come in, chop off
entire block of trees, including some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the freestanding wild Malo's material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also since climate change, could be a
problem, a hurricane in the South,
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes flooding, actually also down
there, some of the tree, they've been
[SPEAKER_04]: around for maybe 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that in 2015, but on 2016,
when I returned to the same site,
[SPEAKER_04]: almost trees along a mile track,
actually on both sides, all flooded,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the tree just got killed in that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of land management
decision, especially a lot of wild Malo
[SPEAKER_04]: species material they are very thorny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a lot of the park location,
people actually would cut a tree off
[SPEAKER_04]: because the tree probably are too thorny
because of that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe there's still a lot of wild
Malo's materials still exists,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in public forest, state park,
nature reserve, and even some of them
[SPEAKER_04]: actually on private land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but they're getting more difficult to
find, but I think we should try to spend
[SPEAKER_04]: effort trying to get more before they are
complete disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then talk about why we're trying to
preserve the wild germplasm material,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially the wild Malo's material on a
global scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of material, also their natural
habitat are lost in the last decade or so,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also last half century due to a lot of
agricultural development changes and also
[SPEAKER_04]: the changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a lot of urban development,
also a lot of human activity, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: in some less developed country,
such as a firewood gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a problem that people just
chop off all the wild Malo's in that case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a lot of animal grazing, environment
degradation, climate change could be an
[SPEAKER_04]: issue, also land management decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in some location, especially like
in Europe, that's the case for European
[SPEAKER_04]: Crab Apple Malo Sylvester.
[SPEAKER_04]: The gene flow and also pollen
contamination from the cultivator species
[SPEAKER_04]: really become a serious issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some case, the study showed that 60% of
the wild, the open pollen you collect from
[SPEAKER_04]: 60% of population actually all
contaminated by Malo's domesticated
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a serious issue in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes due to new pests and disease and
also new invasive species, so a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also climate change has been documented in
Central Asia, in Kazakhstan, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last almost 100 year, temperature
has risen, both in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_04]: also during the spring time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some study from China,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 50 year period, 80% of the wild
Malo's material in Xinjiang, China were
[SPEAKER_04]: all lost due to a variety of the reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major reasons surprisingly over
there is actually over-harvest of wild
Malo's.
[SPEAKER_04]: The local resident actually they like to
collecting the material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the last two year, the researcher
actually trying to collect more material,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they couldn't because before they
showed up, all the fruit were gone,
[SPEAKER_04]: collect by local resident over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also there's a study in 2014, showing that
firewood getting is especially serious
[SPEAKER_04]: issue in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of wild Malo's material,
also a lot of food tree material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply just being lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be complete gone in the next 50
to 150 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some target of future Malo's
exploration.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to collect more corn area in
Ohio this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: My colleague, Gail Volk, she's trying to
carry out exploration for Malo's tomorrow
[SPEAKER_04]: in northeast of Inan this fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, maybe more Angus folia in the
southern U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and also Malo's corn area in West Virginia
in two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a lot of material in
different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our wish list that we're trying to
collect hopefully in the next five to 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides go collect the plant germplasm
material either in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: or also around the globe, we also do a lot
of importation of the Malo's germplasm
[SPEAKER_04]: material from other country into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this material we bought in has to go
to USDA APHIS quarantine system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be cleaned up over there,
then will release to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year we receive between 10 to 20 a
session from the APHIS, sometimes more.
[SPEAKER_04]: In recent year, for example, the Malo
Sevesi Elite from Central Asia was
[SPEAKER_04]: imported.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of cider apple from
Northern Spain was introduced actually by
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Ian Merwin before he retired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago, a lot of cider from England
was introduced by Greg over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of different variety of
material from variety of different country
[SPEAKER_04]: in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also all this material take several
years to go to the quarantine system.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most extreme example are two of
the Malo's Elite material was collected in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1996 exploration.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was just released one month
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got notice from APHIS saying after 22
years, the material is finally released.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one more actually still in
quarantine, maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll wait and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So altogether in the last five years,
we introduced over 162 clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we collect over adding 306 C
accession to the Malo's collection in the
[SPEAKER_04]: last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have been selecting a lot of wild
seeding material and add to the permanent
[SPEAKER_04]: collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We add over 300 material accession to the
permanent collection in the last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So altogether almost 800 different new
accession will add to the collection in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here to show you why the APHIS quarantine
system takes so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major reason is it has to go
through biological indexing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any disease being found,
then they have to go through a tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: culture process, then go through a thermal
therapy and then go through shoe tip
[SPEAKER_04]: grafting, micro grafting of the material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then being retested again before they
can provisionally release to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll based on field observation for
additional two to three years before they
[SPEAKER_04]: can fully release.
[SPEAKER_04]: So normally this process take about at
least five years, but in extreme case,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a material being in the quarantine
for 23 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year there was an interesting
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Global Crop Diversity Trust together
with the Millennium Seabank at the Royal
[SPEAKER_04]: Bontani Garden in Kew, England.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're collecting 29 crop wild relatives
in 24 different countries, including the
[SPEAKER_04]: wild malus.
[SPEAKER_04]: This project was founded by government of
Norway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the malus collection, they decide
all the seed they collect, actually one
[SPEAKER_04]: third of all the seeds will stay at the
country of origin.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one third of the seed will be
stored at the Seabank in Kew Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after quite an intense discussion
for almost two weeks, they made a
[SPEAKER_04]: decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: The remaining one third of all the wild
malus seed they collected will come to
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva for evaluation, also
categorization.
[SPEAKER_04]: This including wild malus from seven
different countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the material from this country
will never have that in our collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very interesting and exciting,
hopefully to get the hands on this
[SPEAKER_04]: material from seven different countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next I want to tell you some of the story
we're getting involved in the last five
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in 2016, two years ago,
we propagate a whole bunch of 28 crop
[SPEAKER_04]: apple from belong to different wild malus
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are hybrid species from the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: National Arboretum.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a new director over there and he
made a decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to remove their entire malus
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the material we're able to
rescue and come to Geneva before they were
[SPEAKER_04]: completely removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also back in 2017 last year,
one of the material is a malus Halena from
[SPEAKER_04]: China.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually located at USDA Chico
Station since 1914.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally collected by Frank
Meyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once again, also in Sanxi area,
he collected material in 1994.
[SPEAKER_04]: In January, and then sent to Chico Station
in March.
[SPEAKER_04]: The material actually has been there for
the last almost 100 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow a colleague from the National
Plunger Policy System, Gary Gunnar and
[SPEAKER_04]: also Karen Willen was able to go to Chico
Station, identify the material and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the ball was sent to us for preservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually multi-pedal layer pedal
of crop apple material, wild apple
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will be interesting to see how it
looks like right here in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_04]: New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Karen Willen and also Gary
Gunnar, they also went to a former USDA
[SPEAKER_04]: Station introduction field station in
Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found a whole bunch of malus material
has been around since about 1920 and 1930.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're able to rescue about 11
material and we're gonna collect the ball
[SPEAKER_04]: and send to us for propagation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them, several crop apple,
red crop apple material from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call that Lake series, crop apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also three different wild malus
material either originally came from
[SPEAKER_04]: China, collect by Dorset in 1927 or from
Sichuan China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also one material from Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those material will rescue will come to
Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next I want to talk a little bit about the
maintenance of the malus collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically all the variety, we have trees
in the field and also we have a core
[SPEAKER_04]: collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: For malus collection, we have restored the
seed in minus 20 freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the dormant bower in the
prior preservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is showing some photo from the center
in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We test the viability by budding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for our routine maintenance of
safeguarding the material, we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: weeding, spraying, nursery operation,
also pruning during the winter time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing the list of all the
collection we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have over basically 7,000 in our
session right now in the total collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the permanent material have a tag
showing all the information or photo of
[SPEAKER_04]: the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is my predecessor Phil Forsline and
Dr. Herb Alwanko in 2013 during the bloom
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing some of the data from
our distribution record in the last eight
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically between 2010 and 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this view basically this is the
number of requests we got in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see in the last three years we
really have a high number of requests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually 2016 was a record.
[SPEAKER_04]: A record number of requests.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the total number of sample was not the
record.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we believe that 2018 might be a
record.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a lot of characterization
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the information about the material
actually stored in the Green Global
[SPEAKER_04]: Database.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also do a lot of study about the
chemical composition, the disease and the
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that is all stored in the Green Global
Database.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also in the last 20 years did a
tremendous amount of work in study the
[SPEAKER_04]: wild malus germplasm material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically a lot of disease related work
and also study of the material,
[SPEAKER_04]: different trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one particular material is
actually able to discover a new,
[SPEAKER_04]: brand new, highly resistant material
against blue mold in malus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing inoculation seven day
after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inoculation in the resistant material
versus the susceptible material.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a significant contrast between the
reaction after inoculation with blue mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two major code here control this trait
will map in chromosome number three and
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome number 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we do a lot of other study,
different trait with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also provide a lot of material for
different researcher everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the best example is actually the
publication by Velasco in 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genome of the domestic apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually in that study they used 74
accession.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually 46 of those accession actually
all came from Geneva collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last two year alone there's about
18 publication.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are directly involved with seven of
those using our germplasm material to
[SPEAKER_04]: carry out the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a GBS work since 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did a GWAS analysis using the GBS data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also we did a extensive re-sequencing
study with Dr. Luoyang Chen and Dr. Fei of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Thompson's research institute right
here in Geneva in Ithaca actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Study the history of domestication of a
modern day apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a showing diagrams actually two
step process for food size increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: One happened before domestication process.
[SPEAKER_04]: One actually happened during the
domestication process in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of work was together with Greg in
the last few years on the searching for
[SPEAKER_04]: the hard cider for New York which has
become one of the fastest growing sector
[SPEAKER_04]: of the industry for alcoholic beverage
industry in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg has studied the malice collection we
have looking for the best material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the Spanish cider material also right
now in the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to look into some of the wild
malice material.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a photo of actually a cider made
from a red flash material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost look like a red one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we are currently actually supporting
actually 19 different research ongoing
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them long time cooperation for
example with Dr. Susan Brown the apple
[SPEAKER_04]: reading program at Cornell University and
then also the apple root stop breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: program and a lot of different work in the
last couple years.
[SPEAKER_04]: People from Michigan State and Purdue
University Dr. Kenan Su right there in
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva doing a lot of food quality work
and also tree architectural trades
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a lot of sequencing work with
different researcher from different
[SPEAKER_04]: institution from Harvard University from
Chinese institution in England.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks from Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also some disease work and also insect
monitor work and also with Greg on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cider work and also with Dr. Lionel Chien
on the beta raw evaluation in the last two
[SPEAKER_04]: years with Ben over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also right now with Dr. Was Khan who's a
new faculty relative to new faculty at
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva and plant pathology working on
different disease related issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of we're supporting a lot
of cider variety testing right now because
[SPEAKER_04]: cider is getting so hot a lot of people
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're studying actually supporting
material for study in actually places like
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona, Georgia, California, Maine,
Michigan, Montana, New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_04]: New York of course Washington State and
also West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We study a lot of those material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have some unique requests in the
last couple years especially I think this
[SPEAKER_04]: request from the Smithsonian trying to get
the bark tissue from native wild species
[SPEAKER_04]: from Japan to study the yellow dye in the
use in the traditional Japanese painting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also very unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a lot of outreach a lot of
people visit our collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hobart-Williams Space College classes
several classes every year and also CBS
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday morning in Morocco last year
October visited collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell plant breeding courses 4060
actually come to the collection every year
[SPEAKER_04]: in September.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of researcher from
different country from China from Brazil
[SPEAKER_04]: and from many other country also the
grower extension personnel come to the
[SPEAKER_04]: collection all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last five years basically over 1500
visitors actually come to the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: 79 different group and classes so it's
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally I want to thank a lot of people
involved in the project and it's a very
[SPEAKER_04]: long list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here just showing some of the photo of
some of the folks we work together on the
[SPEAKER_04]: project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry I have to rush through the letter
half of the talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is technical the other is more looking
into the future type of question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is in that file of United
Tree you showed that there is a Sorbus
[SPEAKER_03]: outgroup there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many members are in that group or how
many exceptions in that group?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't quite remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back to look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asking in core plus DNA sequence
study of the malice relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Sorbus outgroup so he's asking
how many a session is in our group.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't quite remember so I have to go
back to look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the second question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking to the future how do you think the
PGRU should adapt to the research needs in
[SPEAKER_03]: the post genomics era?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because currently PGRU largely keeps one
or two trees per session.
For sequencing work that's absolutely
fine.
But for any other type of let's say you
know metabolomics or any physiology
[SPEAKER_03]: studies or I think one or two reps just
don't provide good information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think this situation is going to
get improved in the future in the next few
[SPEAKER_03]: years?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question that I just asked is how
we're going to adopt maybe in the future
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding currently that most of our
collection in the field we only have a
[SPEAKER_04]: single tree representation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably enough for genomic
genetic related study but that is probably
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough for additional kind of
physiology or other kind of studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have any idea how we're going to
move forward in the future regarding this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually that's actually quite an
extensive discussion on a continued basis
[SPEAKER_04]: for ourselves and actually also for the
entire colonal germplasm repository
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're facing a limitation on the resources
and also on the land also on the
[SPEAKER_04]: personnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very difficult trying to have more
than one copy of the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the people, most of the repository
actually have more than one copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we go with a single tree is
because we do have a very good
[SPEAKER_04]: biopreservation backup system right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 95% of all the permanent collection
we have in the collection actually they
[SPEAKER_04]: are back up in the biopreservation at Fort
Collins Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the reason we go with a single
tree representation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think moving forward there's discussion
trying to get some funding support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe trying to create maybe a new core
selection with better representation of
[SPEAKER_04]: the entire diversity and also including
some of the more important variety from
[SPEAKER_04]: recent in the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The core right now we have is almost 30
years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of information, different
selection could be including maybe this
[SPEAKER_04]: new core.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that's the direction we go with then
hopefully we can maybe have duplicate of
[SPEAKER_04]: the new core, maybe two or three of those
duplication either planning in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_04]: additional sign in Geneva or maybe trying
to work with other university such as the
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington State University and also maybe
with Kernsville, West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have land over there so we have
a copy of the new core over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can do that then we can probably
at least minimize some of this single
[SPEAKER_04]: representation issue for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a lot of people are really
obsessed with apples and I'm sad to see
[SPEAKER_01]: that so much of the genetic resources are
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to tap into people's obsession over
apples have you considered engaging the
[SPEAKER_01]: public and some of these science project
where they could report to you any what
[SPEAKER_01]: they think is an ancient tree on their
property for a long railroad like old
[SPEAKER_01]: railroad connecting east to west or east
to south because I've heard about this in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington that there was a nursery where
there was it's all a bunch of ancient tree
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and they primarily collected it
from abandoned farms and railroad sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wondered if you could engage them
you know people around the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: to give you the seeds or report to you
where these are located.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right actually there's a you're correct
there's a lot of public interest in apple
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically on something we call the
heirloom apple variety in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually I went to one of the first
heirloom apple meeting last year in Maine
[SPEAKER_04]: so there's actually different group
especially very active group in Maine in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado in Washington there's actually a
story just came out from Washington State
[SPEAKER_04]: about discovery of a fine new heirloom
apple variety and also we're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: a history professor actually in Georgia he
he's working on 15 heirloom apple variety
[SPEAKER_04]: he kind of rediscovered over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes we got constant requests actually
by the heirloom folks but it's very hard
[SPEAKER_04]: because we have limited space so the a lot
of private actually institutions stepping
[SPEAKER_04]: in in this regard for example the Sea
Saver Exchange in Iowa the currently their
[SPEAKER_04]: collection for heirloom apple is only
about 400 400 variety they actually plan
[SPEAKER_04]: to increase their collection of heirloom
variety up to 1,500.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's a Southern Heritage Apple
Orchard in North Carolina their collection
[SPEAKER_04]: currently have about 2,000 heirloom apple
variety and the group in Maine,
[SPEAKER_04]: Maine Heritage Foundation maybe they
currently have a collection about three to
[SPEAKER_04]: four hundred heirloom apple variety and
then there's more this going on in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado and Washington State and also
actually there are some interests I got
[SPEAKER_04]: phone call and contact on some of the
folks from New York actually just two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks ago on West Western part of New York
and also from other part of New York
[SPEAKER_04]: people asking a lot of this question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to help we're trying to
engage but we also limit what in what we
[SPEAKER_04]: could do so that's a very challenge but
we'll help them for example if they want
[SPEAKER_04]: to engage in genetic study so they need a
standard variety usually they will come to
[SPEAKER_04]: us we'll provide a sample for them to do
comparison genetic study for example we
[SPEAKER_04]: actually do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the heritage apple group actually
they are considering trying to come to
[SPEAKER_04]: Geneva for their annual meeting actually
