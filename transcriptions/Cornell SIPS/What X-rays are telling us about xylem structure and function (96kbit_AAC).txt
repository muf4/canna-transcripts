[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure to be here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is my first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use an old-fashioned pointer
so that the folks in Geneva can see me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see me in the pointer here,
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hear them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I hope they can hear and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll wave their hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they waving their hands?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm going to talk about is
actually kind of a simple study that we
[SPEAKER_03]: thought was going to be simple when we
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turned out to uncover some very
interesting aspects that we had not
[SPEAKER_03]: anticipated about something about xylem
structure and function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you may think that xylem that's been
studied for a very long time, but it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly well-known structure of different
kinds of cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's vessel members.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tracheids, fibers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming I don't have to introduce
these concepts to all of you plant science
[SPEAKER_03]: folks here in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of these are arranged in a tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, different species and
different groups of plants have different
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that was known from early on
is that the structure of xylem is fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are not just pipes that run
straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pipes that run crooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, this is about a 2 millimeter
by 30 centimeters, a 35 millimeter
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of been compressed vertically
so that you can see that these things kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of wander around.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that they're interconnected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, this section and this
section, this is all the way back from
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of the 70s, need to overlap one
another to actually, they're from the same
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just separated so that you can see
that there's a whole lot of spaghetti in
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had some questions about xylem
movement that we wanted to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that a complex
series of interconnected pipes will do,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is something that I did not know
before I talked to an engineer,
[SPEAKER_03]: any engineers in the audience,
is that you can actually, if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: three pipes, and one goes straight
through, one has a bit of a resistance,
[SPEAKER_03]: and another one has a bit more of a
resistance, and they're interconnected in
[SPEAKER_03]: this fashion, that even though water may
enter into this side on all three going
[SPEAKER_03]: that way, and water may exit on all three
on the other side due to a pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: differential, part of the system may be
flowing backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everybody okay with that idea that you
can actually have backwards flow even
[SPEAKER_03]: though it's coming in and going out the
same three tubes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be called, I think,
an emergent property of an interconnected
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: A system of pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very interesting property
because we were wondering whether reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: flow in this kind of system might explain
how vascular pathogens, that is xylem
[SPEAKER_03]: dwelling, in our case, do they know about
xylela facidiosa here, the cause of
[SPEAKER_03]: Pierce's disease in Grapevine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody know about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all the big headlines in California
a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a xylem dwelling bacteria that is
transmitted by a xylem-feeding insect,
[SPEAKER_03]: and usually the insect feeds in shoots in
the upper part of the canopy, but over
[SPEAKER_03]: years, the infection can get down into the
roots and kill the plant, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Pierce's disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if it's in the xylem,
how is it going backwards when the xylem
[SPEAKER_03]: is always supposed to be flowing towards
the leaves?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was somewhat of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: How a disease can spread downward,
but maybe if there's some of these that
[SPEAKER_03]: are flowing in reverse, that could account
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe these kind of interconnections,
whether it's downward or crossword,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we understood the interconnections,
then we could explain how embolism spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming everybody here understands a
little bit that the xylem system is under
[SPEAKER_03]: tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water under tension can cavitate or
embolize and sort of suck air,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say, cause an air bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: To occur in there and that can spread and
obviously wreak havoc with the system of
[SPEAKER_03]: transporting water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a couple of these questions,
and then we asked, well, do we know about
[SPEAKER_03]: how this system's interconnected in order
to answer these questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought, well, maybe we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to get a grant and harvest
a very good post-doc, Craig Brodersen,
[SPEAKER_03]: who has now got another post-doc at UC
Santa Cruz, and we sent him to our
[SPEAKER_03]: friendly neighborhood advanced synchrotron
light source in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what Berkeley looks like all the
time, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice picture of the San Francisco
Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where all the men are strong, all the
women are beautiful, and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: scientists are above average, but it's a
big place inside there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That went over much better when I was
talking in Minneapolis the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can put a plant inside here with
this x-ray source, and you can get a very
[SPEAKER_03]: high-resolution x-ray tomographic view,
a three-dimensional view of the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is a live plant, and we didn't
start with live plants, partly because
[SPEAKER_03]: this is an air stage and it has to rotate
in a very precise manner in order to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D image.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a lot easier to do that if all
you have is a stick of wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were only interested in the xylem
structure, so we began by just putting
[SPEAKER_03]: sticks of wood here and rotating them
around and getting this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll get back to the living plant in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we get with that, so I guess,
Neil, I forgot to tell you you should have
[SPEAKER_03]: brought some popcorn, but chips are
probably just as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example that I'm going to
just let play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of what the raw data looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you scan through this section,
as we're scanning down, this is across
[SPEAKER_03]: five millimeters.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the pith, and you can see that the
pith is sort of changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a dry piece of wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all the xylem vessels,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna stop this and rewind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of interesting things the pith
goes from being full of tissue to being
[SPEAKER_03]: empty, but that's not what's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's important is what's going on in all
these xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see is the big ones,
and they don't change much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But next time I play this now,
just take a look at some of these places
[SPEAKER_03]: where there are small cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pick a spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anywhere you pick, and I'm gonna
play, and what you're gonna find out is
[SPEAKER_03]: that these small cells kind of dance
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of fun doing this when we
were, and you see they appear and
[SPEAKER_03]: disappear and sometimes connect over and
sometimes move over, and there's a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: over here that just sort of shift
entirely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so the idea there is that we
get raw data that is just basically a
[SPEAKER_03]: stack of images.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to make movies out of this,
and it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't take so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a very high resolution and you
can start to see then how these sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: pie-shaped pieces between rays,
because that's what you have here,
[SPEAKER_03]: these are lined up radially in files,
and that sometimes there are vessels that
[SPEAKER_03]: go from one ray and connect over to
another ray, and a lot of times there are
[SPEAKER_03]: small vessels that interconnect these big
vessels, and there's a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: complexity in the way these vessels are
interconnected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we wanted to try to model
mathematically, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, so this is just an example of one
cross section with a pith labeled here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the grapevine bears leaves on either
side of the stem, of the shoot,
[SPEAKER_03]: and those are called the lateral sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because these are called lateral
sides, something has to be dorsal and
[SPEAKER_03]: something has to be ventral, I guess,
even though those are terms we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: normally use.
[SPEAKER_03]: for plants, but that's what this is called
dorsal ventral and then lateral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lateral sides you may be able to
see a little bit here look like they're a
[SPEAKER_03]: little squished in compared to the dorsal
ventral side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the vessels are a little bit smaller
than here, and we'll see a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: detail about some of those properties that
they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, they're sort of in radial
files separated by rays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just explains that in fact,
every pixel of this is about four and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half microns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have four and a half micron
pixels this way and also four and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: micron pixels this way vertically so that
they're called voxels, since they're a
[SPEAKER_03]: volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to analyze this, you can't
just do it on image J.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it on some kind of
software.
[SPEAKER_03]: Abizo software is kind of like image J on
steroids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do all kinds of interesting things
with this software.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to sort of take you
through a little quickly the process that
[SPEAKER_03]: we would go through to analyze a section.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd start with one slice somewhere in
the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I click down, you'll see
things change here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just keeping track of all the
processes that you've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the image will change depending on
what that process was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the first thing you do is you kind of
blur out the in-between parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see something showed up here and
you see almost no difference there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you noticed that,
but I'll just go up and down a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of gets a lot smoother in
between the cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of smooth things out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have actually no idea of all the
image analysis stuff that's being done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can explain what the results of it
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you've done that step, you can try to
sort of segment this into black versus
[SPEAKER_03]: white.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can play around with settings to
make it a little bit more white.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the nice thing about this
software is that when you pick a spot
[SPEAKER_03]: here, for instance, if you just click on
this, you know, the magic wand idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: I click here, then it will sort of connect
all of that same color, basically,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is black and white.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of the white that's not bounded,
and it'll connect it up and down from
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever you clicked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it'll also show vertical sections
through this thing, if you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a volume-oriented 3D
reconstruction software.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we have to have somebody go
through and click on these things and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, okay, that's a vessel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is you can take two of
these things, or one of them, and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: identify it and give it a name,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then turn it into just that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell the software, okay,
only show me what I've named here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they've been named by this guy,
Jacob, that's his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the undergraduate who was doing all
of the driving of this software.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can generate a volume rendering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a quick movie to sort of
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see right here a lot of dancing
around the vessels as it scans through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then basically, once you've identified
them, you can get sort of 3D renderings
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can rotate around, and it's a lot
of fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because it's done mathematically,
you can do virtual cross-sections this
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of the volume filling,
you can actually identify these and then
[SPEAKER_03]: have it tell you where is that volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in addition to the volume,
it can tell you where the midpoint of it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, where the edges of it are,
and how close it is to its nearest
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was all preliminary because what
we wanted to do was we wanted to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: how these things are interconnected and
make a model out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, but this software was
very helpful in being able to show when,
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance, you had a connection because
they were close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when there was space in between them,
when they diverged, when you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: through us, cross-section, you may see it
in this way when it's at one part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: stem and then farther apart when it's at
another part of the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can volume render that and see
what it's trying to tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have the question, well,
how close is close enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're this close, then are we going
to consider them connected or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And another question is when you have a
connection, then what's the hydraulic
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance for water flow through that
connection?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that actually can come from the
literature because some people have
[SPEAKER_03]: already looked at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we had to do is we had to go back
to the drawing board a bit and make a
[SPEAKER_03]: measurement on a cross-section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have introduced into one vessel at
the end of the stem what we call a
[SPEAKER_03]: fiduciary marker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the marker is just some silicon resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when we made a cross-section of
that and put that in the SEM, we could
[SPEAKER_03]: find out where that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we could identify from that which
vessels were close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we could look under the SEM in
detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you see a pit between two
vessels, then you know that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are typically the typical pit
fields between vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a pit membrane or middle amela
across them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those have been pretty well studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just showing the vessel-vessel
pits over here and the vessel to
[SPEAKER_03]: parenchyma pits over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what we could do is we could look
at all of the cells, how far they would be
[SPEAKER_03]: measured apart in the x-ray image,
and whether or not they had pits with
[SPEAKER_03]: adjacent vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a graph showing anywhere down
to about 8 or 10, 12, 14, by about 14
[SPEAKER_03]: microns between, then the amount of cells
with pits between them, the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: vessels with pits between them dropped off
sort of precipitously.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we figured if it's 14 microns or less
between, we're going to say that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's greater than 14 microns,
that's not a connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how we kind of calibrated the
distance, the information we could get
[SPEAKER_03]: from the x-ray from the anatomical
information about whether to call it a
[SPEAKER_03]: connection or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions about that so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that we discovered
was that we saw some of those vessels that
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of dance between big vessels,
the little ones that dance between big
[SPEAKER_03]: ones, actually we looked at those and
those are actually open.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know whether they'd be called a
pit or not anyway, but that was something
[SPEAKER_03]: we sort of discovered late that even,
that it may not be the typical vessel to
[SPEAKER_03]: vessel pit that has a pit membrane and has
a resistance across it, but rather an open
[SPEAKER_03]: pit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those might turn out to be, those will
turn out to be interesting in a later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so once you've decided how close they
need to be to be connected, then you can
[SPEAKER_03]: let the software go through and not only
trace the center of the vessel,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also trace where there were
connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all kind of off the shelf
automatic after you've gone through that
[SPEAKER_03]: process I described.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see sometimes it thinks that
there's connections right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: nowhere basically, and a lot of these
connections looked really crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ended up having to hire another
postdoc, Eric Lee, who is an engineer type
[SPEAKER_03]: guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was able to develop the algorithms
that we needed to take what a Viso
[SPEAKER_03]: software told us and actually turn it into
something that we thought was more
[SPEAKER_03]: realistic and that he could actually model
as far as flow was concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went ahead and checked
whether, checked what the data looked like
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of where the connections were and
so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing for instance, was if you
consider a vessel where zero degrees is in
[SPEAKER_03]: the radial direction and 90 degrees is 90
degrees from that, the connections are
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly at zero degrees with some at 90
degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the dorsal ventral zone,
same thing in the lateral zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this made a lot of sense because
generally, vessels are in radial files.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be a zero degree connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're also usually next to if
they're going to be connected,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd be connected at right angles to
that rather than at sort of just any old
[SPEAKER_03]: angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was just so that's just one
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a bunch of descriptions,
you know, that the dorsal ventral vessels
[SPEAKER_03]: are generally bigger than the lateral
vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're closer to the pith and more
interconnected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all of this is just descriptive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we really wanted was we really wanted
to make take all of this interconnected
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff on a particular stem or a particular
section of stem and make a mathematical
[SPEAKER_03]: model, a flow model, an engineering model
about how water would flow through this
[SPEAKER_03]: system, because that's what we were really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what Eric did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took we took a bunch of information
from the literature, about, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: what the pores, the pore size distribution
would be in a typical pit, what the pit
[SPEAKER_03]: conductivity would be in a bunch of other
stuff, and came up with a flow,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically from one pressure at one side to
another pressure at the other side,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to see how this would behave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the first ever run that we
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this shows is in the red color,
it's flow going in one direction,
[SPEAKER_03]: it actually doesn't matter which one,
but let's say from the bottom to the top,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the blue direction and its intensity
is flow going in the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So already, in this particular section
that we that we analyze, we've already got
[SPEAKER_03]: enough complex interconnections and enough
differences in resistance and so on,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can get flow in the wrong
direction in a reasonable model of what
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, what the xylem would be
like in a grapevine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of the things we wanted to
ask the question about, whether you can
[SPEAKER_03]: have reverse flow and you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing has to do with embolism
spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to embolism repair a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is there any pattern that you can see
that relates to the structure of the
[SPEAKER_03]: xylem, or do things just embolize,
let's say randomly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's an example of a living stem
now, and notice that you don't see many of
[SPEAKER_03]: the vessels, and that's because there are
a whole bunch of other vessels that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can actually pick out by eye, but they are
almost the same color as the background,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're filled with water,
and x-rays are basically telling you the
[SPEAKER_03]: density of the tissue, and that's mostly
the density of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, all of these vessels that
you see here are embolized vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was on a stem of a plant that we
dried out on purpose, then took it to
[SPEAKER_03]: Berkeley, then set it up in this x-ray,
and then x-rayed it for a number of hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: and got sequential images along this five
millimeter section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the images showed was all the
ones in blue here were the ones that were
[SPEAKER_03]: already cavitated, already embolized,
when we started, so at time zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through the rest of the eight and a
half hours, you can see how it spread as
[SPEAKER_03]: the colors go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see colors very well, but you can
see a couple of embolizing here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that you could see very
clearly was that they tended to embolize
[SPEAKER_03]: in groups corresponding to that radio
file, which makes sort of sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: because those are the ones that are
typically inter-connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had some cases where, so if you
look down at this lower half, for
[SPEAKER_03]: instance, this group, which I think is
red, I'm red-green colorblind,
[SPEAKER_03]: so is this a red color here?
[SPEAKER_03]: This group in red embolized at the same
time that this group in blue, is that
[SPEAKER_03]: blue?
[SPEAKER_03]: This group in blue, and this is yellow or
green?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got a red file and a blue file,
and this yellow guy, and if you scan
[SPEAKER_03]: through, you find that that yellow guy
switched allegiance here from the red to
[SPEAKER_03]: the blue, somewhere in that section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see in the 3D reconstruction,
it's going from being connected to a red
[SPEAKER_03]: guy to being connected to a blue guy here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that explains why all of these things
would embolize at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: is because they were connected by one of
these, by the yellow guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in terms of sort of conclusions
for this part of the work, we think that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can use high-res CAT scanning to
construct accurate 3D models of how the
[SPEAKER_03]: Xylem is interconnected, and it's a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot less work than doing everything
by hand, but it's still a lot of work,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 3D software to rotate these
images and make virtual sections through
[SPEAKER_03]: them is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see a lot of interesting things,
like those bridging cells that we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: even know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the idea of backflow and
perhaps spread of Xylem-dwelling bacteria
[SPEAKER_03]: may be important, that the complexity of
interconnections and the idea that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: have backflow may be important for that,
and also that those 3D interconnections
[SPEAKER_03]: may be very important for the pattern of
embolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions about that so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm used to kind of interacting a little
bit more with the class, so I really
[SPEAKER_03]: encourage you to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everybody's embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gaps, the interconnections,
what's the space there, and how does that
[SPEAKER_02]: relate to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dian space?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me see now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were thinking about this gap,
that gap is the, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the bay bridge for Xylola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Xylola can get through there no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is essentially open.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pores in the pit membranes of a
typical vessel-to-vessel connection,
[SPEAKER_03]: those are too small for Xylola.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thinking is that the Xylola
excrete enzymes that degrade carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_03]: and they digest their way through those,
probably causing a cavitation when that
[SPEAKER_03]: happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's where the spread of the
bacteria and the anatomy of the Xylem and
[SPEAKER_03]: its 3D interconnections, that's kind of
where these things converge to the same
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of question.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we wanted to model this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the model that I showed hasn't
included these kind of connections yet
[SPEAKER_03]: because we sort of discovered those after
we had figured out the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you calculate
[SPEAKER_02]: these?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I don't know, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, you hire a postdoc who knows
how to do that, then that solves it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Eric is actually a postdoc in
engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the values that you can get from
the literature about, well, one value,
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance, is just a Poisson equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a given diameter of vessel and the
flow through that, that's easy,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hard one is how hard is it for water
to go from here and go across when there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a pit connection?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it turns out, there are ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can take a piece of stem and you
can glue, using super glue, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: glue a glass capillary that's been pulled
down pretty fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glue a capillary into one vessel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can send water with some dye
through there and look at the other end
[SPEAKER_03]: and see where that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, usually what we try to do,
then you can glue up that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it comes out of an adjacent vessel
and the vessels are fairly close,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you can be pretty confident that they
are connected in between there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can measure the flow coming
in and going out and the pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: differential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can calculate a sort of a
hydraulic conductivity of that junction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done a little bit of that in our
lab, but other folks have done a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: that in their labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that pit conductivity is something that
we just put into this hydraulic equation,
[SPEAKER_03]: along with all the other typical
assumptions of a hydraulic equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you an engineer type guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very complex set of equations,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've got all these vessels and
all these interconnections.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we had to hire Eric to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no idea how this would work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just said, let's just model this based
on physical principles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I doing time wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not obvious to me why they're,
from a pressure grading point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: why they're.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you should have stopped me way back
when I was talking about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you didn't say it was OK at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if the pressure here at this
connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say for a moment that this
connection has very little resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the pressure here is higher than the
pressure here, then water is going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: back that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just make up a scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all equal size pipes with
slightly different resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this one has some resistance,
then the pressure downstream of this
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance is going to be lower than this
pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this one has a lot more of
resistance, then the pressure here is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be a lot lower than that
pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they both may be lower than this
pressure here with no resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, this is really, from here to
here, is just a connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's oriented backwards or
whether it's oriented to the side,
[SPEAKER_03]: and to some extent, doesn't really make
any difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the water doesn't know that it's going
backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just flowing downhill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's just hand waving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently, the engineer guys have
known this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are a young engineer and you
design a system of pipes and this does it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get fired or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually, you don't want things to work
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's why they always use
pipes of the same diameter, because then
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have that big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about embolism spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to quickly now talk just
about this repair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at first, we were just putting
sticks in the HRCT.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided, and I don't remember
whether Craig wanted to do this or Mark
[SPEAKER_03]: Matthews, my colleague, said, let's put a
live plant in there and see if we can see
[SPEAKER_03]: embolisms or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the guys at Berkeley said,
you guys are nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go anywhere near that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have anything living in that
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all the shielding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just thought the plant was just
going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it didn't die.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the plants, we brought them back
out to the greenhouse and they were fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as background, though,
other people have used NMR or MRI,
[SPEAKER_03]: nuclear magnetic resonance or magnetic
resonance imaging, to say that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: been vessels that are embolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a corn root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see these three black dots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's only one black dot because
the other two are full.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that water has filled these
vessels that were embolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been around for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you can see, the resolution's not
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a corn root with really big
vessels, then you can see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually got a little better resolution
on grapevines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also able to show, so this is a
living plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see them light up here and
where there was two dark ones here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, the resolution's not great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put a living plant in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for instance, we would make a CT scan
of this plant that showed some dark
[SPEAKER_03]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means cavitated vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could look and see on the
image that there were vessels that were
[SPEAKER_03]: water filled, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could kind of line that up with a
hand section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, this is pointing to,
number one's pointing to two adjacent
[SPEAKER_03]: vessels here that we would say are
connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the big one is embolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little one is full of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as we started looking at
these, we saw these little blobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These little warts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought, what the heck are those
things?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of the vessels are round.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we saw one that are like moon shaped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are those blobs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thought was maybe those blobs
are little water droplets that are
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to refill these vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Martin Canney had already come up with
this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as background, I probably should have
said this already.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that we get embolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been lots of evidence that
embolism can be somehow reversed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have a loss of hydraulic
conductivity in the day and then a gain of
[SPEAKER_03]: hydraulic conductivity during the night or
maybe sometimes later in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the search was on for finding out
how the heck a xylem vessel can be empty
[SPEAKER_03]: at one time of the day and the whole
system's under tension and yet can somehow
[SPEAKER_03]: refill later that day or maybe overnight
when the system's under tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Martin Canney had used cryo SEM and
found little drops and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe it's water being sort of pushed in
there by the adjacent cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem with cryo, of course,
is that you're never sure if it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: artifact or not because you freeze it and
water can distill and condense and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of got left alone for a while
while everybody was chasing after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also these droplets, now you can see
that they, in this virtual long section,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they look a little bit more like
drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of look a little bit like
thyloses, but obviously thyloses are a
[SPEAKER_03]: permanent thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not a drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an outgrowth of an adjacent
parenchyma cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we basically just kept looking at
these and finally once we got the 3D sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of reconstruction figured out,
we were, we, you know, to our,
[SPEAKER_03]: to our amazement realized that what we
were seeing was drops and they may be
[SPEAKER_03]: drops that you could see clearly as
individual drops or they may be things
[SPEAKER_03]: that were sort of more big blobs which may
have been drops that just coalesced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we could do is we could look at
the same section over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be an example of an
experiment where we took a grapevine,
[SPEAKER_03]: dried it out real good, came in at zero
time, and this is just one long section
[SPEAKER_03]: from one section where you can see three
pretty clear vessels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we would maybe rewater the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in one case, in the first plant we did,
we actually just put it in there and at
[SPEAKER_03]: time zero we saw this and then you could
see that there was drops or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just left the vine alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't rewater it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time it refilled itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes if the vine is very,
the plant is very stressed, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: water it and then it will refill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it just does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was ready to do it on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see over time and finally at
about four hours everything had been
[SPEAKER_03]: refilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know, we don't have minute by
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like every 30 minutes or so that
we can scan this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clearly things were getting refilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see a lot of interesting
detail about, you know, one of the last
[SPEAKER_03]: things to go might be a bubble in the
middle of the vessel or on the side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that four hours with sunlight or four
hours in the dark?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is four hours in the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also because of the shaking,
because of the way you have to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hold the plant, I think I showed
what the, yeah, because of the way you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to hold this plant, everything is
sort of enclosed anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has got its head sticking up
above.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so you would expect that it's low
transpiration conditions for sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, if since the, since the
software will allow you to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, I'm going to identify this vessel or
this vessel or this vessel, then you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it will also say, I'm going to
identify these things as drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me everywhere that they're connected
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it'll sort of show you all those
drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can actually calculate the volume
of the vessel and the volume of the drops
[SPEAKER_03]: and the volume by difference of the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this shows, for instance, some four
vessels and how that, how they ultimately
[SPEAKER_03]: all had no air at six hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we were able to track
individual drops, at least in the early
[SPEAKER_03]: part of this process, we could say,
how big is the volume of that drop now
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to how big it is two hours from
now or four hours from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could actually calculate a droplet
growth rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could take all the drops in all the
surface area of that vessel and calculate
[SPEAKER_03]: how fast it should take a vessel to fill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, the white circles are our
calculation based on a drop growth rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not crop growth rate drop on an
independent sample then from what we
[SPEAKER_03]: actually observed for these things as to
how quick the vessel could be filled up
[SPEAKER_03]: with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see really good agreement,
little disagreement here, but basically
[SPEAKER_03]: the vessels seem to be filling in a
consistent manner with what we calculate
[SPEAKER_03]: for a drop to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, there are some vessels
that start filling that is lower air
[SPEAKER_03]: volume and then the air volume comes up
and may wander around and may never go to
[SPEAKER_03]: zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show some details about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we would call as refilling
failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we zoom in on this thing here,
we see it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see some drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drops here, some drops here, some big
blobs drop here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from, you know, I don't know,
it's magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, for instance,
we've got zero up to six hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: At six hours, this one lonely vessel here,
which is this guy, has not filled.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the other ones next to it have
filled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a whole bunch of little ones and a
lot of drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this whole group is here and it's
full.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it's not for lack of trying
because by zooming in on that one vessel,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that there are drops growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm assuming that now by this
point that these things are growing over
[SPEAKER_03]: time and that they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is well, so this would be an
example of where this filling attempt
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow fails and it ends up being
completely embolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes sense if these things are
filling and then after being full,
[SPEAKER_03]: they come under tension as the normal part
of the xylem is under tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then maybe this one just cannot keep up
with that and gets empty because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: tension in the rest of the xylem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least that's the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as sort of a sideline, you can get
lots of very cool pictures of this sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D and you could zoom through there and
get CSIC doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The droplets appear to be forming
preferentially on the sides that are next
[SPEAKER_03]: to the radial parenchyma cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not a new idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people have speculated that this was
going on, but I think now we have sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: the first evidence that it does go on in
vivo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that you've got the radial
parenchyma cells here that it's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: carbohydrates because if you girdle,
you can slow this process down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not our work, but other folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way we can explain it is that the
cells transport sugars or whatever into
[SPEAKER_03]: the adjacent xylem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That those sugars then osmotically from
all the rest of this tissue draw water in
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's what causes the water drop to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can get growth over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it happens to connect to an adjacent
xylem, an adjacent vessel that's under
[SPEAKER_03]: tension, then that's probably not fast
enough to keep that water from flowing
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it is fast enough, which means that
this is where things get interesting,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we don't think this system when
they're refilling is all under tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be that there's other xylem in
other places that are under tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly when we measure the bulk of
the tissue, we get a low water potential
[SPEAKER_03]: value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we presume that it's under tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it may be that this is a very local
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that when you've got a bunch of cells,
they tend to do this in groups,
[SPEAKER_03]: all sort of trying to refill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very teleological.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a teleologist, but I think it's
pretty much what we think is going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That maybe even in the ones that we think
are full, maybe they're also getting
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon from their adjacent parenchyma
cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that they're kind of relieving
the tension by adding some pumping into
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while they're being relieved of
tension, all the rest of these guys can
[SPEAKER_03]: refill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that after they're done filling,
then the whole system can come back under
[SPEAKER_03]: tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least this is our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have evidence anyway that the drop
growth rate can explain the refilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have evidence that drops congeal and
the space gets less and less.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have evidence that bubbles can be right
in the middle of the vessel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next time we see them,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So presumably they've gotten compressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need a little bit of, it can't be
under tension for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have evidence that the bubbles can
be near the edge and disappear,
[SPEAKER_03]: which could mean that the air is sort of
going out into the apple class somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But bottom line, I think the weight of the
evidence is strongly favoring the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar or some kind of carbohydrate
transport followed by osmosis and just
[SPEAKER_03]: water movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why those vessels might not be under
tension?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any evidence to suggest that the
end pours into the asylum, in an embolized
[SPEAKER_04]: section of the asylum?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Missy Holbrook at Harvard came up with the
idea some time ago that the pits,
[SPEAKER_03]: so actually it's not just the ends that
are a concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ends and the sides and
everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the whole tissue is under tension,
then how is it that you can get water
[SPEAKER_03]: under maybe slight pressure or let's say
no tension anyway, filling these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as it touches a side that's in
continuity with anything under tension,
[SPEAKER_03]: it should just get sucked right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she came up with the idea that the
reason why pits are designed the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: are is that there might be a little bit of
a hydrophobic pocket right around the pit
[SPEAKER_03]: so that when water is filling this,
it actually doesn't wet the pit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part of the pit that connects it to
the adjacent cell and that it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: just at the last moment when the pressure
is enough to cause all of those things to
[SPEAKER_03]: make a connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way you could say that that's like
closing off the connections until they're
[SPEAKER_03]: ready to be connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
