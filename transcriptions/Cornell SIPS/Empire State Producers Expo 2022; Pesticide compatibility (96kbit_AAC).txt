[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, everyone, for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks so much for your introduction,
Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to first introduce my program a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Steve did as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do a little bit of an
introduction of the resources we have for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to define
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll kind of get into the meat
of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we'll be talking about
how to avoid incompatibility issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Steve said, I'm the director and
educator with our program, Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperative Extension Pesticide Safety
Education Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go by CCEPSEP, and we were formerly
PMEB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been a leader in pesticide
safety education for over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve mentioned that we provide
training, we answer questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we serve as an objective source of
information about pesticides for both
[SPEAKER_00]: applicators and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what might be of interest to you is we
have applicator certification manuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we write and publish those manuals,
which you can use to study for your
[SPEAKER_00]: certification exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can purchase those online through
the Cornell store at the link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the manuals of interest to you would
include probably fruit and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have category 22 and 23,
and we also have the core manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, in addition to the live
talks that I'm giving today, we give talks
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, but we also give on-demand
recertification courses that are online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just go to our distance
learning center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little bit harder to read,
but you can see there's a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: talks for recertification credits in New
York state and also nine other Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cover core and category topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be of interest to you if
you're looking to get some more credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also publish the Cornell Crop
and Pest Management Guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently selling the 2022
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guidelines that might be of interest
to you are probably vegetable,
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, fruit, and barrier out, also field
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can purchase those online as well
at the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now that I've kind of shown off our
program resources a little bit here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little bit of housekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this talk, there's some pesticide
trade names that are included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sole purpose of having those trade
names in there is to explain common
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not endorsing the products mentioned
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't mention something,
it's not because I'm criticizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please note that I'm only sharing
sections of the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to read the entire label specific
to your product before you go to purchase,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, load, store, or apply it to make sure
you're using that product correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now that we've gotten through all that
housekeeping, let's get into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about incompatibility,
the first thing I kind of want to zoom out
[SPEAKER_00]: first and really talk about why do we run
into this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mainly, it's tank mixing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the benefits of tank
mixing first before we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many upsides to tank mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help you make more timely
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You often have a very narrow window of
time where your pest is in the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: life stage and weather conditions to allow
for you to effectively use chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: controls, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And mixing multiple products in one
application can reduce expenses associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with labor, time, wear, and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also reduce soil compaction or
crop damage just by not going out as
[SPEAKER_00]: often, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can improve control with tanks
mixing by hitting a pest with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also manage multiple
pests in one application by, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing an herbicide and an insecticide
together or combining pre- and
[SPEAKER_00]: post-emergent herbicides to manage
multiple different species of weeds at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of benefits to tank
mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you tank mix, you have to make
sure the following things are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that none of the
pesticide labels prohibit that mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the timing is right for efficacy of
each pesticide against the target pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the application method that you're
using is appropriate for all pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure that mixing
those pesticides won't lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're going to focus on
today is the incompatibility piece of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, let's define incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So incompatibility occurs when you're
mixing two or more pesticide products
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and that negatively influences
how the other pesticide products in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tank disperse, mix, and deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, incompatibility is where one
or more of your pesticide products are no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer effective for pest control because
you mix them with another product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two types of incompatibility
that we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got physical incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the more obvious one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the failure of pesticide products to
stay uniformly mixed in the spray tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see all sorts of
horrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen some of these pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products fail to stay uniformly mixed,
so you're seeing separation into layers
[SPEAKER_00]: and putties and paste, clogging of screens
and nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is difficult to clean, and it can
render the products ineffective or
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have some of that left in
your tank, those residues can cause injury
[SPEAKER_00]: to your crops later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not cleaned properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other type of incompatibility is
chemical incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this occurs when you're mixing two
pesticides together, or two or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the activity of one of those
pesticides is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see reduced efficacy or
even undesirable crop damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only indication often of chemical
incompatibility is the lack of results or
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever mixed a tank application
in a field that was mysteriously
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective, that's probably due to a
chemical incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rarely visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of which type of
incompatibility you have, there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: negative consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to repeat the applications
to control your pests or even switch
[SPEAKER_00]: products if repeat application violates
the label direction on that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you applied, spilled, or have to
dispose of the mixture, then the resultant
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture, that can be considered an
environmental contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it didn't provide any benefit for
pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incompatibility wastes time, money,
and product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we talked about a little bit,
it can damage your equipment and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: also injure your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with phytotoxicity,
there's a lot of obvious incentives to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoiding incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're going to talk
about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just kind of an overview of
what we'll talk about today, mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on avoiding incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about only mixing a few
things, reading the label, mixing in
[SPEAKER_00]: order, mixing correctly, knowing your
carrier properties, conducting jar tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for multiple factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we'll talk about
resolving incompatibility if it should
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of what we'll talk about today is
avoiding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first way to avoid compatibility
issues is to only mix a few products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing fewer products reduces your chance
of incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get into why this is, let's talk
about what goes into your tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already discussed you're putting
pesticides in your tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about things like
herbicides, fungicides, insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on a pesticide formulation,
they might respond differently to things
[SPEAKER_00]: like temperature, water, pH, storage
conditions, mixing in the carrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mixing with other pesticide products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what makes up a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember back to your core
training, a pesticide formulation is the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient plus the inert
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together that makes up the formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we have Roundup Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a broad spectrum post-emergence
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pesticide product name is Roundup
Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active ingredient is glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see highlighted here,
it's a specific salt form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 58% or 59% of this product is
listed as other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the inert ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably familiar with a lot of
these inert ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do is they improve efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the active ingredient is the thing
that's actually preventing, destroying,
[SPEAKER_00]: repelling, and mitigating the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inert ingredients actually
improving efficacy, shelf life,
[SPEAKER_00]: application ease, and applicator safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can do things like reduce
degradation from sunlight, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or help penetrate the active ingredient
into a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so inert ingredients include things
like solvents and anti-drift and wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agents, antifreeze and pH buffers,
defomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing two or more
pesticides together, when you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: how complicated the formulation can be,
it makes sense that simply because of
[SPEAKER_00]: those complex formulations, you might see
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's often the inert ingredients
that can pose as incompatibility issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about everything else that goes
into your tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got fertilizers, macronutrients,
micronutrients, plant growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray dyes, biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these substances can interact
with one another and with the water and
[SPEAKER_00]: with your pesticides and the carrier's pH
and the temperature and the mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content, resulting in incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really why if you can reduce
the number of products that you're mixing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have less chance of
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'd be remiss as a pesticide safety
educator if I didn't talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing pesticides together,
you have to follow the strictest label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you've heard of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just take an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got product A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product A requires REI of eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product B is four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So product A is a little more strict here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then product A requires chemical
resistant gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product B requires those gloves,
but also protective eyewear and a
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're mixing these two together,
what REI are we going to be expecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: what level of PPE?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be the strictest from
each thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you mix things together,
basically the hazards posed by each
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide are still present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever hazards there were that
required product A to have that eight hour
[SPEAKER_00]: REI, that's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing for product B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was a respiratory concern,
maybe an inhalation hazard of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still going to be true when you mix
things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you follow the strictest
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next way to avoid incompatibility
is to read the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, product labels can tell you a lot of
different things regarding compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have statements about other
products that are tested for compatibility
[SPEAKER_00]: with your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the order in which to add
products, recommendations for tank mix
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation, products not to mix,
sensitivities to temperature, warnings
[SPEAKER_00]: about pH or water hardness, recommended
carrier volume, and whether you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: tank mix and adjuvant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those things can be on the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want you to keep in mind that
compatibility issues are only sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: and not always mentioned on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in red here, I'm just going to give you
one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this example of other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes the label will list other
products tested for compatibility with
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't always do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So companies will test formulations with
other products that applicators might
[SPEAKER_00]: apply during the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do not account for every possible
tank mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just an example that you
really got to make sure to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's not always going to be on the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, when it comes down to it,
you're the one that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing if the products in your tank are
compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, what we're talking about
today will help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the major reasons that mixtures
become incompatible, are we seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility issues, is that products are
mixed in the incorrect order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing order is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by talking about mixing
order with water as your carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to touch on fertilizer as
your carrier next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to do, like I just
stressed, is to read and follow any
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions on the label and contact the
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can contact our program with any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the label touches on mixing at all,
you have to follow with the label set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the label doesn't talk about the mixing
order, then there's this generic order
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to present to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the generic order if your label
doesn't say anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rule of thumb procedure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're going to do is you're going
to agitate liquid products in their
[SPEAKER_00]: containers as per the label instructions
to ensure that they're thoroughly mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: before you add them to the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to add your water to the
tank, and usually recommend about 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the required volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to start agitation
of that tank before you even add the first
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to continue agitation
throughout the mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to add products to your
tank in order based on formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in blue here, I'm going to give you the
order, the formulation order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not otherwise specifying the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the order you're going to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you want to add water soluble
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to add your dry
formulations, including dry flowables and
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because these formulations
must be mixed with water carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: With moderate agitation, you want those
particles to break apart and the
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactants to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, if you follow the mixing
order that we just talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you already have been agitating the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will already be starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you want to make sure to give your
dry formulations enough wait time to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly mix the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this is that you really should
be only adding one of these at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to add the dry products one at
a time and then wait for each of them to
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse before you add the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will give time for them to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also then, if you encounter
incompatibility, you're going to lose less
[SPEAKER_00]: product because you'll catch it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to mix them all
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the water soluble packets,
you want to visually ensure that those
[SPEAKER_00]: bags have fully dissolved and the product
has dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rule of thumb for each of these
dry formulations is about three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this can really vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to touch on this later in
the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the factors that can change
that wait time is the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that can be added is the
dry or liquid ammonium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this step, you could add the dry or
solid anti-drift agents and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility agents and anti-foamers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to wait two,
three minutes after you add the
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility agents and anti-foamers
before you march the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while we have compatibility agents
and anti-foamers as step five in this
[SPEAKER_00]: generic order, you want to keep in mind
that they're not necessarily subject to a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical mixing order protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to check for those
defoamers and the compatibility agents and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if the label says anything about when
to add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with the anti-foamers,
you're kind of putting those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you want to put those in
throughout the mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure to check the labels
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, you're going to add all liquid
formulations that have dispersed active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, such as suspension
concentrates, SUSPO emulsions,
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsions in water, microcapsules,
and flowables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this picture shows a suspension in
water on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you do is if you're
planning to add emulsifiable concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: or ECs, to your mixture, you'll want to
add polymer-based drift retardants first
[SPEAKER_00]: in step seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to add those liquid drift
retardants, and that allows the EC
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation to absorb water and avoid
clumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then next, you would add those
remaining liquid formulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include the emulsifiable
concentrates and also oil dispersions and
[SPEAKER_00]: salt solutions or soluble liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the ECs are oil or
solvent-based products, they require more
[SPEAKER_00]: time to disperse throughout the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture shown here shows an emulsion
in water on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, emulsions appear milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, you're going to add any remaining
adjuvants, such as crop oil concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: high surfactant oil concentrates,
methylated seed oils, non-ionic
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactants, spreader stickers,
and water conditioning agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to add
micronutrients and liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you know the order to mix,
let's talk about why it's so important
[SPEAKER_00]: that things are mixed in this order,
if not otherwise stated in the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really comes down to formulation and
the properties of the products with these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific formulation types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highlighted those in yellow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we mentioned, dry formulations
require agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The particles must break apart and must
dissolve in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspensions, such as SUSPO emulsion and
suspension concentrates, are suspended in
[SPEAKER_00]: water with a thickener or premixed with
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that oil often stays in the tank
surface once you add those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then emulsifiable concentrates,
they contain surfactants in their
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation that keep the oil droplets
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about two different
things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about something that needs
to disperse in water and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're talking about, you know,
other products that have oils or
[SPEAKER_00]: thickeners in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can imagine that if we were to
add the dry ingredients second,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would happen is they would hit that
oil that's already on top of the tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that oil would coat them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to sink down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be able to interact
and disperse in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is why you want to add those
dry ingredients first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you add the products in this
order, the next thing you do when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing is you're going to add the
remaining water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to continue agitation until
the tank mix appears uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to measure the pH and
water hardness to determine the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of water conditioners or ammonium
sulfate that you might need to add if the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it's always a good rule of thumb
to check the pH after you've mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you want to keep in mind that
pH adjusters are not always added at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the label will tell you when to add
them so you might have to add at a
[SPEAKER_00]: different time during the mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about pH and also
water hardness a little bit later on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about the mixing order here,
but it's important to stress that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the order to follow only if the product
labels do not have their own instructions
[SPEAKER_00]: for mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've said that a couple of times
here, but I want to give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my example is SenStar, and I heard from
a New York State Extension associate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cornell Cooperative Extension
Vegetable Program, Christy Hopetig,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this new product, SenStar,
for control of onion thrips on onion,
[SPEAKER_00]: among other sites and pests, had some tank
mixing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was happening is it was forming
into a glob that had to be disposed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't be sure exactly what the
source of these tank mixing issues was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the tank mixing order
on the SenStar label, you can see that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't follow the generic mixing order
that I just showed you for most
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, it jumps around quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the numbers I have here
correspond to the generic mixing order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that SenStar label requires
you to add oil dispersions in the third
[SPEAKER_00]: step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, this wouldn't happen until
the eighth step under the generic mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like this are exactly why it's
really important to read the label to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've just been talking about
mixing with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if your carrier is fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What adjustments should you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: So most pesticide products are actually
designed to be used with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water tends to be a better carrier
then for those products and tank mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems is that liquid
fertilizers are essentially a concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: salt solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's going to be less water
available to help disperse your dry
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So incompatibility is more likely to occur
when you have fertilizer as your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the salts can also mix with inert
ingredients in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing this, it makes sense that you
see some changes to the mixing order with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you're going to see that you
should always conduct a jar test with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer as your carrier to avoid that
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're using fertilizer
carriers, you never want to premix crop
[SPEAKER_00]: protection products in an inductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some products are not designed to be
added directly to liquid fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to water carrier, you want to make
sure to agitate the fertilizer mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: before adding the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's even more important with
fertilizer because things are less likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to disperse compared to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with fertilizer, you always want to
check for incompatibilities after mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're more likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a big change here to the
order that you want to add your products
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that you are encouraged to
make these pre-slurries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with fertilizer, you want to make
pre-slurries in water with these dry
[SPEAKER_00]: products before you put them into the
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps them dissolve before they
even go into the fertilizer carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about pre-slurries a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two pictures on the right show an
example of a dry herbicide being added
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to urea and ammonium nitrate on
the top versus being mixed in a pre-slurry
[SPEAKER_00]: with water and then added to the
fertilizer carrier on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that that pre-slurry made
a huge difference in terms of dispersion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are there still layers here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this hasn't been agitated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would help get rid of the layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see pre-slurries are really
important for fertilizer carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, when you're mixing a
pre-slurry, you want to reduce exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be an inhalation hazard
with those dry ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be increased risk of
sloshing and sloshing because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing in an open bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to label language and
make sure to wear PPE, including gloves,
[SPEAKER_00]: eye and skin protection in cases of
splashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take extra care when you pour that
into the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've talked about the mixing
order for both water and fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's discuss the three main things you
want to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about mixing
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we'll talk about is
carrier volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like when you're adding sugar to
your tea, if you don't have enough water,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sugar is going to precipitate out and
not dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll end up at the bottom of your
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is similar with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to make sure to add the
right amount of water so pesticides will
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're going to get product
clumping at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the directions on the label
state that the tank should be half full of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and three-fourths full of fertilizer
before you add the first product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, let's talk about wait time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already went over wait time a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just want to make sure to check
that each of your products have mixed and
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough time to mix before you add the
next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to agitate those products before
you add another product, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: the active ingredients do not disperse or
suspend quickly in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that a product may appear
to have dispersed when it actually hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it appears dissolved,
it actually might need a little more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then note that mixing time can be a
lot slower when water is colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, let's discuss agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to agitate your tank mixtures
moderately before and during spray
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I mean by moderate agitation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're doing moderate agitation,
you're going to be able to see that top
[SPEAKER_00]: layer of your mixture moving when you look
into the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like boiling water,
that's too much agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so important to not over or
under agitate?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over agitate, what you're going to
get is dry product formulations will foam
[SPEAKER_00]: when they remain at the top and they'll
swell and sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can lead to uneven dispersion or
even clogged and stop pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get pesticides dislodging
from their surfactants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can destabilize the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get clumping and cottage cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anti-drift agents can shear if
things are over agitated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will lead to diminishing
effectiveness during the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moderate agitation and also adding that
anti-foaming agent should help ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: products are dispersed without foaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can also under mix your products
and under agitate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens then is that you're going
to see things settling out over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you'd see with Italian salad
dressing breaking into layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if particles remain settled out for
too long, it can be difficult or
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to resuspend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to obstructed hoses or
piping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for liquid active ingredients,
before you add them, you want to check the
[SPEAKER_00]: container of the storage tank to make sure
that mixture is mixed in the container
[SPEAKER_00]: before you even add it to the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this should help keep things evenly
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to give you an agitation
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a professor in plant
pathology and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Dr. David Rosenberger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was using Nordex 75WG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fungicide for select tree and vine
crops and field and veg crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the Nordex label
language, it states agitate the mixture to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a uniform suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David ran into problems trying to
apply this product with poor agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product settled to the bottom of
the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remained as a sludge after the liquid
was sprayed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in David's case, he said,
just reviewing that statement on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label, or even a 10 to 15 minute jar test
would have forewarned him of the settling
[SPEAKER_00]: problems beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about jar tests
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing you want to think about
is the properties of your carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those can greatly influence
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're first going to talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH just measures the degree to which a
substance is acidic or basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon juice, for example, has a pH of
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia has a pH of 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water is supposed to have a pH
that's close to neutral, or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about how this is
not always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most pesticides perform best if your
carrier's pH is four to 6.5 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do better in slightly acidic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One exception would be the sulfonylureal
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perform best at slightly basic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of seven to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your pH is out of range for your
particular pesticide, products can fall
[SPEAKER_00]: out of solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can degrade and decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will happen faster if the pH is
more extreme or the temperature is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also lose their electrical
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can reduce the product
penetration into weeds, so reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, it's really important that
your pH be optimal for pesticides to be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and to ensure they're
compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make sure that the pH is
addressed properly when you're tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I don't want you to get overwhelmed by
this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to realize that the pH of
your water source can be really variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a chart from a study that
was done in 1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's showing this pH for
different water sources in the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: growing regions of New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you have these different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to focus on is really
just that the range is so variable in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these similar regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then across the sea, you can also see
that you see a difference in the pH range
[SPEAKER_00]: from summer to fall to spring in these
same areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so pH can shift both seasonally and
within the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, these shifts,
especially in surface water, can be
[SPEAKER_00]: because of sediments in microorganisms and
minerals that are in flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is just don't assume
that you know the pH, even if you tested
[SPEAKER_00]: it last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be testing your water source
really frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to measure the pH of your
water sources several times throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to test your water probably a
couple of weeks before your spray regime
[SPEAKER_00]: begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll give you time to kind of
evaluate your water, make sure you know
[SPEAKER_00]: which products will be optimal with your
water source, and also which pH adjusters
[SPEAKER_00]: or adjuvants you might want to have on
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to measure pH, you can use an
electronic pH meter or pH die strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those can be found pretty
easily online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, labels may direct you to measure pH
at different times during the mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but you always want to measure pH
after mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to add your pH adjusters
if you need to adjust the pH with care.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, pH adjusters like water conditioners
or adjuvants, they might be inhibited by
[SPEAKER_00]: the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes specific ones are
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that what you add
is effective and compatible with your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acidifiers, they can lower the pH of the
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they can lower it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can cause your active ingredients
to precipitate out a solution or even
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen, I think that you are, I'm just
going to mute Karen here unless you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to keep in mind that the label
may require adding the conditioner first
[SPEAKER_00]: or at some point some other time during
the mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't assume that you always add at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be aware of product
degradation over time as well with
[SPEAKER_00]: different pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so an active ingredient can become
ineffective after 10 hours when the pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: five, but it can only last two minutes at
a pH of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, these are exact numbers I'm giving
you, but it really can be dramatically
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Purdue University's extension
publication that I was looking over shares
[SPEAKER_00]: these following rules of thumb for most
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if your mixture is 3.5 to 6 pH,
you're going to want to apply that mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: within 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH is a little closer to neutral,
you want to apply it within one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your pH is more than seven,
you want to apply that immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, this rule of thumb is only
for most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about how most pesticides do
well, and the pH is a little more acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell phone or your real herbicides
wouldn't match these time frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just gives you an idea that
things can really degrade over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best rule of thumb, of course,
is to just mix right before you apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label will not always mention water
pH, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't mean it won't cause an
incompatibility problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen often is the
manufacturer just might assume that your
[SPEAKER_00]: water pH will be in a normal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may not be able to warn you about
an out-of-range pH issue, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not assuming that you have an out-of-range
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to avoid mixing pesticides
with radically different pH requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what would happen is that you're
always trying to condition for one
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would mean that you're kind of
reducing the efficacy and performance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other, right, if they're radically
different needs for the pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, Li 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help acidify spray water,
so products like Captan and Imidan don't
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's useful for Captan and Imidan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to mix Li 700 with copper
fungicides, for instance, that can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity at low pH, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should just avoid mixing
pesticides that have radically different
[SPEAKER_00]: pH requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we'll talk about water hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another factor that can influence
compatibility is water hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So negatively charged pesticide molecules
have a tendency to attach or attract to
[SPEAKER_00]: positively charged cations that are
naturally found in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these include things like aluminum,
iron, calcium, sodium, and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides that bind with these minerals
can actually precipitate out of solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they might be less likely to enter the
target pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weak acid herbicides like glyphosate or
dotine or 2,4-D and dicamba are more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to incompatibility in hard
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from this map I have in
the US that the natural concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: these minerals in hard water, so water
hardness, red is like the most hard water,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really varies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the hardest water is sort of
in the middle of the country or a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more out west from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also, if you look at New York
state, there's some red parts of our
[SPEAKER_00]: state, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of variation across our
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to be careful that you
know what the water hardness is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a pause here and think about
why would water hardness render pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm showing here is two
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left contains distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has zero water hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one on the right, contains hard
water, a lot of minerals concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a material that mimics glyphosate is
going to be added to both these bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that the water on the
left remains clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicates that the added product
is in solution, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water on the right is cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is indicating is that the
calcium has actually bound to the
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate mimic, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the mixture on the right were to
be applied, there would not be any
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate available.
[SPEAKER_00]: to act on your weeds because it would have
already bound to the hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're adding the full rate to
your tank, you're just not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: any efficacy because it's bound to the
hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you think about this,
this is like on a continuum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a really high
concentration, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this where it's completely
ineffective, but there might be different
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees of efficacy depending on how hard
your water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to avoid water hardness issues,
you'll want to measure water hardness with
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available water testing kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your water is out of the normal
range, water softeners like ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate or AMS and ammonium thiosulfate
can counter the effects of hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to be careful because adding
AMS to things like EC formulations can
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes result in phytotoxicity and
hopefully, you know, it should be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Angenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is an herbicide listed for DT
Soybean in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's instructions to use a
conditioning agent if your water iron
[SPEAKER_00]: content is above 500 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, all right, I'm going to use
this conditioning agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the label dictates not to use the more
common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AMS or UAN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, you have to use conditioners
that are pre-approved for Angenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually have to go look those up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're in a different section
of the label, but this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this label, there's a statement
that talks about noting that the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering agent that's required for this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is another assumption of why
there's so many exceptions and
[SPEAKER_00]: complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example of why you have to
check the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about water
turbidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water hardness is when negatively
charged pesticides were attracted to cat
[SPEAKER_00]: ions and weren't available to act on your
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: With water turbidity, what you have is
positively charged pesticides that are
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to and bind to negatively
charged particles in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the negatively charged
particles that are in your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are things like soil sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, just do not mix pesticides
with water that is visibly muddy or murky,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this will lead to incompatibility
or could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the label will talk about
turbidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't see this as well,
but this is glyphosate plus, and the label
[SPEAKER_00]: states reduced results may occur if water
containing soil is used, such as visibly
[SPEAKER_00]: muddy water or water from ponds and
ditches that is not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, and we're thinking about carrier
properties, let's talk about temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water temperature influences the rate
at which products dissolve, disperse,
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsify and flow, and more materials will
dissolve in warmer water than in colder
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold water is just not moving as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be able to bump into
your pesticides as much to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: them as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they don't dissolve as much
as they do in warm water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have cold water, dry and liquid
flowable formulations will take longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: ECs, crop oil and seed oil formulations
will form gels and kind of distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: unevenly in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water soluble packets may not dissolve
as easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take a really long time to
dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you avoid compatibility issues
with cold water?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with colder water,
you'll want to agitate the water more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to wait for longer for those
products to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you maybe even want to create
pre-slurries in warmer water to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: products are distributing evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put them in warm water first before
you add it to the cold tank water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that temperature is
usually not addressed in the label because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's assumed that you're working with
water that's within the right temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how cold is too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's not enough research
on this for me to really give you an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully more comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can show you is research out of
Purdue which is summarized in this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did in the study is they
mixed the following herbicides here with
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperature water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extras show where the herbicide
performance was reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it wasn't reduced completely,
but it was reduced in some way for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least some weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the checks show where the products
were effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though they only tested four
products, this information could help you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you're seeing is that if the
water is at 72, these herbicides were
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wasn't when the water was as
cold as 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as your water gets farther away
from 72 and closer to 41, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to think about increasing agitation,
waiting longer for products to dissolve,
[SPEAKER_00]: and creating those pre-slurries in warm
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important tools that you
have at your disposal to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility is to test before you mix
in the tank with a small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the jar test, you're probably
familiar with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should always conduct a jar test
if you're mixing products that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: not mixed before because you don't know if
those will be incompatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to experiment with an
untested tank mixing data application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also do periodic jar tests with
products that you actually have mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because manufacturers can often
change the inert ingredients that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes another factor such as your
carrier pH or water hardness could change
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might impact compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar test could actually catch that for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there's no recovery once you've
mixed things in the tank if you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility issues, or often no
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar test can really save you from
losing product and having a mess cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do a jar test, you're looking for
the following indicators of
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about it's really hard to
flag chemical incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You often can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes the mixture will give off
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes you're going to see something
looking cloudy, kind of like that
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate in hard water example that I
showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be able to catch chemical
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly you're going to be able to catch
physical incompatibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see layers forming,
or the mixture is uniform, or particles
[SPEAKER_00]: are floating or foaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to see residue
accumulating on the sides of the container
[SPEAKER_00]: or material that just takes a really long
time just to settle to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or larger particles are present that would
not fit through your screens, filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: or nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you conduct the jar test,
you're going to use the exact same water
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that water pH hardness,
turbidity, can all make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the labels usually tell you how
to do a jar test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it usually involves measuring cups and
glass or plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't reuse those for other purposes,
just for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can purchase chemical
compatibility test kits online if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to with all the supplies needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To conduct the test, you're going to mix
the appropriate amounts of carrier and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make sure you use enough
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would start by adding the carrier
that's needed, about one fifth to one half
[SPEAKER_00]: carrier needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mix in the proportionate
amount of pesticides in the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to add the rest of the
carrier and you invert the container after
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've mixed your products in the
jar, you're going to let it stand for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you can let it stand for longer,
that'll give you more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a pesticide were to degrade overnight,
for instance, if you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar test can go overnight, and maybe
that's how long your mixture is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the tank, that would really let you
know if you're going to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to drive home why you need enough
water, here on the left, we have pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: products Touchdown and Flexstar mixed with
liquid AMS and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, we only have 25 milliliters
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, we have the recommended
80 milliliters of water, just based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you don't use the right
proportion, you can see that the one on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left is much less close to being
compatible than the one on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: when enough water was added.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're getting close to the
end here, but I'm going to throw a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of extra tips at you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to think about compatibility
is really holistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going into each little aspect
of it, but actually it's really important
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at things overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many things to take into
account all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an example here, and it's
Cactan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fungicide label for fruit
ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that the label
warns that mixing Cactan with alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: materials, like spray lime and Bordeaux
mix, can reduce the fungicidal activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because the liquid lime sulfur
has an extremely high pH, so it can
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade Cactan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing you want to
watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the label mentions that you should
not apply Cactan close to oil sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because the oil can
actually make your plant cuticle more
[SPEAKER_00]: permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means that Cactan could enter the
plant and cause phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, the label states that there might be
problems with Cactan and phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problems with Cactan and
phytotoxicity can get worse after an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of cloudy and damp
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to look out for
the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why this is is because new
leaves are going to be growing when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy and damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those new leaves will have less
cuticular waxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be easier for Cactan to accidentally
penetrate and damage the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the label will discourage the use of
spreaders that cause excessive wetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because, much like with the
oils, adding adjuvants that increase
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration into the plant can cause
damage to your plant and phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the label talks about
organophosphates and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, lint, which contains
phosphate in its formulation, when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed around the same time as Cactan,
it can result in phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows how many things you
have to keep in mind when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with many things that are this
complicated, there's always additional
[SPEAKER_00]: rules to thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked to some Cornell Cooperative
Extension educators and scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to share the following
tips with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve, how are we doing on time?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got another 10 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I might go a little bit over the
50 minutes, but we'll still have time for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of the additional rules
of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to share these with you
because I was talking to people that work
[SPEAKER_00]: with fruit and veg growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is really helpful to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I want to talk about is
you want to keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity can be specific to specific
crops and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so read the labels really carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't assume that things will be true
across all cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Apogee, this is a product
that can cause fruit cracking on empire
[SPEAKER_00]: and stamen apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's safe on other cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and even if you aren't tank mixing,
you want to be careful with tank residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, azoxystrobin will cause
leaf and fruit burn on some apple
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, even if it's just in the
slightest amount, like in parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this could be a situation where you
don't clean out your tank as well as you
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to after spraying azoxy on pumpkins
or something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you later spray an apple and there's
only a tiny bit of that azoxystrobin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can damage the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to make sure your
ingredients are fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if you're an apple
grower, you might know that lime absorbs
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide, and the reason why apple
growers might know this is because paper
[SPEAKER_00]: bags of lime were actually traditionally
placed in controlled atmosphere apple
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because they absorb
carbon dioxide and this reduced injury to
[SPEAKER_00]: stored apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now think about other uses you might
have for lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make Bordeaux mix with spray lime
and copper sulfate, imagine what might
[SPEAKER_00]: happen if you're using some of the older
spray lime that you were storing in paper
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't seal that spray lime up,
it probably absorbs some carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like with the glyphosate in
the hard water example that I showed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it will have bound to the carbon
dioxide and that lime will no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: combine with the copper sulfate because
it's just not going to be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the copper is going to be less
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind how fresh your ingredients
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to talk about name
brand versus generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be really careful here and
say this is just anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there's not, you know, proven studies
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from people who have worked closely
with apple and vegetable growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm hearing is that there's reports
of mixing issues and also crop damage with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your cheaper or off brand
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason why is because cheaper
formulations can have varying amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant or varying quality of the inert
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the active ingredient is
the same between the two different
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the one that's off brand,
you know, you might have to add more
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant or there's just less quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, with glyphosate,
for instance, some of those off brand
[SPEAKER_00]: products that have glyphosate as the
active ingredient might require more
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactants and that can increase the
chances of like say uptake and an injury
[SPEAKER_00]: to tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, if you have a
different quality of your inert
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, we're seeing some generic
formulations that sometimes don't mix as
[SPEAKER_00]: well with the name brands, for instance,
Bravo Weather Stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably because those inert
ingredients just not being as quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, be careful which
products you mix with biological products,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, because products like fungicides,
sanitizers or bactericides can kill those
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're dead, they're definitely
not going to be effective against your
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a lot about how to prevent
incompatibility before you even have the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your first line of defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if you do run into unexpected
incompatibility in your tank?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do when you first notice it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to contact your dealer or
product manufacturer to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst case scenario, they can tell you how
to dispose of the solution in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the least risk to you and poses the
least risk to the environment and your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also might direct you to add a
conditioner or an adjuvant that could
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be things like more water,
a compatibility agent, a detergent,
[SPEAKER_00]: soap, non-ionic surfactant or a pH
adjuster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if that added product resolves
the incompatibility, it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: your product will be effective anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll want to check with the dealer or
manufacturer to know if your product will
[SPEAKER_00]: still work or if you just resolve the
incompatibility enough to not damage your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also want to check,
is the problem isolated to your spray
[SPEAKER_00]: tank?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you may need to dismantle your
sprayer to remove any residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's all that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am ready to take questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary, I will just say to you, thank you so
much for making a very complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: subject, I think, rather easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't bore you all to tears.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's such an important subject,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was really fascinating,
too, in terms of the order to put things
[SPEAKER_02]: in and how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
