[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I want to do is to
thank all of you for coming this
[SPEAKER_03]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the next, I would say, a little
over than half an hour or 40 minutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to talk a little bit about
Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure most of you are
familiar with Mycorrhizae, and I see some
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar faces here who work with
Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to approach this area from a
commercial standpoint a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would have an idea of, you know,
at Mycorrhizal Applications, how we handle
[SPEAKER_03]: this topic and what kind of research we do
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as an introduction, Mycorrhizal
fungi form symbiosis with plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: and most of the plants have this ability
to form symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 90% of the land plants reported to
form symbiosis, and they live in the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they interact with the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't go to the leaves and any
other parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mycorrhizae provides a better absorption
of nutrients and increase the water uptake
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the benefit for the plant from
the Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, this is not free, so the fungus
requires from the plant to provide carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: in return.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some kind of a realistic
relationship, a symbiosis between the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and the fungus where both of the
participants have benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cannot function without living
plants, and this is very important from
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial standpoint when you apply like
Mycorrhizal inoculum, and there's no plant
[SPEAKER_03]: in the soil, you don't really see the
benefits of Mycorrhizae because there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to interact with the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only the plants control this
symbiosis, so when the plants are under
[SPEAKER_03]: stressful conditions like drought stress
or nutrient stress, they produce root
[SPEAKER_03]: exudates that triggers Mycorrhizal spores
to germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is how the symbiosis starts to
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: They increase the nutrient and the water
absorption for the plants by increasing
[SPEAKER_03]: the absorption zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not just increasing the root
biomass, but also form a mycelium around
[SPEAKER_03]: the root zone that actually expands or
extends this absorption area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to have a couple of slides
about this, you know, what the details are
[SPEAKER_03]: of this aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they increase the tolerance to various
stressors like drought stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: salt stress, salinity stress, heavy metal
toxicity, and I'm going to talk a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit about this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are different types of
Mycorrhizae that exist, and so the most
[SPEAKER_03]: important ones are endomycorrhizae or
barbuscular mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got their name after their
relationship, structural relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant, so actually they penetrate
inside the cortical cells of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they are called
endomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: because they go inside the cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are called arbuscular mycorrhizae as
well, and most of the agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: horticultural plants belong to this
category or form symbiosis with this type
[SPEAKER_03]: of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another type of mycorrhizae called
ectomycorrhizae that actually do not
[SPEAKER_03]: penetrate inside the cortical cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: They form a mantle around the roots and
they form the symbiosis or they form their
[SPEAKER_03]: hyphae in the intercellular spaces of the
roots, and they are ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They live in symbiosis with hardwoods,
forest trees, pines, spruces, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very specific kind, actually a
subtype of ectomycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_03]: ectendomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They represent only a very tiny portion of
the of the plants and the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orchids have a specific type of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called orchid mycorrhizae,
so they do not form symbiosis with
[SPEAKER_03]: ectomycorrhizae, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aricaceous plants like blueberries,
azalea, or rhododendron, they form
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiosis with aricaceous mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very specific type of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are very, very tiny portions,
like only one genus or one plant species,
[SPEAKER_03]: that form symbiosis with arbutus plants or
monotropa, the ghost plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They represent only a very tiny portion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are just to mention, but the main
types are endomycorrhizae and
[SPEAKER_03]: ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to talk a little bit about
these today, focusing on endomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we talk about endomycorrhizae,
we know that they form symbiosis with a
[SPEAKER_03]: large number of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 80% of the plants form symbiosis with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I mentioned, they colonize the
plants inside the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not that easy to recognize
just by looking at the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: if the plant is colonized or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we have to do is we have to
collect the roots, clear them,
[SPEAKER_03]: stain them, and evaluate them under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is just an example how a
prepared root sample looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we clear the roots and stain them,
this is what we see, that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: practically nothing really, nothing
interesting in the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when we look at a root with
mycorrhizae, what you can see that you see
[SPEAKER_03]: different structures inside the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are spores and vesicles that are
storage organs.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the mycorrhizae and also mycelium
inside the roots and arbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are tiny, like tree-like
structures that are actually responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for the exchange of nutrients between the
fungus and the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, basically this is how we
evaluate different plants to detect the
[SPEAKER_03]: presence of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another kind of mycorrhizae,
ectomycorrhizae, that forms symbiosis with
[SPEAKER_03]: less than 10% of plant species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the major host plants are coniferous
or deciduous trees, spruces, pine trees
[SPEAKER_03]: that form symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are actually mushrooms that form
fruiting bodies in the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you walk in the forest and you see
different trees, you see that
[SPEAKER_03]: ectomycorrhizae or mushrooms form on the
surface of the ground and they are every
[SPEAKER_03]: time interconnected with the plants around
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a very interesting phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we compare the ectomycorrhizae
and endomycorrhizae in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: appearance, you can actually see the
difference in root morphology,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the roots normally look a bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a very nice example,
the fly agaric for ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at the roots,
these are colonized by ectomycorrhizae and
[SPEAKER_03]: Fisolithus tincturius in this case,
and this is non-colonized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually really visible in case of
ectomycorrhizae, how larger the root could
[SPEAKER_03]: be or how their morphology could change
just by the colonization of this fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this really helps in increasing the
absorption area of the roots and taking up
[SPEAKER_03]: more nutrients and water from the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take a look at the roots,
and this is particularly true for
[SPEAKER_03]: endomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the roots and these are the
fungal mycelium or hyphae around the roots
[SPEAKER_03]: and some spores, what you can see as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mycorrhizae form the symbiosis and
they live inside the roots and also
[SPEAKER_03]: outside the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some species can form spores outside the
roots and some species inside the roots,
[SPEAKER_03]: and most of them actually do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we talk about mycorrhizae from
commercial standpoint, growers always ask
[SPEAKER_03]: why plants need mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have roots and couldn't just take
up nutrients and water efficiently without
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we try to explain the difference,
the structural and functional benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: what mycorrhizae can provide when we
compare the root hair and the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we look at the roots, this is a
plant root here and this is the root hair
[SPEAKER_03]: that actually is responsible for taking up
most of the nutrients and the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the maximum length of the root hair is
only a few millimeters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a very tiny area or soil volume
that they can explore to take up the
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cation absorption occurs only at
the roots root tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the absorption is only at the root
tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a very tiny area for nutrient
and water uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another important thing that we have
to consider is that the nutrient uptake is
[SPEAKER_03]: normally from the available or easily
soluble pool of the soil and of the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to talk a little bit about
it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of this tiny absorption area
at the root tips, the nutrient inflow into
[SPEAKER_03]: the roots is normally slower, much slower
than the mycorrhizal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we look at the mycorrhizal
hyphae or that network of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: hyphae in the roots, we see a huge
difference from plant roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what you can see here is this is a
root, a feeder root that is responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this network of mycelium around it are
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you have to see here is that
maximum length could be up to two feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what happens is they can
extend this depletion zone, we call it
[SPEAKER_03]: depletion zone, where the nutrients and
the water uptake occurs by two feet,
[SPEAKER_03]: which could be extremely important under
drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nutrient and the water absorption
occurs along the entire length of the
[SPEAKER_03]: hyphae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just the tips, but the entire
length could take up nutrients and water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a huge increase in absorption
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mineral nutrient uptake from the soluble
and insoluble pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just have to mention that they
produce enzymes like phosphatases that
[SPEAKER_03]: helps solubilizing phosphate and easier to
take up for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also they take up nutrients and
transport it to the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of this increased absorption
area or absorptive area, the nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: inflow into the hyphae and from the hyphae
to the plant is much faster, much quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to the root uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why, and this is how
mycorrhizae increases the nutrient and the
[SPEAKER_03]: water uptake of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And under field conditions when we look at
mycorrhizae and how it works, and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was just talking about,
that there's a root zone where it's soil
[SPEAKER_03]: volume where the majority of the roots are
located and take up the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the water and what mycorrhizae does,
it extends the soil volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how they can provide benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very important for those
nutrients that have relatively low
[SPEAKER_03]: mobility like phosphorus primarily and
some of the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they cannot just move easily into
that depletion zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's very important and this is very
helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, this is for field
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when there's a possibility for the
roots or the mycorrhizae to explore a
[SPEAKER_03]: larger soil volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are certain conditions when
there's just no, it's not an option to
[SPEAKER_03]: explore a larger soil volume because
there's just no more soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is particularly true for potting
conditions when the plants are grown in a
[SPEAKER_03]: pot and they form these roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are root-bound situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mycorrhizae still provides the benefits
even though there's no larger soil volume
[SPEAKER_03]: to explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they produce enzymes that convert
nutrients into bioavailable forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just mentioned the phosphatases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also trigger the production of
solubilizing enzymes by the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they increase this activity through the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also work together with other
soil microorganisms to convert insoluble
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals into soluble forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are called mycorrhizal helper
bacteria, for example, that live together
[SPEAKER_03]: in symbiosis with the mycorrhizae and help
solubilizing non-soluble nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And due to these mechanisms, they reduce
nutrient leaching out of the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's an excellent study that
actually looked at the effect of
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal fungal application in potting
soil conditions when they grew ornamental
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they looked at nitrogen or nitrate and
orthophosphate leaching out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a busy slide with three
graphs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I just want to point out here that
these graphs show different fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So osmocote is a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a slow-release fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then half-rate and full-rate of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you can see here is that the white
diamonds on the top in all graphs show
[SPEAKER_03]: that when mycorrhizae was not applied,
that's the untreated control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the black diamonds or black squares
show the mycorrhizae application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can compare the amount of nitrate
leached out of the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this shows that just by the application
of mycorrhizal fungi reduced practically
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaching of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the loss of nitrogen in these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is very important that mycorrhizae
helps a better absorption of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants can utilize these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a similar trend with part of
orthophosphate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a phosphorus source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing, without mycorrhizae,
the phosphorus, the amount of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_03]: that leached out of the pots was,
I would say, about twice as much as with
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that is very
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just in pot conditions,
but also in sites where leaching of
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients into the soil or the water is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked a little bit about plants
that form symbiosis with mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there are some plants that do not form
this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't have the ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And prime examples are the Brassicaeaceae
family plants like cabbage, broccoli,
[SPEAKER_03]: kale, cauliflower, mustard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are very good examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just do not form this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are different hypotheses why
they do not form this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most probable reason is that they lost
through the evolution their ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: form this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beets, also a good example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spinach as well, from ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carnation is also a good example for the
plants that do not form this type of
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pigweed, some weeds as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find examples from every areas
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the most important ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we try to explain why mycorrhizal
inoculum and mycorrhizal inoculation is
[SPEAKER_03]: important and how we do it in commercial
situations, we normally talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculant technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I summarized the basics here on this
slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we talk about inoculation,
what we do is we provide a direct contact
[SPEAKER_03]: of the roots with the mycorrhizal fungal
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it propagules because these are
structures that could be used to propagate
[SPEAKER_03]: or re-inoculate the plants with
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are spores and colonized roots
fragments that we normally refer to in
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to have a slide on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very important to have a close or
direct contact of the inoculum with the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots because the root exudates trigger
the mycorrhizal spores to germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mycorrhizal colonization lasts,
in most cases, for the life of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in perennial crops, this means that you
have to inoculate only once in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this inoculation could take place at
any time, the best when there's active
[SPEAKER_03]: root growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with annual plants, you have to
re-inoculate the plants, or not
[SPEAKER_03]: re-inoculate, just do the inoculation
every time when you seed or when there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: new crop coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most economic benefits and best
physiological responses can be achieved by
[SPEAKER_03]: early application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that the earlier you apply the
mycorrhizae, the most benefits you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get out because there's going to
be a longer period of time for the
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae to provide the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, in commercial conditions,
what happens is we have a recommended
[SPEAKER_03]: rate, like X number of propagules,
to apply per plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the plants are smaller,
you have a smaller root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get away with smaller amounts
of mycorrhizal inoculum to get the same
[SPEAKER_03]: colonization or the same inoculum
benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not just cheaper, but it's
better from a physiological standpoint as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We normally say that it requires one
month, three, four weeks for the symbiosis
[SPEAKER_03]: to establish well-established on the
roots, and two months, seven or eight
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks to see the benefits from
inoculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we are talking about these
timeframes, we have to consider from
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial standpoint that when we try to
apply mycorrhizae in a crop that is only
[SPEAKER_03]: like a very short cycle, like three or
four weeks, we might not be able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: the benefits because there's just not
enough time for the mycorrhizae to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: this extra benefit to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good thing is you cannot overdose
with mycorrhizal fungi because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to sit in the soil and eaten by
some animals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the plants don't need the
symbiosis, they just won't germinate in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four main benefits that we
normally mention when we talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal inoculants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one is increased root growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they extend the absorption area by this
formation of mycelium, but also at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time, they help in increasing the
root biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is particularly important in
those crops where the root is the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, in potato, onion,
and carrot, we see great benefits of using
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae to increase the root biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Increased nutrient and water uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is through the increased
absorption area and also increasing the
[SPEAKER_03]: bioavailability of nutrients and allowing
for reduced irrigation and better
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are several papers out there that
shows the benefits of applying mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_03]: with reduced rates of fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a company, we are not really
allowed to say that you can reduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer because if you promote,
let's say, a mycorrhizal inoculant,
[SPEAKER_03]: then other companies will not get any
benefits by selling fertilizer products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be very careful how we word
these claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we can say is that they can
increase or improve the nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: absorption efficiency of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Increased stress tolerance under drought,
heat, and toxic levels of minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a very interesting phenomenon
how mycorrhizae can help in alleviating
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic levels of minerals because what
happens is the mycorrhizal fungi take up
[SPEAKER_03]: the toxic nutrients from the soil,
but they just don't transport it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is how they actually protect the
plant because what happens is if the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: senses that there is no benefit of this
symbiosis or this relationship,
[SPEAKER_03]: then they just try to shut down this
mechanism or this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the fungus won't really
transport these toxic levels of minerals
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, the plant would shut down the
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And reduced transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So transplanting is the most stressful
condition or phase in a plant's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the application of mycorrhizae really
helps under these stressful conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I mentioned here, best if
inoculated before transplanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember, it takes like three,
four weeks for the symbiosis to form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we apply the mycorrhizae at a
seeding stage, so by the time the
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanting happens, the mycorrhizae is
there and can provide the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other documented benefits that I
just want to briefly mention here is
[SPEAKER_03]: increased tolerance to pests and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a resistance called systemic
resistance called mycorrhizae induced
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several publications out there
that shows that, for example, chewing
[SPEAKER_03]: insects are one of their targets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when mycorrhizae colonizes the plants,
the plants become more resistant to these
[SPEAKER_03]: insects, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is not something that you can
find on a product label for mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: products because this would require
registration as a pesticide product,
[SPEAKER_03]: which mycorrhizae is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are also more effective,
more efficient solutions out there like
[SPEAKER_03]: different pesticides or insecticides that
can take care of the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just mentioned here that this is
something that you can consider as a
[SPEAKER_03]: positive, let's say, side benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mycorrhizae is not really applied to
solve these problems or to control
[SPEAKER_03]: insects, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another very important aspect is seed
production and offspring fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been noted that when there's a plant
that is colonized by mycorrhizae and is
[SPEAKER_03]: producing seeds, the seeds from these
mother plants are going to have a better
[SPEAKER_03]: fertility and a better germination rate
compared to those that came from mother
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that were not colonized by
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has something to do with the
increased nutrient and phosphorus content
[SPEAKER_03]: of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just something that is very
interesting to mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also increased secondary metabolite
production in some plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They positively affect active ingredient
production of medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several studies showing that
terpenes, phenols, and alkaloids are
[SPEAKER_03]: increased after the application of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, increased soil
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the production of globulin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a compound that increased the
aggregation of soil particles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is very important to maintain and
improve the soil health by mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is mycorrhizal inoculation
beneficial?
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally under certain, under natural
conditions, mycorrhizae is always in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a wide range of species there
and they provide benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are growing conditions that are
harmful to mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, fumigation,
over-fertilization with nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorus are especially detrimental to
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tillage following and stressful
environments, particularly roadside when
[SPEAKER_03]: they put a lot of salt out around the
roads in the winter just to melt the ice,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is very harmful to mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly artificial growing media,
they just by nature don't contain any
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae and mycorrhizae can be applied
under these conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once they deplete it in the soil,
it just takes time for the natural
[SPEAKER_03]: population to build up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's important to apply
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are just a few photos to
illustrate where mycorrhizae could be
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in fumigation, fumigated soils,
fumigation kills most of the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over-fertilization is not positive,
particularly nitrogen and phosphorus for
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bare root trees or transplants are
particularly good subjects for the use of
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And artificial growing media, it's
something where there's mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally it's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specificity of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a great deal of variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we know that one species of
mycorrhizae can form the symbiosis with
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple species of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, one plant root could
form symbiosis with different species of
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just a great deal of
variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are different species that are
responsible for different functional
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one species is better for phosphorus
uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, other species of mycorrhizae is
better to increase heavy metal toxicity or
[SPEAKER_03]: to increase the tolerance to heavy metal
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are differences in terms of
species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fungal species change with plant
phenology and plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the composition or the chemical
composition of the root exudates change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, and even within the season,
and also the environment of conditions
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the community composition changes
during the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a slide about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the diversity of mycorrhizal
inoculants or microbial inoculants is
[SPEAKER_03]: important to provide a range of species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so under different conditions,
different species can provide the
[SPEAKER_03]: different benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a quick review of one of
the products, actually, that mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: application sells.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a micro-ply that contains four
different species, where we compiled or
[SPEAKER_03]: reviewed the literature and 600 papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just collected or listed those that
what species is responsible for,
[SPEAKER_03]: what functional benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that different species
provide different benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for example, in the case of glomus
massier in nutrient uptake, enzyme
[SPEAKER_03]: activity increases excess micronutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 11 papers showing the benefits for
glomus massier and some interadices and
[SPEAKER_03]: glomus intranicatum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just important and interesting
to see that different species provide
[SPEAKER_03]: different functional benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just one slide, one graph from
a paper, where they evaluated two natural
[SPEAKER_03]: habitats of two species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see two bars here and the
community composition over time from July
[SPEAKER_03]: to the following June.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can see here is the different
colors show different genotype or we can
[SPEAKER_03]: call it different species of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that the colors change
within the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's important that there is a change
in diversity of mycorrhizal species with
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the winter and in the summer,
there are different composition of this
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just one photo where there's a
comparison with a single species and the
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple species.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the difference in growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a grass, in case of a grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inoculum in mycorrhizal products,
so we call them propagules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two main types of
propagules, colonized root fragments that
[SPEAKER_03]: contain spores and high T.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other mycorrhizal structures,
and they normally faster in establishing
[SPEAKER_03]: the relationship, colonize the plant
roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So spores are normally in the dormant
stage and germinate a little bit slower
[SPEAKER_03]: than these root fragments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the two main types of
propagules in commercial products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, a couple slides on
the ways of application, how mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculum could be applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in horticulture, they could be applied
by just spreading or in the planting hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a very efficient way of
inoculating the plants because it provides
[SPEAKER_03]: a direct contact with the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the plants are planted in this
hole, they are gonna be in direct contact
[SPEAKER_03]: with the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be incorporated in the growing
media before or at planting and mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: granular or powder products could come
into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the most important thing is that you
have to provide a very good blending or
[SPEAKER_03]: mixing with the growth medium because what
happens is these tiny cells where the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants or the seeds are gonna be seeded,
they are gonna contain only two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: propagules on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really, really hard to achieve
under commercial conditions to have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: uniform blending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Root dipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is particularly with perennial crops
like grapes or apple trees, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: before planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So growers can just mix up a bucket of
water with some mycorrhizal inoculum and
[SPEAKER_03]: dip the plants into this solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how they provide the direct
contact before planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that you have to be
aware is that the propagules tends to
[SPEAKER_03]: settle in the bottom of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have to shake it or mix it
with the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing could be done by a
backpack sprayer just spraying directly on
[SPEAKER_03]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mycorrhizal inoculum could be applied
through irrigation, could be overhead or
[SPEAKER_03]: drip irrigation, depends on the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best is to water before
application to wet the soil profile and
[SPEAKER_03]: the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: These mycorrhizal propagules are normally
pretty small, less than 300, sometimes 200
[SPEAKER_03]: microns.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they easily travel through the wet soil
profile so they can get into the root
[SPEAKER_03]: zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some products already contain mycorrhizae
on their seed coat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right after germination in the soil,
the mycorrhizae is there, the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus is there to form the symbiosis with
these germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And powder products can be very popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in some cases when, like alfalfa,
they mix the seeds with granular products
[SPEAKER_03]: because the size of the seed is the same
as the granular size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can just spread or sprinkle
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what I had for today.
Okay.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we see the most benefits,
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the conditions are optimal,
let's say an optimum irrigation or
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilization, the plants won't really
need too much help to absorb more
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients or water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see most benefits.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are different formulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that contains four, five,
nine species.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph, can you ask Geneva if they have
any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Geneva campus, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're dealing with an apple tree
coming bare root from a nursery man,
[SPEAKER_04]: is it quite good to just have the nursery
man inoculate the roots or is it much
[SPEAKER_04]: better to wait until they are just going
into the ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: As early as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they can apply it at the nursery,
that's gonna be a much better solution
[SPEAKER_03]: because by the time it is transplanted
into the field, they can provide the
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits and the symbiosis has been
already formed by the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick question about brassicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also heard that there's, you know,
scarcity of symbiotic relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you aware of any studies where they've
tested older germplasm or even sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wild progenitors for symbiotic
relationships?
[SPEAKER_03]: In what plant species?
[SPEAKER_03]: Brassica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, brassica.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I am not aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I recall reading a paper about a
brassica that they found a very mild
[SPEAKER_03]: colonization at their later stage of their
life just before senescence, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: very interesting, but I don't really
remember any germplasm tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When were mycorrhizae first identified and
when was their mechanism first explained?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it was the late 1800s when
they named mycorrhizae and in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say in the 30s or 40s,
1900s, 1930s or 40s when they started to
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize because earlier they thought
that they actually have a negative effect
[SPEAKER_03]: on the plants and they didn't really look
at growth response and what happened is,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, they certainly didn't look at
nutrient uptake and nutrient content of
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaves, but in the 40s when they
started to recognize the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious about the shelf life of these
organisms in packaged potting mix because
some of the artificial mix formulas or
regulators are incorporating various kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of mycorrhizae and how long would those
mycorrhizae stay active in a prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: potting mix before any plant gets put into
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, dry and granular formulations have a
two year shelf life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is required from state regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when it's mixed in with the soil,
everything depends on the moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's a low moisture content,
it's gonna have a longer shelf life,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say one year or up to two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if it has a high moisture
content, over 40% that could reduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf life significantly to even six
months or one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on the components.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the storage conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious what you see as the biggest
challenge for the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the mycorrhizal inoculant industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is probably the high number
of companies that are popping up right now
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's really easy so I didn't talk
about the production of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's in vitro and in vivo
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: In vitro happens in the lab, in vivo is
out the field and in vivo production is
[SPEAKER_03]: really relatively easy to do and smaller
companies tend to start because it's start
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow mycorrhizae on their own and
without any quality control, any field
[SPEAKER_03]: trial testing, they market their product
and they put everything on the label that
[SPEAKER_03]: has been published for different species
of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens is that reduces the
credibility of the larger producers
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's just really hard to control
and I see that's the most important
[SPEAKER_03]: problem to stay credible and just put
those claims on the label that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: been tested because most of the companies
don't really have a budget to execute a
[SPEAKER_03]: large scale field trial program to test it
in corn, to test it in various species and
[SPEAKER_03]: that creates some kind of attention
because there are hundreds of products out
[SPEAKER_03]: there but growers just don't know which
one to choose because the information is
[SPEAKER_03]: just not out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see that's a main issue right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of following up on the mycorrhizae
added to growing mixes or these garden
[SPEAKER_02]: center bags of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know that it'll work for what
you want to be growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it wasted on maybe these species
don't work for tomatoes or trees?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, actually that's another main problem
that I have to mention because some
[SPEAKER_03]: companies just put a lot of things in
potting mixes, for example, both
[SPEAKER_03]: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae and
certainly the potting mix that is labeled
[SPEAKER_03]: for vegetable use, there's ectomycorrhizae
and if you just pay for ectomycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's never gonna do anything or any harm,
any good and that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that there are several products out
there that are marketed for specific uses
[SPEAKER_03]: but not the right components are there,
not the right species.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there are products out there
for ericaceous, particularly ericaceous
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, blueberries and there's just
ectomycorrhizae in it and it just won't
[SPEAKER_03]: help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you find out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's best to call the
manufacturer and get the information
[SPEAKER_03]: directly from them because if there's a
credible company, so they should have a
[SPEAKER_03]: technical support department where they
can provide all this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can certainly look it up online on
the internet and find papers but the
[SPEAKER_03]: easiest is just to talk to them directly
and get the information firsthand from
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've run out of time but I do want to
again remind graduate students if you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to continue the dialogue with Dr.
Rapsko, we will be in room 22 plant
[SPEAKER_01]: science starting in 10 minutes or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
