[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michael Gore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you from this section of
plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question of the day, well,
perhaps this isn't a question of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, but it's a question of the day
for me that I will pose to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that how did Mike Gore get into
hydroprotophenotyping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back to my days of being a
graduate student in Edward Buckler's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this population of 5,000 very
common and inbred lines called the
[SPEAKER_00]: maize-nam population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took an army of people to plant and
an army of people to phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after all those countless days of
having to do plant height, year height,
[SPEAKER_00]: or flowering time out in the field,
I began thinking of ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroprotophenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that we had thought about
doing hydroprotophenotyping was perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: having a plane fly over the field,
which we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way, was having a large helium
balloon tied to a four-wheeler and pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: through the field, and a nice expensive
camera attached as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began doing that and driving back and
forth through the field, but sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind would pick up and there would be some
tension on that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little scary, but we were all
pretty sure that that line was strong
[SPEAKER_00]: until one day it snapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember our feeling when our field
manager, Nick, calling the police and
[SPEAKER_00]: asking them if they would shoot the
balloon out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so thankful for humanity that they did
not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all we know, that camera is in
Canada somewhere and it's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thankfully, I didn't allow my
hydroprotophenotyping dreams to float away
[SPEAKER_00]: that fateful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2009, I accepted a position to work
in the USDA in Maricopa, Arizona,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a great decision on my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment was very harsh for human
and for growing plant, but I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: viewed it as a test track for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great environment for testing
for heat and drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hired to work on cotton,
so coming from the maze, community,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at that time working on the first
generation haplotype map and maze,
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing I was going to have to dedicate
my life to working out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the only people I would make proud
would probably be Mark Sorrels,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would actually go out to the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I didn't realize at the time when I
had my interview there in January is it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when my family and I moved back out,
in June there were so many four-letter
[SPEAKER_00]: words dropped that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We adapt just like the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the challenges, such as when
you think about cotton trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably produce it, in the face of
global climate change, the patterns of
[SPEAKER_00]: weather are highly variable right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our fresh water resources,
especially when I was living in Arizona,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were drawing down the Colorado
River, when you actually see it firsthand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is quite traumatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here when we're looking at the cotton
belt right here of the U.S., and this was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken in 2011 here, this is where there
was a co-occurrence of a severe drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to have an idea of the economic
impact of what a drought can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: this caused two billion of economic loss
in cotton production.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is some of the consequences of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it on the news, but really it's
impacting human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was hired, this is kind of
the charge that I felt burdened with,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I felt I had to carry, is how are we
going to turn that engine of evolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant populations fast enough to generate
these resilient cultivars to help provide
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber to the world, but also provide a
source of financial income to the farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this one in Garfield County,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2009, we began thinking a lot about
genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, we could also
think of recombination and CRISPR-Cas9
[SPEAKER_00]: tying into a genomic framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole idea is how many more
generations can you turn per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ideally, this would result in
faster development of more resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, and in this case, cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, we have our training
population, and we do genotyping and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping on that training population to
train our GS model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But phenotyping is still very important,
because when you think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction accuracies, highly heritable
phenotypes and high-quality phenotypes is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's driving a lot of that GS model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's obviously a lot of
improvements that can be made to these GS
[SPEAKER_00]: models, where, you know, you're training
on a phenotypic and phenotypic dataset,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're trying to predict the
phenotype of a related population that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been only genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phenotype is what I decided to focus
on at that time, back in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: But coming into it, we all knew that the
classic phenotyping, as I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, plant breeders know how to do
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant breeders are very industrious in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just hire an army, and that's how
they get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're working in an environment
such as Arizona, which has sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
you need to work a lot more intelligently,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you won't last very long in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that time-intensive component
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, if you're doing plant physiological
traits, the sample sizes are fairly small,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can only do perhaps like a few
time points as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, from a plant breeding,
there's obviously trait bias, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to only phenotype what you can
visually score, or perhaps you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: driving a combine at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to hiring a large field
crew, that is also very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my colleague here, Mike
Salvucci, and he introduced me to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycorz 6400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all enamored with it at first,
until I realized how much of a pain it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having to work in that intense heat,
and to realize you would sit maybe for a
[SPEAKER_00]: half an hour in front of a couple plants,
and you wouldn't really get that much
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypic data that we were
able to get would be like transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, and can it to be temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had a FLIR camera that we
could shoot in front of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this is pictured in Pima cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not know what Pima cotton is,
it has nice, long fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like that high thread count
sheets that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, we were really thinking
about, how do we do this a lot faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't that we're lazy, we just want to
have very large populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be able to really cover all
the different developmental time points of
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant as they're growing over the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be as objective as we can
possibly be, and we want to do this at low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an agricultural engineer that
I began talking to in 2009, Pedro Andrade
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanchez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a sense, we found this tractor in
the junkyard, and it needed a new engine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new tires and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing, I think at this time,
version two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Version one tractor, high clearance
tractor, we just pulled out of a junkyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and put in a new motor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some new tires on, put this toolbar
on, and we're set to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of sensor fusion is,
in a sense, combining all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: data streams to be able to use them and
get as much information out of in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand what is the crop
doing over these various time points of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're imposing, in this case,
heat and drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the phenotypes that we were
focusing on first was a vegetation index,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's focused up in here,
and these are called crop circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had IRTs on the tractor as well,
and they are pointing down over the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to do phenotyping of canopy
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the ultrasonic
transducers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pointed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we were able to do,
canopy height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had RTK GPS on the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we're able to re-resolve
and deconvolute all these phenotypic data
[SPEAKER_00]: points down to individual plants in a
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to do that entirely and
repeatedly over the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that you do,
kind of as a plant breeder, is think
[SPEAKER_00]: about, okay, we're able to collect all
this, perhaps, gigabytes to terabytes of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic data, but is it of value?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it heritable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it repeatable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things that I
basically wanted to do is here we were
[SPEAKER_00]: testing this on 25 Pima cultivars,
and here we have on the Y-axis canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and on the X-axis
leaf-relative water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is basically showing is this
canopy temperature is checking with
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in the soil-plant-water
relationship, whereas the dry plots have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher canopy temperature because the
transpiration rate is reduced of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because they're trying to conserve
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the transpiration rate is shut down,
and in turn, the canopy temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the blue, these would be,
and you can kind of view them as control
[SPEAKER_00]: plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the well-watered wet plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transpiration rate is high because
these plants aren't shutting down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're able to continue to cool the
crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had heard from Todd about this
vegetation index called NDVI, which ties
[SPEAKER_00]: in red and near-infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is really typically doing
is, in a sense, quantifying biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also tying in leaf area index,
chlorophyll content, and coverage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plant canopy itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we saw here over time of these 25
Pima cultivars is the plots that are
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from NDVI, they begin to decrease
their NDVI value over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this response was actually
capturing is the degree to which the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants wilt, because here you see a Pima
cultivar that's under intense drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see the leaves wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a vegetation index that is,
in a sense, capturing greenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the leaves droop, there's more soil
exposed up through the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also as the leaves wilt, they're
changing their conformation as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's changing the pattern of leaf
reflection as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why those values are
decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of a fun way to see if
you can plot this over time within the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual day is capturing biomass,
but in our eyes now, we're able to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the degree to which the plants
actually wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to also see that this
system was repeatable over the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season, assuming that the canopy was
closed and that the drip irrigation was
[SPEAKER_00]: not clogged, because there are challenges
when you're growing on drip irrigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: it isn't cleared out right, you need to
pump some sulfuric acid through there and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up just right, and things begin
flowing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we saw is, when we were doing this
high throughput phenotyping with the
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor, we could easily see parts of the
field from the response of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: where the drip tape was actually clogged,
because those were the plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: heating up very fast, and then you would
just pump in the sulfuric acid and clear
[SPEAKER_00]: it out, and it cleaned it up just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have the same high
clearance tractor system, and here I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: calling field-based high throughput plant
phenotyping system, and it's QTL mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: of different traits over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't thought about QTL in
this sense, you can just think of a QTL as
[SPEAKER_00]: a quantitative trait locus, but in a
sense, it's just a chromosomal region
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling phenotypic variants in that
part of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we have this recombinant
inbred line population of close to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinant inbred lines, and these
recombinant inbred lines are a mosaic of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, you shuffle up the genome,
and then you're using the patterns of
[SPEAKER_00]: recombination to track these regions of
the genome with the phenotypic variation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if those particular regions of the
genome are showing up, that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to as a QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we also have our field-based high
throughput phenotyping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did these various agronomic traits,
such as lint yield, bowl size,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fiber quality, and thanks to Tim Seder
at the time, we were also able to
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype a size-like acid concentration
as a physiological leaf trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was saying, this was all grown in
drip irrigation, and we had soil neutron
[SPEAKER_00]: probes in the field, which if you've ever
put these in, you can feel our pain
[SPEAKER_00]: because we would have to do these readings
every week before and after turning on the
[SPEAKER_00]: drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing about having drip
irrigation, you can have a set time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in a sense, the plants are only almost
trained very well when you're turning on
[SPEAKER_00]: and off the drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a shot of the actual field
right here in Maricopa, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, what this is is basically
recapitulating a canopy temperature heat
[SPEAKER_00]: map of the field, and each of these little
circles or pixels right here are an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic data point that was taken by
the high-clearance tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you recall, we have these four
IRTs on the tractor, so we're able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping of four rows at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cooler the canopy is, the bluer it
is, and you see these little areas right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, those are our alleys in the field
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a control treatment right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here would be the dry drought treatment
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you can see the canopy
temperature is heating up, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: this part of the field right here is
actually cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we ran an EM38 and checked out
the conductivity of the soil, what we had
[SPEAKER_00]: found out, this part of the field had a
higher clay content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do any drought testing in
the field, the thing you should always
[SPEAKER_00]: understand is there's more variation for
the soil than there are actual traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're phenotyping in your plant
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to control for this type of
field variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your models, or you'll just end up
being a breeder breeding for soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't be the first one that
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing here is that canopy
temperature turned out to be highly
[SPEAKER_00]: heritable in this recombinant inbred line
population, and in this case shows
[SPEAKER_00]: transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that transgressive variation
actually means is you have progenies that
[SPEAKER_00]: exceeds the phenotypic values of the
actual parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the two parents here,
NM24S16 and TM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the control plots here,
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the dry plots here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the control plots here,
wet, had a heritability brought since of
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.83.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is heritability of 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: These heritability values generally range
between zero and one, and they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be quite high here because one thing to
keep in mind, we were doing phenotyping at
[SPEAKER_00]: three time points within a single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really taking in all of that
variance within the actual day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's helping to increase the
heritability of the phenotype itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we have the tractor,
we can do phenotyping over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't thought about cotton
growing, so here we go from seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps eighth node, four to five weeks
after first bloom, and then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a defoliant to force all of the leaves
to fall off because cotton is a perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: tree that's treated as an annual crop,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing is, you know,
here's when the trials are planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have equal irrigation applied to both
the wet and dry treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the phenotypes that we had
targeted at four different time points,
[SPEAKER_00]: so canopy temperature, canopy NDV,
which just to remind you is a vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: index, and then canopy height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began opposing the
differential irrigation at flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: because we didn't want confounding because
that's why we didn't do it early on prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because also, as a few of you probably
know, often when people are breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerance, it's actually drought
escape, and the QTL tend to be just genes
[SPEAKER_00]: for flowering time, and that's one thing
that we wanted to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of season,
we're driving like a cotton picker through
[SPEAKER_00]: the field and harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here what we have is canopy
temperature over the whole growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we were able to break up these
basically days of the year into the
[SPEAKER_00]: different developmental growth phases of
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have flowering at peak bloom,
full development and fiber development and
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at seven in the morning,
10, a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red here is the dry treatment,
and the blue is the wet treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you kind of see on this axis
here, this is the canopy temperature here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you increase the temperature in
terms of like during the day, the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic variance is also increasing as
well as the plants are becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about this,
we were able to now break up the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: into these different developmental phases,
and what we found is the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature phenotypes themselves were
more highly correlated within a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that's telling you is there's
somewhat maybe of a coordination of genes
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves within an actual plant growth
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this gave us the idea,
okay, since we're seeing these patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that may suggest that there is maybe
certain QTLs in terms of their expression
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns turning on and off in the genome
over the growth phase of the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinant embryo line population,
and some of that is perturbed by heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that is actually what we
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have, what we're revealing here
is this distinct temporal patterns of the
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL effects that's controlling canopy
temperature variation in this recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo line population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the QTLs that we detected under
the control wet treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the QTL that we controlled under
the dry treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the effects of the QTL that
decreased canopy temperature here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in blue, and in the red are QTL
effects that are increasing canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see here is depending on
the age of the actual plant, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL are actually being triggered and
turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the intensity, if you will,
the size of the effect of the QTL is also
[SPEAKER_00]: partly being driven by the drought
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing about a genome is you
can find any possible candidate gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this region of the cotton
genome where we had a QTL map,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found a gene for an ABA response
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I found was
pretty exciting at the time is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL for variability in cotton leaf ABA
content also mapped to that same region of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that seems to jive is in a sense
when you have ABA, it's contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The model size and how it's going to open
and close, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite possible that this QTL is in
fact contributing to variability and
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in transpiration rate in this
part of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would obviously then drive
changes in canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Duke-Pauley contributed to this
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask him all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we also want to think about in
terms of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when here on the X axis here,
we have lint yield and temperature on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Y axis, what we have found is,
you know, that increase in leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rate under drought stress
actually contributes to higher lint yield
[SPEAKER_00]: in a heavily irrigated hot air
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants over here are the ones
that take a risk under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, they're not shutting down and
they're continuing to have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having that, they can continue to
fix carbon and in a sense have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants over here are the ones that
decide to shut down, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix less carbon now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they will yield less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a heavily irrigated environment such
as Al West in Arizona, you would perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: want a genotype such as this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a dry land environment
that's only rain fed, perhaps you would
[SPEAKER_00]: want a genotype that's more conservative
over in this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will perhaps be calibrated to use
water, only perhaps a, like, fill of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grain or at flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also found is at all these
various time points that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping across the field season,
the most informative was at flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the reason why is, after you have
all this heat, what's going to suffer?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's going to be the flowers
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's high heat, the pollen isn't
going to be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it isn't going to be viable,
there isn't going to be seed set and there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to be any fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is the fun part with LIDAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're putting this on our tractor,
and now we're trying to recreate the 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of defoliated cotton plants in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our entire field right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one, say, like 28 foot plot of
defoliated cotton plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is all these
cloud points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Todd was touching it on cloud points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd points in his talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a sense, these are recapitulating
the actual cotton balls on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually take out, like,
a single plant and do a Euclidean
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a sense, try to get closer to
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we're just counting the cotton
balls on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of future in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's turn to deep learning,
which we all love, and artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since coming to Cornell, I've been
working with some plant pathologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I found are exciting people to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions we had,
here we have a phenotype that's caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this disease is northern corn leaf
plight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you hire maybe four or five
undergrads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show them one leaf, and you force them
out to go to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to now do phenotyping for
NCLB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just showed them this one,
which has NCLB.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they see all these other examples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be so much easier just to
train a robot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, it's important to invest in
our youth of tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea is training these
convolutional neural networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you refer to as in the old
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep learning and now AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to combine this with drones
to detect these NCLB lesions on maize
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to turn drones to just, for just being
something fun you see flying around or
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to tear out of my kid's hands when
we're going to target, is that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually turning them into a coworker and
a colleague now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is, you have your drones
flying over top of plots of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have your RGB 3DR iris cannon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is a disease lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, you don't want to take,
as was shown earlier, perhaps like 80,000
[SPEAKER_00]: images and try to pick these out by eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to train these CNNs and to detect
NCLB in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is we haven't evolved to the
point where the AIs can train themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure that's coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, you can just kind of view it as
the CNN here is converting pixels into
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the awesome thing, it doesn't need to
be linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use curves and shapes and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where presence, absence,
and a human being, terrain plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathologists, have to classify this is a
disease lesion or it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been told by the colleagues on
this project, after they would do maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: several hundred of these per day,
when they would close their eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would see the disease lesions on the
back of their eyelids when they would go
[SPEAKER_00]: to bed at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do feel kind of horrible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all in the name of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have, this was taken from,
if you will, a person as they walk through
[SPEAKER_00]: the field with a handheld camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of view this from the
point of view of like a ground vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have all the ones from the
drones that we're training on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we trained on close to 2,000
photos that have been classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have our AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all our disease lesions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our AI, this is kind of viewed as a
heat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's white, that means it has a
probability of, in a sense, that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's black, there is none where it's
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when they are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they aren't present, then you
should have an AI trained very well so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you shouldn't detect any lesions when
there are none present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case here, we do not find
anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after training on these 2,000s for
this set that we have, we found maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we're only wrong maybe 2% to 3% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps when we train on 10,000 more,
we can maybe increase that even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a very fun experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an active area of research in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on our bread project, it's kind of the
same concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, changing to our handheld phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a colleague of mine where he,
in a sense, has developed AI to detect the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease that's infecting a cassava plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, a farmer or a breeder
can take a picture of a diseased cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the AI runs on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually, it can be sent to the cloud
where it's processed there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with a certain probability,
it'll tell you what cassava disease it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, for our TARA project
that we have, we've kind of taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: approach for trying to develop low-cost,
autonomous field robots that can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, with our colleagues,
the University of UIUC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is so you can do canopy
reflectance, canopy temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and canopy geometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's on board processing as this can
transect like the plots in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's recording other climatic factors
such as like soil temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first version 1, it'll cost about
$200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're very hopeful that we can get the
price down to like $20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can kind of think of a world
where we have these in everyone's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so we're testing this on biomass
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my group, we're creating a map for
a few hundred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is we can then develop like a
time series for like G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these variants in the HapMap across
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see like genes that are being turned
on and off as I was showing with cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really be getting to factor in that G
by E component to try to figure out why it
[SPEAKER_00]: is being turned on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think about in the future where
I kind of see my work proceeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders have a tremendous eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at some point we can clone it
with AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have these autonomous
breeding, now I'm not going to call them
[SPEAKER_00]: autonomous breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to assist the breeders
because of course we don't want to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to do is basically clone
the breeder's eye and perhaps maybe have
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 10 to 20 of these very low cost
robots per breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps there's maybe some simplistic
traits in early generation breeding such
[SPEAKER_00]: as height plant pathology traits that if
you have maybe tens of thousands of like
[SPEAKER_00]: head rows or something like that,
that these robots could actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and help pinpoint and then track
by GPS certain plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the breeder isn't happy with
the plants that are chosen, then he or she
[SPEAKER_00]: can just re-train the AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're kind of at a point now
when we need to be having that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with all the computer
scientists, all of the robotic engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: on campus to really push our science to a
place that we haven't really conceived
[SPEAKER_00]: quite yet because these things are now
becoming possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Cornell is at a place where we
can drive this to become a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank all of my
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will take maybe one
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to keep you from your
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can resume back at 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Tim Sutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of my field in Aurora,
New York, I want to build a robot that can
[SPEAKER_00]: go out and pick every stone out of my
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first one I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the area in virotyping is
going to be, I think, the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can think of having maybe
low-cost ways to sense at the plots,
[SPEAKER_00]: like soil temperature, how much soil water
moisture is in each plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a certain area, you can record
the ambient air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like other factors over the whole
growing season, then you can think about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing factorial regression and trying to
figure out what is the contribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: these changes in the E that's contributing
to my G and my G by E over the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are some things that are
coming out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not cheap enough to the point
where you're able just to put one probe
[SPEAKER_00]: per one plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps you can try to characterize the
actual variation in your field and then
[SPEAKER_00]: use an approach to try to close that gap,
if you will, to fill in those void areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have no probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think we really need to
go towards that G by E question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you at 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
