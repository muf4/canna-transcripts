[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Tony said, I'm trying for the
longest title.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you look at the schedule,
I've got some stiff competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me try to break down the title for
about the first half of the talk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are ecosystem services?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it's jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's useful jargon to help us
talk about we really want a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits from the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from agricultural land, we want more
than food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want clean air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want bioenergy, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that we want from
the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I think this is useful jargon?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it points out that we only pay for
some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly or not, the things we pay
for get a lot more attention than the
[SPEAKER_01]: things we don't pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in economic terms, if we make payments
for some of these services that we want
[SPEAKER_01]: that currently aren't being paid for,
we bring them within our economic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get more attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we get more of the things
we need from the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why pay for reducing nutrient losses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the answer is kind of simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we lose nutrients from fields where
we can cause water pollution, either local
[SPEAKER_01]: streams, groundwater, or the coastal zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the coastal zones in the
country and many in the world are polluted
[SPEAKER_01]: with excess nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,
there have been efforts for decades to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce nutrient loading, nutrient
pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So payments are already being made today
to agricultural producers to improve water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality in the Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the main focuses we had in this
project was looking at the potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: replace some maize in the watershed with
switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the benefit of this is a very large
reduction in nitrate leaching and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the coastal zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This research was funded by a regional
bioenergy project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a specific interest in looking
at the potential for bioenergy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioenergy has trouble competing with
fossil fuels due to cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So natural gas is relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biorefineries probably aren't really
willing to pay enough to producers for the
[SPEAKER_01]: feedstocks to make the whole system
viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to bring in that ecosystem
services theme again, if we had a system
[SPEAKER_01]: where we were paying for the carbon
pollution from fossil fuels, that would
[SPEAKER_01]: change that equation pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to really get further
into that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the motivations for
bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gets to why the title is so long,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't just have bioenergy or
switchgrass, but also cover crops and also
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen fertilizer management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe these things are in here
because I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think it makes sense to look
at competing options.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of research gets done in a bit of a
silo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a topic like this, there are
alternatives, other ways we can reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we should be trying to compare
those and see what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as many of you know very intimately,
there's lots of room for improvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen fertilizer management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we should be thinking
about in this realm of making payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if we're going to make a
payment for a cover crop to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen to the Chesapeake Bay,
should we pay for whatever farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing now?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're applying excess fertilizer and
causing unnecessary pollution and losing
[SPEAKER_01]: money doing it, should we pay them from
that as a baseline?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we pay them to an improved
management practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or should we pay them from if you are
managing fertilizer in a reasonable way,
[SPEAKER_01]: then a cover crop will have a smaller
benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already reduced a good deal of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of baseline issue becomes
important when you get into making
[SPEAKER_01]: payments and sort of the policy aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got seven steps in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read them all because
we're going to march through each one
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, what we're trying to do is
we need to estimate how much nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from corn fields right now and
reaching the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much could we reduce that with
some of these different practices like
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops or switchgrass or improved
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilizer management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the way, we have to get into the
economics of switchgrass a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not really currently a major
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't just look at the market to
tell us what is the cost to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: switchgrass?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the price out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have to come up with an
estimate of what would you have to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: switchgrass to make it worthwhile for the
farmer to produce it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the last step, again,
because switchgrass isn't being produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do analyses of what we think makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we want to say there's going to be
a big increase in switchgrass production,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to cause changes in
agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're competing for land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use an agricultural sector model to
try to say, OK, we've got some technical
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what might happen if you put this in
the system we have with competition for
[SPEAKER_01]: land and demand for other crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our general approach, although I'm a
modeler, I guess I call myself kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: reluctant modeler.
[SPEAKER_01]: My training is really in experimental work
more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stick with biophysical and economic
data whenever we can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first place we went to for our
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're supplementing with models
basically when we have to, when there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: other way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, especially for some of
those who know me, we focused on just
[SPEAKER_01]: average values throughout the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a geospatial analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this first step of nitrogen loading
to the bay, we need to know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer growers are applying to their
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of you know this is surprisingly
hard to get at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to one of our colleagues here,
Harold Van Ness, and his lab did strip
[SPEAKER_01]: trials on a bunch of farms in a bunch of
years in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually found out what growers
are applying to corn fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we felt like that was actually one of
the better data sources for what people
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the yields of all those strip
trials, I think there were 50 site years,
[SPEAKER_01]: the yields were a bit higher than the
average yields for maize in the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the average grower rate from
those strip trials and we adjusted it
[SPEAKER_01]: downward because of the lower average corn
yields in the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next step, so we also need to know
what's the nitrate leaching from corn
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, another benefit of us looking
at these ADAPTN strip trial results is the
[SPEAKER_01]: ADAPTN model provides a good estimate of
that amount of nitrate leaching below the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the data, the actual data on
yields and on the grower practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have modeled nitrate leaching data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have to say, okay, it's a long
way from below the rooting zone to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chesapeake Bay, especially if we look at
the northern portions of the watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some losses of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to estimate that, we used some
previously published basin-wide models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if we replace maize with
switchgrass, what kind of a reduction are
[SPEAKER_01]: we gonna get?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanna introduce a little bit of
jargon here, nitrogen loading as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to nitrogen leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I don't mix them up, what I'll try
to do is talk about nitrogen leaching at a
[SPEAKER_01]: field to mean the amount of nitrogen
getting below the rooting zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen loading is used for how much,
in our case, how much is reaching the bay?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only tricky part here is sometimes we
can talk about nitrogen loading on a
[SPEAKER_01]: per-hectare basis, remembering that
there's a little bit of loss in that river
[SPEAKER_01]: system, but we can still sort of allocate
the nitrogen load in the bay back upstream
[SPEAKER_01]: to say where it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few published measurements
of leaching from field studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we looked at both with nitrogen
fertilizer and without for switchgrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: because some people have been promoting
the idea that you should be growing it
[SPEAKER_01]: without nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, wouldn't you reduce nitrate leaching
even more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the limited field data say,
yes, you reduce it, but it's already
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only getting another kilogram of
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then this cover crop, winter cover crop
idea, we also need to quantify what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit of a winter rye cover crop on
maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that, again, we went to the
literature for field studies that were
[SPEAKER_01]: greater than one year, and we just,
these were the best studies that we found
[SPEAKER_01]: and we took the average.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these studies suggest that a winter rye
cover crop is reducing nitrate leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: about half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about nitrogen fertilizer
management?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned that, you know,
we think there's a lot of room for
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the ADAPT-N tool is very
helpful here because it's designed to give
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a best management practice
recommendation for the nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for consistency, we can use those same
recommendations from that set of strip
[SPEAKER_01]: trials on farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we can adjust that based on the
difference in the higher average yield in
[SPEAKER_01]: the strip trials compared to the average
yields in the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, the losses from the field
to the bay, we use the same method I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, which is basically results of
previous basin scale modeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now we get to talk about money
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were after was, our thinking
is, no reasonable producer is gonna plant
[SPEAKER_01]: switchgrass instead of maize unless they
can get at least equal the profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to calculate, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to know what's the profit that
farmers are getting from their maize
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of you who've done this know this
is a very sticky area, but we took 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years of published enterprise budgets from
USDA so that if people don't like our
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, at least we can point to USDA
instead of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took the average of that,
but adjusting it for inflation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we created our own enterprise
budget for switchgrass by starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: that maize budget and modifying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to plant every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's basically less equipment,
less fertilizer, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we started with the USDA budget to be
as consistent as possible with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we adjusted things that we knew would
be quite different and we could quantify
[SPEAKER_01]: that fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to know, right, and so then
we could estimate a cost for that
[SPEAKER_01]: switchgrass production, but we have to
know the yield in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here again, so we use a simulation
model for a representative site.
[SPEAKER_01]: To estimate an average switchgrass yield,
we came up just about 10 tons per hectare,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very close to the average value
from a bunch of field trials throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of reassuring at least when
those things match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what about this idea of payments
for nitrogen reduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, they're already being made
and we focused on Maryland, in 2015 they
[SPEAKER_01]: were paying farmers almost $150 a hectare
for planting winter cover crops in maize
[SPEAKER_01]: fields on about 200,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took that as, okay, this is at least
what Maryland is willing to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used our own calculation of the
nitrogen benefit of that practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the estimate of nitrogen rate leaching
that I mentioned previously and this per
[SPEAKER_01]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount, we calculated the amount of
nitrogen, the amount of reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could come up with how many
kilograms of nitrogen per acre is the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit and then divide that by into the
148,000 dollars to come up with $13 per
[SPEAKER_01]: kilogram of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the payment that's being made,
we think this is what they're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting when they pay that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we assume the same rate per kilogram of
nitrogen reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume that same rate would apply to
switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another wrinkle for this idea
of growing switchgrass without nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem there is you're getting lower
yields because you're not applying
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, again, you're going to have to
make up that cost to make it worthwhile to
[SPEAKER_01]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with a higher cost for the
nitrogen reduction because you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower yield and you have to make up that
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we accounted for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a separate enterprise budget for
switchgrass without nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You save money on the nitrogen,
but you get a substantial yield penalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've been reading the bottom
right of these slides, this won't be the
[SPEAKER_01]: only photo that Jeff Malkonian was kind
enough to share with me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so last step of the methods
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try to read this entire
slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say, kind of reiterate what
I said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was our motivation for using an
agricultural sector model?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, the motivation is really,
we're talking about, if we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about hundreds of thousands of hectares of
switchgrass production, that's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: change from what's going on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to affect, you can't ignore
the fact that that would presumably
[SPEAKER_01]: increase if you're replacing maize,
then there's going to be a demand for
[SPEAKER_01]: maize that doesn't just disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this model is a way to deal with that
issue in a quantitative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it models the whole country because
that actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we're interested in the
Chesapeake Bay watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this model was run with this change in
the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to look at that in the
context of the agricultural sector of the
[SPEAKER_01]: US.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I'll take a little brief
pause here and see if there's any more
[SPEAKER_01]: questions or comments about the methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the funding for this project was
oriented towards bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people have suggested growing
legumes or leguminous mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of problems with that
for many types of bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we chose switchgrass as kind of a
representative crop that's received the
[SPEAKER_01]: most attention as a bioenergy feedstock in
terms of the entire logistical chain and
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rationale there is the maize is a
energy crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rationale was we wanted to pick a
perennial bioenergy feedstock that might
[SPEAKER_01]: go in place of maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there'd be a whole bunch you
could choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt like switchgrass was a good choice
if we're going to only have one choice.
Of
[SPEAKER_09]: course, in terms of maize in the US,
what fraction would it
be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is quite a bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the Midwest, yeah, about half of it
at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably more if you count grain
imports, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are growing and selling
grain here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then grains getting imported into the
region.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would not say that our goal is not
to say planting switchgrass is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of all the possible alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we wanted to restrict ourselves to
one bioenergy feedstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we chose that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe a more useful answer to you
and to other folks, and in fact to me as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we can think about switchgrass as
kind of a representative perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen benefit, the legumes gets a
little more complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for non-leguminous perennial crops,
they're going to have a very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate leaching to switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole bunch of different
perennials that you could grow that would
[SPEAKER_01]: have a similar benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, with the caveat about
you have to look a little more closely at
[SPEAKER_01]: the legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just following up on that, cover crops are
reducing nitrate leaching by half on
[SPEAKER_07]: average.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's set aside, where's that nitrate
going?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you optimize nitrogen management
on the maize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you look at that as another option?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we looked at that in two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One as kind of a potential competitor to
the switchgrass idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at nitrogen improved
fertilizer management and cover crops as
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors to switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another good competitor might be some
other mix of a feed forage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another wrinkle there is, as I think I
mentioned, if you improve the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: management and then you have a cover crop,
if you're getting the same proportional
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, then you're not reducing as many
kilograms of nitrogen loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that becomes, I think, kind of a
policy and management question of,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you want to credit that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love manure, but we stayed away from it
for this study.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we looked at inorganic nitrogen
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at corn, grain production only,
not silage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for bringing that up,
because that does, when I talk about kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of corn area and how do we scale up,
it's important to know that it's corn for
[SPEAKER_01]: grain only.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so finally some results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is nitrogen loading to the bay
from some of these options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is loading, meaning how
much arrives in the bay, but then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking back upstream and expressing this
as kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can sort of think about it at the
field scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the black bar is our estimate of how
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So saying more than 30 kilograms per
hectare of nitrogen are reaching the bay
[SPEAKER_01]: from the average cornfield in the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say just the losses in the transport
through the watershed obviously vary
[SPEAKER_01]: through the watershed, depending where you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on average, it's not that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the sort of main stem of the
river, it's just a few percent on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much harder to estimate what's
happening between below the rooting zone
[SPEAKER_01]: and the streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think that's on the order of
something like 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the more difficult numbers
to come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the blue bar is, so it says BMP for
best management practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the adapt N, applying that
adapt N rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is using a cover crop in
comparison to the average management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if we use a cover crop on top of
the best management practice, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: down here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then switchgrass, with or without
nitrogen, is quite low.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so how much would you have to
pay a grower for a ton of switchgrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: a metric ton of switchgrass, to equal the
profit from corn?
[SPEAKER_01]: We came up with $111.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just shows where this estimate
falls in all the other estimates I could
[SPEAKER_01]: find in the literature, sort of by region
of the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're somewhere in the low end for the
Midwest and North Central, and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit higher than some of the estimates for
the Southeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another result here is if we took that $13
per pound of nitrogen payment for the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen benefit of switchgrass,
and we multiply that times, or if we
[SPEAKER_01]: express that per ton of switchgrass,
it comes out to $24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually a substantial fraction
of that $111 there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the payment that Maryland's making
right now is not an insignificant one in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the total value of the system
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now we scale up to the
watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a map of the Chesapeake Bay
watershed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who aren't familiar,
here's the New York boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ithaca's right in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have the Chesapeake Bay
watershed is east and west of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Pennsylvania has a lot of the
agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the basin, as well as Virginia,
Maryland, and Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our estimate of the total
achievable basin-wide nitrogen loading
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a goal for the Bay,
which is set based on what scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: think how much nitrogen needs to be
reduced to restore the health of the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's this number here, about 27
gigagrams per ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how far can we get with some of these
different options we've been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in this scaling up, we had to make
some assumptions about how much land could
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply these practices on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a very important assumption that
if lands already had a nitrogen management
[SPEAKER_01]: practice of some kind, based on data from
the USDA, we wouldn't apply another one on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that for simplicity and because we
want to make sure we're not double
[SPEAKER_01]: counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a little bit conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is certainly room for additional
land that could have more than one
[SPEAKER_01]: practice on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're under counting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you remember for the May's best
management practice for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, it wasn't as big a benefit as
the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are they the same here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone want to take a guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we looked at the report from USDA
about nitrogen management practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was more of that land that we
thought was eligible for the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: management than for the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the switchgrass with nitrogen
and switchgrass without nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're almost the same because you don't
get much additional benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much more room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black bar here is from running that
agricultural sector model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on our kind of break-even
calculation of growing switchgrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: making the same profit as May's,
we come up with this amount of area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But running that model that accounts for
competition between switchgrass and other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, we come up with a smaller area of
switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_09]: No,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the target.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get this much reduction from
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't all have to come from ag,
but it has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's substantial, especially because
the ADAPTN results suggest farmers can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually increase profits with ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are all reductions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a question about the eligibility for
the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that based on how many farmers are
regrowing cover crops on land?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the data that I've seen suggests
that it's a very small amount of farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: that are actually using cover crops across
the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data for the Northeast is a little
harder to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we get into sort of data
quality and other interesting issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used USDA reports of nitrogen
management practices on fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get the raw data, and it's very
hard for me to evaluate the accuracy of
[SPEAKER_01]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't break things out very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say there's a lot of
uncertainty about how much land would be
[SPEAKER_01]: available for cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to, you know, I think there's
certainly room for multiple practices on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same piece of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess in brief, what you're saying
is, yes, there's uncertainty about what
[SPEAKER_01]: those practices are, how much is actually
being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people may be getting... So this
brings up an important issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Maryland is paying for 200,000 hectares
in 2015, did they get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they did, what did the cover crop
look like on all those acres?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it look good or, you know,
was it planted too late?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then across in other states,
too, that don't have that payment,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect it to be much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'll move on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But acknowledging there's uncertainties
here, and there's probably room for more
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement than we're listing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're jumping back to per
hectare here, and this is gross value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means what's being paid for the
product of that land?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the product is either maize or
switchgrass, or we're calling a
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen-loading benefit, we're calling
that a product, because the farmer's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting paid for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how much is being paid for these
services, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per hectare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the maize is the same for all these
three, because we're assuming that yields
[SPEAKER_01]: are not affected by improving your
nitrogen management or by planting a cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, other people, you know, there's,
again, that's an assumption, a simplifying
[SPEAKER_01]: assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit, you get paid more for it for
the cover crop or the value of,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more nitrogen reduction from the
cover crop than there is from the improved
[SPEAKER_01]: management practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this isn't profit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even more from switchgrass,
but there's, and here, so this gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of how are you going to interpret
this price?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who gets the payment?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set this so that the payment here
was the total of the value of the maize
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, we said the farmer's going
to get paid this, and then they can sell
[SPEAKER_01]: that switchgrass to a refinery for less
than $111.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also give that payment on top of
the payment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could give, so this is a policy
question, what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we set this so that with the idea
of the farmer making the same profit as
[SPEAKER_01]: this one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general point here is just if
you're really looking for water quality
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, you might make a different choice
than if you're looking for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maize production or switchgrass
production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending what you're choosing,
there's going to be some trade-offs here
[SPEAKER_01]: of which option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not showing farmer profit,
but I'm quite confident this is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave, did you want to fix something I did
here?
[SPEAKER_10]: This one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a per hectare basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't give you as big a benefit as
these other ones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A half or a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are more acres that you can
apply that to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are coming out kind of similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I would say there's room for
these to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, based on this quality of the data,
how many acres are really available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were sort of erring on the side of
we would rather make a lower total
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate here with a lot of uncertainty
rather than a higher one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one reason for that is, you know,
getting people to change their practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: validating, verifying that that's
happening, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges besides just
kind of an equal profit point.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so some concluding thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on all the good questions we've
had here, you can see why I have thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than conclusions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope we'll have some more discussion
about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first point is, this may seem sort of
trivial, this $111, but I've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: on bioenergy for more than 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a shocking number to almost
everybody who's been involved in bioenergy
[SPEAKER_01]: for all those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think that's way high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been making this argument for a
long time that bioenergy is not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be viable unless the growers are getting,
you know, something that makes it work for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an incredible mismatch in what
people think biorefineries can pay and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they think they can pay a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general idea here, you know,
we're showing at least according to our
[SPEAKER_01]: assumptions, yes, there's room to improve
the profitability of bioenergy production
[SPEAKER_01]: and improve water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some room for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's room to meet 11% of that
nitrogen reduction goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other practices that could
provide this benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So improved nitrogen management and cover
crops could provide a little bit greater
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comparison isn't quite equal because
we only ran that agriculture sector model
[SPEAKER_01]: for the switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason was, with these options,
you're maintaining maize production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't feel like we need to run that
model, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not changing maize production at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just changing the nitrogen loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this was important to me,
even though the funding's from bioenergy,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, this idea makes sense, but there are
other ideas that kind of look like they
[SPEAKER_01]: may make more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily have to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could potentially try all of these
ideas, possibly in some combinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the maize at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of other benefits that we have in
quantified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus and sediment reduction from
planting perennials in place of annuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: wildlife habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I mentioned greenhouse gases,
not part of our analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's an important thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to recognize, you know, we have to
keep our scope manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, it's one of the challenges of
getting into ecosystem services is how far
[SPEAKER_01]: are you willing to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of them are you willing to try to
quantify?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transaction costs means, okay,
Maryland is willing to pay this money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer's willing to accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody has to, you know,
put it in their pocket and carry it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might have to also sort of look
around and see whether they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pay it or not, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That all, that costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't account for those costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also lag time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an atom or a molecule of nitrate
leaving a maize field does not arrive in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bay the next instant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes weeks or years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a lag time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start paying the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start paying for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefits will start to show up over a
period of months and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be an issue for policy
makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue about shifting maize production
elsewhere, we handled that by using an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural sector model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least we formally accounted for that
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to remember that just
because that economic model said,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, we can, we can get the system to
work and grow some switchgrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: we may have shifted nitrate pollution from
the Chesapeake Bay to the Mississippi
[SPEAKER_01]: River Basin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing to watch out for
is that shifting the problem elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked a little bit in response to
Tim's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of other things, lots of
other perennials that can be grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of other things that can be done with
perennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this, our intent was a stand-in
perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that switchgrass is the only one
that should be thought about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank Jeff again for photos
and also for lots of discussion and help
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's right across the hall and I bother
him every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shai and Harold were very kind in
providing results and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are now published.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will come up on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, this was USDA funding for
a regional USDA coordinated agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: project called the Northeast Woody Warm
Season Biomass Consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literature cited, I will just point out
this last one is basically all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: work is in press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should contain all these other
citations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's biomass and bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll flip back now to the consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including thoughts and hope we have time
for some questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, let's thank first of all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do
[SPEAKER_10]: we know how distance from the Chesapeake
Bay affects the quantity of nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, if you're in Maryland,
you're a lot closer than you are in New
[SPEAKER_10]: York.
[SPEAKER_10]: So therefore, it seems like you would want
to concentrate on those areas.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there are big differences if you
don't concentrate on those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we obviously don't have any
results from this study to answer that
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it makes a big difference how
close you are to the bay and how close you
[SPEAKER_01]: are to a stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wherever you are in the watershed,
that adjacency to surface water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other things are going to matter
too, like hopefully you're not plowing up
[SPEAKER_01]: and down the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the model that we use for the delivery
once you reach the river system suggested
[SPEAKER_01]: only about a 2% loss on average throughout
the whole basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a literature on this that I
haven't written that I've read.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is based on the Sparrow model,
which is a statistical model.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have made measurements of this,
but it's tough to make the measurements
[SPEAKER_01]: and integrate them at the basin scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my guess is that the adjacency to
flowing surface water is more important
[SPEAKER_01]: than where you are in the basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's other things about the
terrain itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting surface flow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting flooding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a riparian buffer of any kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soil type, how sandy is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sandy soils, the nitrates flowing
through them rapidly, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the losses before you reach the
stream are much higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johannes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering whether you did some
sensitivity analysis or error estimates or
[SPEAKER_06]: get a feeling for where there are more
improvements by stacking the different
[SPEAKER_06]: management options or by improving any one
of them even further.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you didn't do that, what's your gut
feeling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the quick answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal was to try to come up with the
best average we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it was a scope question for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have probably estimates.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the adapt-end experiments themselves
have probably an error estimate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some do it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some do it less good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you could compare that with
stacking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is multiple adoption a better pathway,
finding ways of adopting multiple best
[SPEAKER_06]: management or improved management
techniques rather than trying to improve
[SPEAKER_06]: any one of them even further?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think there's... Invest our
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked a little about spatial
variation and about nitrogen transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously that applies within the
field, what gets leached, what's getting
[SPEAKER_01]: volatilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot going on within the field
that's variable spatially as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on soil properties and
management, cropping system, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that said, we didn't try to come up
with kind of an optimal mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that to some extent, what you
would wanna do next to build on this and
[SPEAKER_01]: take it further depends kind of on your
starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking to improve profit for the
farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, the first thing is the
nitrogen management because the adapt-end
[SPEAKER_01]: results strongly support the idea that you
save the farmer money, you increase
[SPEAKER_01]: profit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems like a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we pay to try to make that happen,
there's a profit potential there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems like the most obvious thing
to do in terms of farmer profitability and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some nitrogen benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a policy perspective, then I think
that should be the first focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, okay, once you've done all of
that, you go into, are you interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops or are you interested in
perennials?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the answer to that is how
concerned are you about shifting demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And realistically, nobody should plant
switchgrass based on this study,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's gonna buy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is supporting strategic planning at a
multi-decade level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another, I don't know if I'm
answering your question at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the uncertainty in the nitrogen
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is being quantified by other
people already, adapt-end and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that already exists to a great extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cover crop benefit, this is pretty
simplistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an average value from the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are many things that can be
done to improve a cover crop management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly if you plant it too late and
you don't have much of a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not gonna get much of a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm getting at this at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering that your variation
that you took the average from,
[SPEAKER_06]: is the variation so large?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just uncertainty and not
knowing, but there's a real variation in
[SPEAKER_06]: the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody doing it well, somebody doing it
not well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that variation around cover crops so
large that it would work whether you can
[SPEAKER_06]: do cover crops plus BNP?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that feeling for what's the variation
in any one management versus opportunity
[SPEAKER_06]: to stack to management?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't reduce the nitrogen additions to
maize and switch to switch crop,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When there are options that don't stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so let me make a distinction between
uncertainty and variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So variability would be something that is
at least theoretically, at least it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible to predict it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And uncertainty is kind of irreducible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the variability we talked about a
little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that, so a next step beyond
this would be a geospatial analysis to say
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are is gonna affect nitrogen
transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna affect nitrogen leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna affect probably a little bit
about the cropping system, the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long that cover crop is there,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot is known about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could improve on this estimate by
quantifying how some of that variability
[SPEAKER_01]: affects these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The uncertainty, we haven't tried to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt might have a better idea on the cover
crop side.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big concern I always have, taking an
average of a bunch of published studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bunch of ain't over 10 of grad
students out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they were doing the best possible
job they could on those experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not a luxury that farmers
have, even if they are that motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have the same mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always worry when we take data from
the literature, maybe it's the best we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know with yield trials,
there's a pretty big yield gap between
[SPEAKER_01]: yield trials for maize in New York and
what farmers are getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gap, by my analysis, is growing
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if we're not doing our job
or the farmers aren't, but we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: narrowing that gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worry about that in this kind of
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry about that first, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, that and the variability,
I think, would answer quite a bit of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting at, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're past time, but one question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say I like the
analysis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's potentially really
valuable to show the problem and how,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe, financial incentives could be used
to help solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, what I would like is
what you said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's to give, let's say,
the farmers a suite of options that would
[SPEAKER_08]: be qualified for some kind of incentive
payments.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm wondering if, as you thought about
that, transfer of payments and so forth,
[SPEAKER_08]: the extent to which it would be necessary
to use finance as opposed to the balance
[SPEAKER_08]: between that and an educational extension
type program.
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, people change their
behavior if they just knew what the
[SPEAKER_08]: problem is and what they could do to help
solve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so people who do more extension than
I do might have an answer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, in the context of this,
study, the whole concept of payment for
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem services is, yeah, people pay
attention when you talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you give them money, they pay
more attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other concept is,
if we pay for corn, we're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want improved water quality,
we've got to figure out how to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the answer about the best
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by having some things that we pay for
and other things that we don't pay for but
[SPEAKER_01]: that we want, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been a real reluctance to
regulate agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So top-down regulation is another approach
rather than payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's politically usually not very
viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's challenging even if you pass a
law, how do you implement that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
