[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, thanks to Anu and
Kathy and many others for the invitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty special visit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get back here often enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of my degrees are from Cornell,
so I'm here visiting very special people
[SPEAKER_00]: and very special places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister is one of the staff members here
at Cornell University who continues to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a great institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, the maid of honor at our wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the first seminar my wife
has ever seen me give.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got married at the A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixon White House just down the road,
so it's an incredibly romantic time,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have two full-time jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is the faculty director for InFact,
and the other is the Kellogg chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you a little bit
about the agri-ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we think about agri-ecosystems and
agri-ecosystem health, because that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to do with the way we shaped our
proposal for what became and is becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: the initiative for food and agricultural
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is me a few years ago when I was
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I got my start as a scout for
the New York IPM programs, scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbage and vegetables across western New
York, first for the IPM programs and then
[SPEAKER_00]: as a private consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would count bugs and help farmers
try to figure out what to do about these
[SPEAKER_00]: insect pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept asking, you know, well isn't
there a better way that we could be going
[SPEAKER_00]: about this whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start asking those kind of
questions, pretty soon you're in a career
[SPEAKER_00]: in research, and that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I continued to work on some of
these pests in the earlier part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: career at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the diamondback moth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a broccoli floret, and they're a
big problem in broccoli florets because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't wash them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 80s and 90s at least,
most of your frozen broccoli was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from central Mexico, the Bahio region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it led to work with researchers down
there where they were setting out
[SPEAKER_00]: pheromone traps for these moths and
checking them three times a week every
[SPEAKER_00]: single week from 1987 to 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as entomologists, we don't get data
sets like this very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this led to some questions about what
is going on in the system that would lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to this kind of pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we showed is three kind of
distinct periods here where the pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: was changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one where there was this kind of
regular cyclical pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using time series analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a period where the populations
increased and the fluctuations got really
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a period where they dropped down
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same pattern of how increases
follow decreases has been maintained since
[SPEAKER_00]: this drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this had a little bit more to do with
weather than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and what we were finding is in
looking at what was going on in this agro
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem that would best explain what was
going on with this particular pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really a lot about the amount of
broccoli that they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went from 8,000 hectares to 40,000
hectares of broccoli during this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a heck of a lot of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is create an enormous
carrying capacity for pests like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pest wasn't the only issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were starting to have problems with
groundwater, with salinization of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, with markets, with labor
availability, to the extent that the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing companies down there that were
part of this industry were already looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at other parts of the world to move and
get out of this region of central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you keep focusing on just one
problem, then usually you miss what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grand tradition in entomology of
solving one problem and creating three
[SPEAKER_00]: more in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great for jobs security,
but after a while it starts to feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: game of whack-a-mole where you just keep
going from one problem to the next and
[SPEAKER_00]: fixing that and then moving on to the next
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to step back and take a look at
the system instead of looking at one
[SPEAKER_00]: problem after the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, we have a tradition in
entomology of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a tradition of this in the
land-grant system in general and in our
[SPEAKER_00]: food policy in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of wrapped up in this
Byzantine proverb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice who brings you this
proverb, but he who has bread has many
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He who has no bread has only one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's quite true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were experiencing that right after
the Great Depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just reading the other night,
something like 70% of the young men who
[SPEAKER_00]: joined the Civilian Conservation Corps
were malnourished and poorly clothed and
[SPEAKER_00]: the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When World War II came along, there were a
lot of people that were just not fit to
[SPEAKER_00]: serve in the military because they were
malnourished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you start having trouble raising an
army and governments get attentive to that
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of the resolve coming out
of that period in our history where there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a decision across government level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not going through those kind of
shortages again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that there's
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process, we've created a few
other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the bind that we tend to put
farmers in these days, this whole kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount that we all spend on food
that the farmer gets to keep over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years keeps shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our food prices are not going way
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the costs of what farmers have to
deal with in order to be really productive
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of inputs, the value added beyond
the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple ways out of this
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get really good at operating in
the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people tend to do there is get
specialized, expand, get bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: get really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get at using technology so that you can
produce a whole lot because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: making much on each unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other approach would be to try to
recapture some of the cost of these inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of the value that's added beyond
the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it's a very difficult task to
be a farmer these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Agro Ecosystems Management
Program, this is a group of faculty at
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio State University who are willing to
step back and work with partners outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the university on looking for balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's balance between the
environmental and the economic and social
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions of agriculture and considering
it as a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just farms, it's also neighboring
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a tradition very early on of
working with people outside the university
[SPEAKER_00]: because we found if this was a group of
academics talking about big systems kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff, it would get very ethereal very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were interested in making sure
this was grounded in something that would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we were asked
for very early on was we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this very complex system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's environment, it's economy,
it's social.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get your arms around this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a way of understanding how
we're doing as an agricultural ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out to construct an index of
agro ecosystem health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to do that,
you have to define health first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose this definition that was
proposed quite a while ago by Gordon
[SPEAKER_00]: Conway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was president of the Rockefeller
Foundation at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he described agro ecosystem health in
terms of these four properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further fleshed out what we mean by
each of those properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at those, you could
probably see already that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily things that are moving in
lockstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's trade-offs within that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's challenging anyway to talk about
agro ecosystem health in terms of those
[SPEAKER_00]: four properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with six key variables that to
us describe the processes that best led to
[SPEAKER_00]: a definition of those properties over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those key variables were kind of in
these six broad categories, soils and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health, topography, biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next three are social
economic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind the index that we came
up with is that you have a pattern on a
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have things flowing across the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's good, money going to farmers,
beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's bad, so pests and diseases
flowing between farm fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's just flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the pattern of sources and sinks
on the landscape that leads to those
[SPEAKER_00]: flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the flows that define the
processes that lead to those properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and sustainability,
stability and equitability over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, we combine those six
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually there were quite a few
indicators that led to those six variables
[SPEAKER_00]: using analytical hierarchy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combine that into an index of agro
ecosystem health that you can then map and
[SPEAKER_00]: get an idea of how you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compare one place to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more importantly, where agro
ecosystem health was a bit lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can drill down and figure out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the underlying variables that
you could work on to improve the health of
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the agro ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little bit of background on
how we think about agro ecosystems and
[SPEAKER_00]: agro ecosystem health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this combination of social and
biophysical dimensions combined that lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to this pattern on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy agro ecosystems are becoming very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some predictions that suggest
that agriculture is going to get harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: do over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the climate change
predictions for our part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the upper Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live right about there in Worcester,
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this map on the left, darker blue
means more predicted heavy rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in a part where we're expecting
more heavy rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one on the right is prediction for
increase in consecutive dry days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, we're there where it's a
little bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting more heavy rainfall
events and more consecutive dry days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wetter when it's wet, drier when it's dry,
and no predictability so far about what
[SPEAKER_00]: the pattern is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about three years of
drought and then three years of rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one month of drought, one month of
rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And until you can figure that out,
you really don't have a good way of
[SPEAKER_00]: adapting to that or knowing what you have
to do to adapt to that new pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, the element that best describes
these predictions of climate change is in
[SPEAKER_00]: this row in the periodic table of elements
that you usually don't spend much time on
[SPEAKER_00]: in chemistry class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a gap in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all start with UU, the element of
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that describes pretty well
what we're up against with climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a lot of surprises and a lot of them
not necessarily real pleasant surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you adapt agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how many of you have seen
this diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the resilience alliance,
and it's kind of an early version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: figures that they used to describe how
systems change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably recognize this continuum
from R to K, which is kind of the classic
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbed to more conserved kind of climax
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ecosystems and social systems tend
to go back and forth between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sustainable agriculture, a lot of what
we do is when we plow a field,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pushing it back towards this
exploitation area because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: exploit it for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we create an environment
that pests and diseases and the like can
[SPEAKER_00]: exploit very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of sustainable agriculture is
trying to strike that balance and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the system to act more like these
conserved systems where we get what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need out of it, but it's not so
exploitable by other organisms so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have these wild outbreaks of pests and
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all right, but what happens
occasionally is the environment changes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where everything that was
conserved and working real well here just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work anymore, and it all gets
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in that release, let's see,
is that mouse even working up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in that release, there's a chance
for all of that that had been conserved up
[SPEAKER_00]: here to get reorganized and then go back
into this cycle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that reorganization, you can
actually lose some capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think desertification or something like
that, loss of a seed bank, so you no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer have some of that capacity to
reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about resilience,
we're talking about what happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big change in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these predictions of climate change
would be a big change in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in which we're currently producing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that list of challenges is one that
Fred Kershenman throws at us all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part of this network of Kellogg
chairs and other scholars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk sustainable agriculture,
tell me how you're going to farm with
[SPEAKER_00]: higher temperatures, more extreme weather,
or half the water and oil at $300 a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be very difficult to do
agriculture the way we do it now under
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of environmental change
that will cause a big shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the definition of resilience is
about how much change the system can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and still bounce back to where it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this kind of stability part of
the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it take a shock and go back?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more important is when the
environment really changes, how can the
[SPEAKER_00]: system adapt and get through that what
they call in the resilience alliance the
[SPEAKER_00]: back loop of release and reorganization
and adapt and regain the functions that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really concerned about, like
everybody having enough to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of qualities of a system that
make it better able to go through that
[SPEAKER_00]: back loop of release and reorganization
are self-organization, the capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn and adapt, which typically requires
some diversity that you can then select
[SPEAKER_00]: from in that adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of qualities would we look
for in agro-ecosystems then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's diversity in terms of what
we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to markets in other part of
the world, you'll tend to find a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more things that people are eating than
what you'd find at Wegmans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably a whole lot of things
that people were eating in this area that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not consuming anymore that people
were eating before European settlers
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole lot of things out there
that we don't necessarily consume that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be thinking about the diversity
within the things that we do eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the phenotypic, genotypic,
and gene by environment interaction kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity that you have within crops,
a given crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's diversity in terms of
who's doing agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's down to about 1% of our
population that are on big farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people getting interested in
getting re-engaged with agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would give you some diversity once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, those
qualities, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: self-organization and innovation and some
of the things that link these dimensions
[SPEAKER_00]: of agro-ecosystem health, it's very
consistent, this idea of agro-ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: health leading to resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some ideas about that published
in a paper in Jess if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has kind of given us a lot of
guidance on the kind of work that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in the agro-ecosystems management
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a small and
mid-sized farms grant that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small farm just to the west of
Worcester that was donated to OARDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grant to look at the very early
stages of diversifying a farm that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: in corn and soybeans, not big enough to
really make a living doing corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not going to do that and do
economy of scale, then what are you going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And economists are calling this economy of
scope, the idea that you do diversify and
[SPEAKER_00]: then use the diversification as a way of
recapturing some of those input costs that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would otherwise be spending if you
were going the other route into economies
[SPEAKER_00]: of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got oilseed crops, forage,
vegetables, pasture poultry, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at in this project is
how quickly are the new benefits in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil quality, access to markets and
things like that, as well as new costs
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a project that we've had for some
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of this social networking site is
connecting entrepreneurs along supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chains so that they're launching entire
supply chains instead of just one business
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of a non-existent local or
regional supply chain, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tough to hang on while you're doing battle
with Walmart, waiting for everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is, well, let's get the
planning going more in cahoots and launch
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has features on there for
entrepreneurs to connect with each other
[SPEAKER_00]: along supply chains, collaborate on their
business plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sneak peek at the next version
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just about to launch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has sections for both the
bloggers who want to share deep thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: about food, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be investors at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have the entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that are really what
the site is about, is helping them develop
[SPEAKER_00]: plans that lead to entire supply chains,
as well as the section that's for economic
[SPEAKER_00]: developers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes their tool that they can use
to support that entrepreneurship,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really is their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But agriculture is a tough place for
economic developers to work, because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about lots and lots of
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're spread out all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one example of one of the supply
chains that was evolving as part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very large dairy farm up in
Ashtabula, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little silvery thing down at the
bottom is not the swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the lagoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you want to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dairy farmer needed a way of
dealing with the stuff in the lagoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his choice, he got involved with
talking about a biodigester with a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Quasar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a biodigester they have on our
campus at OARDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would give him a place to put the
cow manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would generate heat and methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a lot of cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already got heat and methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't care about those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wants to get rid of the manure,
because he needs that to get his siting
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a small vegetable grower
down the road who wanted to site a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse next to the biodigester,
use the heat and methane to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already had a contract with the local
school system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were willing to collect their
food waste and send it back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: biodigester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to combine food waste and
manure, actually, to make the biodigester
[SPEAKER_00]: work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good example, kind of classic
industrial ecology, where that output from
[SPEAKER_00]: one business becomes the input for the
next business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all cycles very efficiently on a
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the kinds of flows that we
had envisioned many years ago as being the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of flows that would lead to healthy
agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure, this never actually
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The negotiations broke down between the
dairy farmer and the biodigester builder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they never could quite get it together
to put all this in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's waiting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you have a biodigester and
know any vegetable growers, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really understand what we've got on
the Ohio landscape, you have to go back in
[SPEAKER_00]: time, like well before we developed the
agro-ecosystem health index, about 1.8
[SPEAKER_00]: million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes you to the end of the
Pleistocene, which is the last time Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: was extensively glaciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that dark area at the top is the
glaciated area of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That river, the Taze River was,
boy that mouse just doesn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here was what paleogeologists say was
the drainage before that ice age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came up from the southern Appalachians arc
through Ohio and then down the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the glaciers did is kind of
bulldozed all of this rich glacial till
[SPEAKER_00]: into those deep river valleys and created
really productive fertile soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also rearranged the drainage so it's
now what you'd recognize the Ohio River
[SPEAKER_00]: going down to the Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to sheepishly admit I don't
remember this from the geology course that
[SPEAKER_00]: I took here, but I think that was the same
time that the Finger Lakes and the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: glacial geologist, you've taken the course
more recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a walk in Robert Treeman
yesterday, and I do remember taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: walk in Robert Treeman with the professor
in that course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hearing all about this in terms of
gorges and Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this is what was happening just
to the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it led to is a real opportunity
for people in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the glacial divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep your eye on the line between the
glaciated and un-glaciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is median household income in
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your eye on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eye on the line again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any question that our wealth
is coming from our soils, that helps me
[SPEAKER_00]: get past that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very fertile, productive soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also leads to a state with a lot of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a Gordon Vegetation Index map,
but I don't expect you to read the legend,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the point is there's a lot of
different kinds of plant communities in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We straddle four EPA ecological zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tremendous amount of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward a few million years to
about 1800, and this is what European
[SPEAKER_00]: settlers are finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Columbus is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ohio River is down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was kind of prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early settlers figured the prairie was
kind of useless because you couldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: grow trees there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they figured out very quickly is
these river valleys were really good for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Ciota River, this little
finger coming down here to the Ohio,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they figured out real quickly you
could grow a lot of corn in those river
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 1800 or 1810.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Ohio frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe two military garrisons along
the Ohio River where you could sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with corn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody got an idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, feed it to cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a guy named William Renwick in 1813
figured out that you could make a tidy
[SPEAKER_00]: profit by producing corn-fed beef and
sending it over the mountains and selling
[SPEAKER_00]: the beef on the international market out
of Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a 1500 head CAFO, confined
animal feeding operation, in Cachactin in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1815 in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else can you do with corn?
Anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, ferment it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were stills all over the Ohio
frontier, not because it was perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: spring break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because that's something you could
do with corn to add value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could turn it into whiskey and put
the whiskey on flat boats and float those
[SPEAKER_00]: down the Ohio River to New Orleans and
sell it on the international market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could also take the brewing
grains and feed that to animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: pigs and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were two distilleries and about
nine breweries in Cincinnati producing,
[SPEAKER_00]: turning the corn into ethanol,
and then taking all those brewery grains
[SPEAKER_00]: and feeding them to pigs, which you could
also chop up and put in barrels with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sell that on the international market
out of New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these quotes about what life was
like in Cincinnati back in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Porkopolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bottom quote is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincinnati originated and perfected the
system that packs 15 bushes of corn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pig and packs the pig into a barrel and
sends them over the mountains and over the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean to feed mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's 1820.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fast forward to about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, that's a statue of a flying
pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those statues all over
Cincinnati.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a College of Biological Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't let that go without addressing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Lord Brabazon of Terra,
the first Lord Brabazon of Terra,
[SPEAKER_00]: who demonstrated in 1909 by strapping a
basket onto the wing of his biplane and
[SPEAKER_00]: then putting a pig in the basket and then
taking off into the sky that pigs do
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back when the ruling class not
only approved of science, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: got involved in it, testing hypotheses
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bystanders tended to say that the pig
didn't seem to have a lot of choice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the pig did fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you see these days if you
look at Ohio from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember the Gordon Vegetation Index
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow all of the things on this long
legend somewhere, but you see five things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that line of where the
glaciers were again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that stuff on the lower right is
grass and trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the upper left, it's corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've added soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we've accomplished in about
200 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still growing a lot of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still feed it to animals in capos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we produce meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sell that on the international
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we produce ethanol for transportation
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one other thing that's changed in
this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those gray spots, that's where people
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not in a situation the settlers
were faced with in the early 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually are some people around that
you could sell stuff to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are starting to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go out, why does it look like
this then?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have all these local markets right
there and you're still producing corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans everywhere, what's the deal here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you talk in the farm community,
there's a lot of focus on we feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we have to do because we feed
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of respect and admiration
for people that are driven by that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to feed somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to feed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data isn't necessarily lining up
with that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look worldwide, it's
approximately one in nine people
[SPEAKER_00]: chronically malnourished with all the
disease and lack of human potential or
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in potential that comes along
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because farmers aren't producing
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are FAO statistics, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at per capita food
availability, about 2,790 kilocalories per
[SPEAKER_00]: person per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's calories, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many calories does it take to
sustain a person for a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,500?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're Michael Phelps, it's a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to do what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that's more than
what it takes to really maintain each
[SPEAKER_00]: person in terms of caloric requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not because there isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because, obviously, it's not getting
to people who need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another interesting statistic is that
people think that this all comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: these really large farms because they're
really efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have really high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out 70% of the supply is still
coming from small farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though large farms have a lot of
the land area, it's not the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the food that's being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of global figures,
the one in nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own it in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most recent census.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now been joined by Maine and Oregon
as northern states with higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: national average household food insecurity
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the census before that, we were the
only one out of the south that had higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than national average food insecurity
rates in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about 16% of households.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one in six of our neighbors
experiencing low food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.6% very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes way up for households with
children, single mothers, people of color,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same kind of categories that are
affected by kind of class issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not the picture of a system
that's sustainable or resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where those low and very low food
security figures come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the darker, the middle shade of blue is
low food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those top three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the stress of not knowing where
your next meal is coming from plus a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the diet, so don't feel like you
can't afford a balanced meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low food security, you start getting
into actually going hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even for low food security,
that's one in six of our neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an impact on what people are
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the hunger and lack of
food that's a food system issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that obesity, type two diabetes,
diet related disease is a huge food
[SPEAKER_00]: security issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that a lot of what's marketed for
children is not great nutritionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually more people that are
experiencing obesity than chronic hunger
[SPEAKER_00]: and malnutrition these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a food system issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current statistics are that a lot of
volunteers for the military are being
[SPEAKER_00]: rejected because they're obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, we're back to having
trouble raising an army.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the US government is starting to pay
attention to this pretty seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have these predictions of
serious food shortages across the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's questionable whether we've even
solved that one problem, but we've
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly that one problem of he who has
no food has only one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: He who has food has many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enough calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the issues that the
Ohio State discovery themes are meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an impact on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three discovery themes are energy
and environment, health and wellness,
[SPEAKER_00]: food production, and security.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at, sometimes they're called
grand challenges, challenge themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come by different names in different
universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not unique to Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find those themes elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the three that our trustees
back in about 2010, several years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: figured were themes that Ohio State had
strengths to resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were willing to put together some
resources into those strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anu tipped you off on the amount that's
being invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this new source of revenue at
Ohio State, and it's because someone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the business office figured out that we're
a university, so why are we screwing
[SPEAKER_00]: around with managing parking lots?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of parking places on
the Columbus campus, about 35,000 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So running the parking lots is kind of a
big effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figure, well, let's lease that to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them do the parking lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll focus on research and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they leased it to a company from
Australia for $485 million over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 years, which is a big slug of new
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone else in the provost's office
said, you know, you should tie that to
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty salaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a decision, because faculty
are revenue generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the route that we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a provost who was also
very willing to make this very bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the very beginning, it's been
faculty, you tell us how you want this to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started with faculty advisory boards and
laying out what are the sub-themes within
[SPEAKER_00]: those big three that we might actually be
able to address at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the cluster analysis,
and they kind of clustered into data
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics, food for health, materials,
and energy, and then infectious diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were calls for proposals in each
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I led a group around climate and the
environment on developing a framework for
[SPEAKER_00]: data analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next round of proposals came
out on these other three themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together with about 50 faculty across
the university, we came up with a proposal
[SPEAKER_00]: for food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going into some of the questions Anu
was asking, this was a result of about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years of reaching out across the
university through the agro-ecosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: management program and developing
relationships with people in other
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges So when we put out the call for
the email, does anybody want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and talk about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had people showing up from many
different colleges that we already were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people in the Department of Art,
the Milton School of Architecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: Glenn School of Public Affairs,
College of Social Work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very diverse group that showed
up on the table and developed this
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal that became InFact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the vision and approach that
we become a worldwide leader in
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptually digital models, but also
practical examples of a transformed food
[SPEAKER_00]: and agriculture that leads to secure,
equitable food security for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we start with the food system that we
own at Ohio State University, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: own one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on who you talk to and which
day, somewhere between $30 and $39 million
[SPEAKER_00]: annual food bill between student dining,
the medical school, all the ways that we
[SPEAKER_00]: procure food at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take collaboration across
the sciences, engineering, and humanities,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as outside of the university with
many partners outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a holistic and transformative
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not tinkering and solving one
problem after the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whack-a-mole game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really is taking a transformative
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does start with the 30 new hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another interesting little side-light
is when we were giving the go-ahead to
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed with InFact, it was a go-ahead on
these 30 hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had proposed that we're going to
start with our own food system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to change our campus
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was putting us in charge of campus
dining or the campus landscapes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since then, just last year,
there was a set of sustainability goals
[SPEAKER_00]: set by the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which was increase the production
and purchase of locally and sustainably
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced food to 40% by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the provost and vice president for
student life commissioned a panel that's
[SPEAKER_00]: now being chaired by myself, our executive
director, the head of dining services,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a student to figure out the action
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually do have our hands on the
Ohio State food system now and can make
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of this initiative, as well as
the kind of research and teaching and
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach that these new faculty colleagues
will be pursuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five main areas where we're doing this
hiring of the 30 hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in climate resilient food
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually not just production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the processing, the
preservation, the distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: the logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that entire food system from the
soil to the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just about changing a
particular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thinking about diversifying that
entire approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kojo Ababio, the guy in the center
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of several people I've met
who just decided, you know, this food
[SPEAKER_00]: system doesn't work for our neighborhood,
so the heck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he started clearing off vacant
lots, getting the Somali youth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood to help with it, producing
collards, African basil, preparing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it in the new Harvest Cafe,
which is behind that mural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of my students trying
to keep up with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very energetic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's about how do we diversify any
given system and across systems of
[SPEAKER_00]: production and the rest of the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a medical and nutritional and
health dimension to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the medical community is embracing this
idea that food is health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a garden that's being
developed by one of my colleagues in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical school, the School of Health and
Rehabilitation Science for cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she's doing is checking the
biometric stats on the cancer survivors
[SPEAKER_00]: that are out there working in the garden,
putting numbers behind this idea that this
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is really good for you to get
involved in this kind of thing and shift
[SPEAKER_00]: your diet and to be working outdoors
producing food and sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the nutrition and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the policy dimension because
policy does shape how our school system or
[SPEAKER_00]: our food system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a site maintained at the Glenn
College of Public Affairs, a colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill Clark, who's done a great job of
holding local food policy councils
[SPEAKER_00]: together in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we had a state food policy council,
haven't had it since the last
[SPEAKER_00]: administration came into power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been pulling together this group
of many local councils into a statewide
[SPEAKER_00]: coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an entrepreneurship and business
opportunity to all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to develop new local and
regional supply chain, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for new businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a study done by the Bush
Consulting Group for the Fund for our
[SPEAKER_00]: Economic Future in Northeast Ohio,
where they identified that both in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of jobs on the left and revenues on the
right, what you could get out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural biosciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's agriculture writ very broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much greater than some of these other
areas like advanced energy, industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: water, flexible electronics that people
were kind of gaga over because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that top part of the bar after the big
thick bar here, that is import
[SPEAKER_00]: substitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically producing in Ohio what
otherwise we would be importing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enormous economic opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So entrepreneurship and business are part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's a capital C in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this food is very basic to our
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this exercise of asking
students, reflect on your experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And invariably, it very quickly gravitates
to special occasions with family,
[SPEAKER_00]: often religious holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cultural dimension to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top left picture is worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different approaches to
food in different cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom picture is actually Columbus,
Columbus Public Health Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very diverse community in
Columbus, Ohio, as well as in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it's what are
these kids experiencing and how are they
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow up thinking about food and
food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the five broad areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the position descriptions or the
position titles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever there's a Buckeye, there's
somebody already hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six of those are already on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody but this one, she arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingrid Adams arrives from Kentucky on
December 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the green circles are searches that
are underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow ones are positions that are
kind of chundering through the approval
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the white ones are the ones that we've
still got a little bit of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deal here is the Office of
Academic Affairs is providing half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: salary for each of these positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half has to come from the
Department of College that that person's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new partnerships being built
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Food, Health, and Human Behavior
is College of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the person's actually tenured in
Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Agroecosystems Management is going to
be shared between the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture and Crop Sciences and Animal
Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had a position shared between
those two units before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are pushing the culture within the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's one of the most
important things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got together as a group of faculty
across ten different colleges and came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely different from the way
it has worked for my entire career at Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been strictly within a
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've checked with our administrators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think this is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last time we got together and
talked about who we were going to hire and
[SPEAKER_00]: why as a faculty across the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, these are not faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are students.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the first graduating
class at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very famous stereoscope
photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the deal where you put the thing
in there and you can look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One out of each eye and it comes to 3D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, but it was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about 1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the first step,
the hiring of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step is weaving the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've actually envisioned the network
that we would expect between departments,
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary programs, external
partners for all 30 of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that inner ring is the 30 new hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those lines, if you can possibly
follow them, is the network that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be interesting to see how the
network actually developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the next real chore for me as
faculty director.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the handbook that's on my desk
these days, the network weaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: June Holly is right down in Athens and is
a real innovator in network weaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you a real quick sample of
one of the projects that's emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm involved in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a linkage and leverage grants
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So linkage is how many people can you
connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leverage is how well can you use it as a
seed for new resources coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are on our website, which you'll
see in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the food mapping team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a study in the Gulf Coast counties
of Mississippi where we looked at what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost of a representative low cost
balanced diet, the USDA thrifty food plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a function of where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the cost of all the items in the
USDA plan, as well as the cost of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: around to round it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changes as a function of where
you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a twofold difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a car, it's about a
fourfold difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this because I've never really
liked this idea of food deserts,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a line here and it's a food
desert there and it's not over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these places where it's a very
gradual transition in the increasing cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point is that we say very blithely
food is cheap in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on where you live and who
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real interesting part that we're
going to repeat the study in Columbus to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at this is what's the median income
for people in those areas that are in red
[SPEAKER_00]: and how big a percentage of their income
is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other project that we're working on in
addition to doing that food scape in
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus is new faculty hire in the data
analytics initiative who's doing an agent
[SPEAKER_00]: based model of how people actually respond
to that landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have colleagues in the medical
school who can get from diet to what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're talking about the answer is a
new grocery store somewhere or a new bus
[SPEAKER_00]: line somewhere, you have a way of
predicting who is that going to help and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much and what's the health outcome
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a flavor of the kind of research
that we're pulling people together to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've hired Brian Snyder as our executive
director.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I better stop there and take some
questions if there are any.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm around tomorrow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be glad to get together with you
and pursue this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Columbus, where your main campus is
located, the Franklin Park Conservatory
[SPEAKER_01]: has been running the Growing to Green
program to encourage the establishment of
[SPEAKER_01]: community gardens, especially in
under-resourced communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will your program have any relationship
with that Growing to Green?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Growing to Green, with Mid-Ohio Food
Bank, Children's Hunger Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus Public Health, there are quite a
few partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really the ones that can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pending proposal that will allow
us to take this new purchasing that Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: State is willing to do and direct it at
the community and get people help in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help with their family
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not worried about whether it's
full-time or part-time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part-time is actually just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do that, those folks are going to
need a lot of support, training,
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tremendous number of community
workers that can help with that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talk about agricultural
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transformation, we can help encourage it
from the university, the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the transformation happens outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the exception of the one with the
food system that we do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're starting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have questions up in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we have a tradition to do it this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't necessarily get to raise their hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your vision of Ohio State 20,
50 years down the line with the food
[SPEAKER_01]: system?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my graduate school advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right back to the exam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tony asked, what's my vision for the
food system programs in Ohio State 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years down the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see this initiative grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's an expectation that it
becomes part of the formal structure at
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more important to me is that it
becomes part of the culture at Ohio State
[SPEAKER_00]: that we continue this tradition of getting
together across colleges to talk about who
[SPEAKER_00]: we hire, why, and how we can progress on
some of these really big challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also how we partner with the people
outside the university who are really the
[SPEAKER_00]: agents of change out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the hurdles you'd get for that
vision?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the hurdles both domestically and
internationally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say the hurdles are many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would be in each of those five
dimensions that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are hurdles that have to do with
how do you gain new economies in
[SPEAKER_00]: production, not just economy of scale,
but economy of scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like we have a strong group in
precision agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you take that technology and
make it scale independent so it's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers across any different scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of the kind of research that
would be needed to get to that vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's I think hurdles there,
hurdles in the health fields, policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the business and entrepreneurship,
and how the private sector engages with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it that we have 16% low household
food security in Ohio and nobody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and nobody's out screaming and
demonstrating in the streets about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a cultural dimension and a
cultural hurdle to overcome on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: both here and internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey, I'm really intrigued by the vision
department.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you engage them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how were they brought into the fold?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are they changing the way you're
looking at these questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been working with folks in
landscape architecture and city and
[SPEAKER_00]: regional planning, which is also in the
School of Architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those folks are very interested in
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you plan for an improved food
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Designers tend to look at these things in
a very holistic way, but a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different holistic way than I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already gained something from talking
to landscape architecture or live
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape architects and how they're
designing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they design around very similar
principles to what we're talking about in
[SPEAKER_00]: designing agricultural production
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're building in the ecological
and economic and social dimensions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: design and needing to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a design charrette last week in
landscape architecture on adaptive
[SPEAKER_00]: agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of our new hires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Forbes Lipschitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came from LSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's featured this month on the cover of
Landscape Architecture magazine for work
[SPEAKER_00]: she was doing in the catfish farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she works at these very broad,
agroecosystem scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is interested in visualizing what new
agroecosystems might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do they look like now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where are the opportunities to search
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this design charrette, I asked in the
middle of it, have you guys all had
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're really doing a good job of
bringing those principles in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them actually have not had a
course in ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes the reading that they have
to catch up on very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an example where we have
something to contribute to what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very quick to reach out to us to
help, especially with that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also come up with these
ideas and visions and ways of visualizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it that are not in our skill set.
Thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
