[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Heather Garvey is a soils and
economics specialist for UBM Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heather is involved with implementing
research and outreach programs in the area
[SPEAKER_01]: of fuel, forage, and grain production
systems in New England.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her outreach focuses on delivering on-farm
education in the areas of soil health,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient management, organic grain,
and forage production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research is focused on traditional and
niche crop variety trials weed management
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies, and cropping systems
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say that this is not the first
time Heather is presented here.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's presented at NYCLE meetings in the
past and also runs the Vermont Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Grains Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar type of conference to this,
maybe larger and some different people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I encourage you to check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've not been out there before,
I was there last year and had a great
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please help me welcome Dr. Heather
Garvey.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has been a renewed interest in
growing oil seeds again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say renewed because like a decade,
15 years ago, we had a very strong
[SPEAKER_03]: interest in oil seed production,
but primarily focused on producing
[SPEAKER_03]: biofuels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had many, many projects for,
again, for about 10 years, focused on
[SPEAKER_03]: figuring out if we could produce fuel on
our farms from field to field.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great one-liner there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we worked with farmers all over
Vermont to set up infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_03]: oil presses, biofuel reactors.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to have the university get out
and worked up about something on your per
[SPEAKER_03]: card, purchase a reactor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a time when diesel fuel prices
had gone up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were over $5 a gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that happens, naturally people are
interested in figuring out how to cut
[SPEAKER_03]: costs and do things on their own,
like farmers like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we spent, again, a decade trying to
figure out all the different pieces of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing your own fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if these slides look like they're
from 15 years ago, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if it's not any
PPTS.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how old it is that everybody knows
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to update them a little bit,
but it's hard to make me look 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: older.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of our oil seed work focused on
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's, again, another strong
interest that I heard here about growing
[SPEAKER_03]: sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can tell you all the things not to
do, which I think is probably the most
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also done a lot of work with canola.
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to do a lot of work with
winter canola.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, I can also tell you all the
things not to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to be successful,
I can tell you how to do that,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a ton of time, years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also did a lot of work with flax,
which is on my top 10 list of crops that I
[SPEAKER_03]: hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones include hampa and hops.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, what's that other one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Canola, penny grass, a few others that I
kind of get in that list.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to grow and be successful
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Peter Robinson calls you for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you love flax?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is extremely hard to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of things that I just
like about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hemp, we've done a lot of work
with that for grain as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a whole number of oil seed
crops out there that you can grow that can
[SPEAKER_03]: be grown here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soybeans, I didn't even put that one up
here, but soybeans don't produce much oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're trying to get gallons per
acre, soybeans aren't the crop to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're trying to market the oil
itself from a culinary perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's also not really that popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the number one oil seed that we've
worked with that people have been really
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in from a culinary perspective
is sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus they're really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes people smile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it builds relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes your neighbors happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people that drive by are happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow a sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how happy it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy I'm just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see the pictures of sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to focus on growing
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really appropriate crop for
organic production.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does take a good amount of fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also really good at getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good crop in a rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty darn weak competitive once
it gets out of the gangly teenager stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to be as wimpy as corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're combining it, you,
unless it's really, they're above most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're just taking off that yellow
part there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not trying to get it down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can, the crop itself can accept
quite a bit of weeds and still be
[SPEAKER_03]: successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that didn't offend anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about seed sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed industry itself, as everybody
knows, has consolidated a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that includes the sunflower seed
availability and industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be at least one variety of
certified organic oil seeds that was
[SPEAKER_03]: available back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The defender was used to carry it through
Lakeview.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I know, if someone is buying
certified organic seed somewhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, for commercially
available sunflower oil seed genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to have to work with one of
these companies to get untreated seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: New seed has always been really good to us
as far as having seed that wasn't treated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody has used them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to be seeds 2,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's new seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus the names of their varieties are
so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Camaro, Defender, Cobra, Badger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are still in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They carry a wide range of maturities and
options and resistance to disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're a great company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will work with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they did with me even just a year
ago on getting untreated seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you really need to get a hold of them
pretty early on in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people know with the war in
Ukraine and Ukraine's a big producer of
[SPEAKER_03]: sunflowers, there was sunflower shortage,
and then a lot of people started growing
[SPEAKER_03]: sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then there also was a seed,
I won't say shortage, but they were
[SPEAKER_03]: selling out pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cropland Genetics always had a lot of
really good varieties, again, that fit
[SPEAKER_03]: into our season here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course you have Micogen and
Pioneer or Vermont.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually especially Vermont.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you can get untreated
seed from them, but they're owned by a
[SPEAKER_03]: French company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a big sunflower division as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what maturity should you be growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all sit really well with early to
mid-maturing varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for most people, I would definitely
stay with the mid-maturing variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you why in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The later varieties definitely can yield a
bit more, but it can be exceptionally
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to get them dry to harvest in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to get them out of the field
actually in September, I would say is
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty advisable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get into October, the weather,
it's unpredictable anyway, but just the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of moisture that we get and the
amount of actual drying time decreases a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes it difficult to harvest or
get the crop harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you're buying seed,
one of the things to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: besides maturity is the size of the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can buy size two, size three,
or size four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can buy size five,
but it does go up to size 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about a sunflower head,
you got the biggest seeds on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you go into the middle,
the seeds get smaller and smaller and
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes there's not even viable seed
in the middle of the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when those get harvested for seed
production, they're graded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bigger twos, threes, and fours are
what are kept for seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So size two is the biggest, and then it
goes down in size, and size four is
[SPEAKER_03]: smallest.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people would say, well,
size two, there's more bigger,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to come out of the ground
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot less size two available to
buy, and there's a lot more size four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think size fours were fine,
but the big thing here is that you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: part planter or some kind of planter that
can handle whatever seed size you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and I'll talk about that more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the whole presentation, I just want
you to know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you plant the sunflowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you should wait until the ground's
50 degrees, just like corn, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the warmer the ground is, the faster
the seed's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since you're not using treated seed,
I would suggest that you wait,
[SPEAKER_03]: ideally for us, the first full week of
June was always the best time to plant the
[SPEAKER_03]: sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily always the best weather,
but it helped us avoid burn damage,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it also helped us avoid the abandoned
sunflowers, which are the two of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest issues that we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it wasn't really the fact that we
couldn't plant earlier, but planting
[SPEAKER_03]: during that week in June helped us avoid
two of the major pest issues that will be
[SPEAKER_03]: problems for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The birds will be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will eat all of your research
plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the farmers that I've worked
with that have grown oilseeds said,
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out how much they'll eat,
and plant that much for the birds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then plant your crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can plant with a regular corn
planter, all different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're using an old finger pick-up
type, you're going to want to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds will get picked up by the
fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using a vacuum type and you have
different discs, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure you get a sunflower disc.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed are really, you can squish them,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can break them pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about putting that seed through a
planter and how easily it can get damaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once it's damaged, it's hard for it to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to get really good
populations, you need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: you have your planter set up properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The right amount of vacuum, the right
plates, the right finger pick-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of us learned that the
hard way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed was coming out, it was going in the
ground, but apparently we were damaging a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of it, and we were ending up with
really bad stands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something to consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as seeding rate goes, everybody
will argue with me about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably nobody here, but to our audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have trouble getting stands,
and I think some of that had to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: the planter, maybe sometimes the
conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We generally were planting at 37,000 seeds
per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you go online and you look at the
Manitoba website or North Dakota or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot, they'll say anywhere from like 15
to 20,000 seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a denser thinner, first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really, but it's dry,
so it's a lot of dry land farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a lot of moisture, and I'll talk
about what happens when you have low
[SPEAKER_03]: stands and a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can have higher stands, and I think
your final population should be around 25
[SPEAKER_03]: to probably 28,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get that final population,
especially as you're dialing in on your
[SPEAKER_03]: planting process, whatever planter you
have, you should probably see around
[SPEAKER_03]: 30,000, maybe a little more per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to kind of dial things in,
but your final population, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: can be quite a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as fertility goes, it's somewhat
similar to corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs a very similar amount of
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's really efficient at nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a really, really deep taproot that
can pull up nutrients from a much
[SPEAKER_03]: different depth than corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'll show you some slides about
over-fertilizing sunflowers and what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, in organic farming,
something you need to think about,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially what crop you're gonna follow
the sunflowers with, because you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to add too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll kill your crop, and I'll show you
some evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get moving through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seed size and planter type,
I talked about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of stuff, different planters
you can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most anything really will work if you're
focused on planting the sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's just a picture of a corn planter
with fingers, what the sunflowers do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the corn fingers look like versus the
corn fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, about seed size, number of seeds
per pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our seeds are expensive,
and I don't know how much, have you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: bought some?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what my last bag was,
but it's not as expensive as corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about 400.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a bag, size fours, should have 225,000
seeds in a bag, roughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give or take 224,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're planting 20,000 seeds per acre,
you can get quite a few acres out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So planting more seed, you're gonna get
less acres, so it'll add to the cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: production, but until you kind of get
moving through and figuring it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: stay with a slightly higher population.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great table.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the North Dakota site that
really talks about seed sizes,
[SPEAKER_03]: planter types, vacuum pressure,
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is available online to kind of
help you get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does list quite a few different types
of planters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very useful document.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can send it to folks if you can't find
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing sunflowers, mostly folks
in organic rotation, they rotate well
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway, and they have diverse rotations,
but it is not even advisable to grow two
[SPEAKER_03]: years of sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell you firsthand that you
will see yield decline in the second year
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's without Minnesota conventional
production, but you just, you gotta
[SPEAKER_03]: rotate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rotation shouldn't be long,
like six years minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna get a lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as yields go, the best yields we've
ever seen were 5,000 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, some years are good, some years are
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 2,000 pounds is not unheard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally you would get two to 3,000
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see varieties seem different
depending on the maturity and the variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the list plans we have per acre
is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We say myocytosis as an example,
but what we found was that we would end up
[SPEAKER_03]: with these ginormous sunflower heads,
like not that big, but pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we have a lot of moisture,
we also have a lot of fertility in our
[SPEAKER_03]: soils, which is different than a lot of
places that grow sunflower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would end up with these humongous
plants, which sounds great, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The yield should be the same, the head's
three times the size, less cost,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was virtually impossible to get
those dried down enough to actually put
[SPEAKER_03]: them through the column.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've ever taken a sunflower head
and broken it in half, it's like a sponge
[SPEAKER_03]: in the middle, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what sponges do when it rains or when
they get wet?
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck up a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we just, A, those huge heads,
we could never get them dried down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then if it was wet and it was late,
they would just hold so much moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if the seed was dry enough,
the harvest and the plant is mature,
[SPEAKER_03]: that spongy part takes forever to dry
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bigger it is, the longer it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we actually found that by
increasing the populations and having
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller plants and smaller heads,
it dried down a lot faster and made
[SPEAKER_03]: harvesting that much easier and more
uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have the plants at the end of the
field, that they're huge, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: semi-truss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you put your combine in there and it
grows up trying to get that sunflower head
[SPEAKER_03]: through the combine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an appropriate noise for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you say happened here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm driving to the research lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighbors, yeah, they had a wedding
and they wanted sunflowers for their
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter's wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination of things, but the
primary thing, this was a nitrogen study.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, my scientific
background led me to believe that there
[SPEAKER_03]: was too much nitrogen and the plants
launched.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got really tall and launched.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all launched.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen not just at this site,
this is a little bit of a shocker,
[SPEAKER_03]: but seen on farms, you see them patches on
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so too much nitrogen is not a good
thing with this crop at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very efficient at taking up
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always seem to get better yields on our
research farms where we had a long history
[SPEAKER_03]: of dairy manure applications when we just
didn't find anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could definitely go a year in
sunflowers without fertilizing with any
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen and usually get really good
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you have to understand what
your background nitrogen is because if you
[SPEAKER_03]: open any book from anywhere else,
it'll tell you sunflowers need between 100
[SPEAKER_03]: and 200 pounds of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get 2,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need at least 100 pounds of actual end
going into that plant, which could mean
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to put on 150 pounds or maybe
even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hard for us to get a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were launching all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just stopped actually putting
nitrogen on when we were going into fields
[SPEAKER_03]: that were had a good amount of fertility
on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would see a response from nitrogen when
we were on more depleted soils,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we would barely see a response
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that they require a lot of
nitrogen, but they're also very efficient
[SPEAKER_03]: at taking it up and digging deep into the
soil profile for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, when we did studies,
this was on sand, we would see a response
[SPEAKER_03]: at about a 90 pound rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason we would see often lower
yields at higher rates is that we would
[SPEAKER_03]: see washing, not because it wasn't
enhancing yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as weed control goes,
the sunflowers responded well to time
[SPEAKER_03]: weeding and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time weeding worked really well to control
weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does with anything as long as you hit
the timing right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we time weeded a little too much,
sometimes we'd reduce the populations,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like six days after planting
and 12 days after planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could reduce the population and see
some issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we also without any weed
control could see good yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is more weed competitive than a crop
like corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that has to do with its ability to
scavenge nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growing in a different part of the
soil profile than many other weeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a pretty resilient crop in that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the average rooting depth of
sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of work with interseeding
into sunflowers as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually work better in
interseeding systems, way better than
[SPEAKER_03]: corn, because the canopy isn't quite as
thick and it opens up a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: than corn does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had really good luck interseeding
cover crops into sunflowers a lot better
[SPEAKER_03]: than we did in the corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest disease issue that we started
to run into was white mold, sclerotinia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, rotation is key for any of the
diseases that a sunflower gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also gets a lot of downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to select resistant varieties
of white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: White mold is an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're growing other broadleafs,
that's something to think about in your
[SPEAKER_03]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this happens in other
crops, but the scary thing about white
[SPEAKER_03]: mold and sunflowers is that it can
actually travel plant to plant through the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just see whole rows going down
from white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: From one infection point on one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of the primary reasons why
you want to be really careful if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to grow this crop and how close it
is to other white mold sensitive crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is basically broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you start to see white
mold, be very cautious because it can
[SPEAKER_03]: spread this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen that in other crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banded sunflower moth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was our primary pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got so bad in some years that we
couldn't figure out why we weren't getting
[SPEAKER_03]: any yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't see any bird damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were combining what we needed to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could hear coming out of the heads
what was all blowing out of the back of
[SPEAKER_03]: the combine because this nasty little
larvae had eaten all the middle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in years when it was really bad,
it heavily impacted yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the best way that we found to
manage this is by delaying the planting
[SPEAKER_03]: date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from a picture up north.
[SPEAKER_03]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously the more birds you have,
the less yield you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant some for the birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of work trying to find the
right shaped head for the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We read a lot about some varieties their
heads fold down when they dry and some
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties cut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some varieties are faced up and some
varieties drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought, well, we'll find the
variety that's resistant to birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it cups up, it becomes a bird bath.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it fills with water and then they
stand on the edge and they take a drink
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they put their body in their
beaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take over the edge and back the seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go to the sunflower and it's
full of bird seeds and water and poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was faced up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selecting variety was really that useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seemed like they were pretty much
all just susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we did find was, again,
delaying the planting date till that first
[SPEAKER_03]: full week in June really helped us avoid
bird damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, when the red-winged
blackbirds flocked up, you either don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want the seed ready at that point or you
want it already out of the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some nitrogen issues lodging in
deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a lot of deer, they will just
bite the head right off before you even
[SPEAKER_03]: see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just something to think about.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: In places where they harvest sunflowers,
they have these things called sunflower
[SPEAKER_03]: pans or sunflower head, which we didn't
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you try to harvest them without
this, you'll lose quite a bit of yield
[SPEAKER_03]: because the heads come off and then they
bounce out when you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're bouncing back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pans just kind of catch the heads
as you're cutting them off and then bring
[SPEAKER_03]: them into the combine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the farm that we worked with on these
projects, they built their own out of
[SPEAKER_03]: plywood and plastic and whatever they had
on the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could build them on your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we built some for the combine
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bolted them on and off.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I think I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to go down to the oil
processing part because.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know when I want to make them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've done work in all the other oil
seeds, too, and I'm happy to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know people were interested in oil
processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of this is on my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did bring a few copies of some of
the booklets on small scale oil
[SPEAKER_03]: processing, oil seed information about the
presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all still relevant today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if all these models are
still available or not, but they're listed
[SPEAKER_03]: there and those are all the ones we
trialed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on average, we would get 70 gallons of
sunflower oil per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're wondering what your yield of
oil would be, you can plan between 50 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 75 gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the different presses that we've
used and operated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all available on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ag oil press has 70 gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can still get these.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were the only American made press.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were manufactured in Wisconsin and
all the presses that ended up being the
[SPEAKER_03]: best one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Largest soap of what you can actually
press with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what all the these were all screw
presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all operate basically in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you put the seed in and it extrudes it
through that barrel under pressure and
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the oil comes out and the meal comes
out the other end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, we evaluated all of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, those costs are from 14 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they cost a lot more now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably double what I imagine,
if not more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all that information is in the report,
in the capacity, what you can adjust on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And more information about how much
capacity they could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them were meant to do about a
thousand to two thousand pounds a day of
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see this is our capacity that
we documented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's just a couple of pictures of the
presses and the meal coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of work with the Chinese
presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had to mess around with them a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't very automated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were hard to adjust, but they were
cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the time I was $1500 for that
big mega, mega, mega press.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the dials or buttons worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to get it running once we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that Ag oil press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the best service.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that could work with you call.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the percent oil we're getting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we're getting anywhere from
basically 30 or 40 percent oil out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moisture content is really important when
you're pressing seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know it's important when you're
storing seed, but you actually want the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed pretty dry, not too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want it too wet to get the
moist, the most oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually we were starting around seven
percent moisture, eight percent moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have too much moisture,
which can be like 10 percent, you just
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see the meal will start coming
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be getting any oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's too dry, you know,
you'll hear the whole press on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to squeeze the seed through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also won't get any oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moisture content is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so last piece about culinary oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of people interested in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially at the end of our project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you buy oil in a store,
it's almost the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same color, more or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it all pretty much tastes the same
except for maybe olive oil and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: your kind of finer high end oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because they're refined,
they're bleached and they're deodorized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they look the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have no color and they taste like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually can do most of these on a
small scale if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of figured out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I doubt that's the market people want
to get into.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really the biggest thing that people
need to do after you press the oil is to
[SPEAKER_03]: filter it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you can do that just by letting
it sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the gunk goes to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can buy like simple stock filters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can use things that are more
complex like a filter press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like you put cider through other
food products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the filtering just gets out of the gunk
and it can take out some of the fossil
[SPEAKER_03]: lipids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes it a slightly cleaner product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are trying to do any high oil,
a high heat cooking, you definitely want
[SPEAKER_03]: to try to have a finer filtration process
to get out some of those fossil lipids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just using it to make salad
dressings and maybe doing a little baking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just let it settle and it'll be
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shelf life of unrefined oils we found
to be much better than commercial oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is accelerated shelf life studies
that we did with Penn State back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because you're not taking all the good
stuff out of the oil, then it actually has
[SPEAKER_03]: a longer shelf life because there's more
antioxidants and things like that left in
[SPEAKER_03]: the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that the oil actually could
last several years without changing taste
[SPEAKER_03]: or really color.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as censoring consumer testing,
we did a little bit of this as well with
[SPEAKER_03]: Penn State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made Italian dressing out of it and put it
in front of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really meant to be the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be very similar to commercial
oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, it still tastes
like the point because you haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: bleached it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't deodorized it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're producing sunflower oil,
it's going to taste like sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you bake with it, we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good taste if you're standing there in
peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did convert tractors over to run off
from straight vegetable oil, which worked
[SPEAKER_03]: really well this summer time, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: In itself, we had one tractor that could
run just off from the vegetable oil we
[SPEAKER_03]: were producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also got into making biodiesel on
many different scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our largest scale down in
southern Vermont to the smallest scale,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was this little compact unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we used on the research farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We produced all the diesel fuel that we
needed for the further research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little gas pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put the ingredients there on the
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: These buttons worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you waited for 24 hours to get
the gas pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are a lot of ways that we
tried to make diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could actually make ASTM-grade fuel
at our larger facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 100% possible to grow your own
fuel, make it on your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this was 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these were the different farms making
fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was costing people anywhere from
$0.98 to $3 a gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You woke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: $2.98?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was five, they sold gas for a
nickel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people were really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Marketville, they were at the
largest scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had more efficiencies on their
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The research farm, that's Roger.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was producing fuel for about $3.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was with that smaller system that I
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing it very cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say, don't use it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so one of the benefits was to
get the meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about this pellet meal
last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got this out of China.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big China shopping spree one
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of it's in the hedgerows right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we got everything that we could get in
a box on a ship for $25.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this pellet meal cost like $250.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you can make briquettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make briquettes with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make all different size pellets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting this meal, which is
another product of growing the oilseed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we pelletized everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on somebody this last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the meal itself is a really valuable
resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very high in protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know that soy meal,
soybean meal, canola meal, these
[SPEAKER_03]: byproducts are fed in the livestock
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was really exciting to people in
the project because most of them were
[SPEAKER_03]: livestock growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The downside was that our oilseed meal
still had a lot of oil in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you commercially extract oil as a
seed, they usually use hexane to get out
[SPEAKER_03]: the last driplets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly, we're not using hexane,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a lot of oil left in that meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gave the meal really high fat
content, which limited the amount of meal
[SPEAKER_03]: that we could feed to a hermit because it
would upset the whole process in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: too much fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did do a feeding trial and kind of
looked at all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we ended up doing was looking at
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a fertility source, a really good
organic fertility source, between four and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half and six percent nitrogen is pretty
high for most organic fertility sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were putting it back on the land
and using it primarily as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did see in some of our studies when we
were using canola and mustard meal that it
[SPEAKER_03]: actually suppressed the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some is good, too much is too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I killed the weeds to get them or nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of nitrogen in those
meals and we could definitely fertilize
[SPEAKER_03]: the corn crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: By putting the meal back on the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also burn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use it as a fuel source because
there's still a lot of oil in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we pelletized it and put it in a pellet
stove and heated the shop with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times are back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an exciting time again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can grow your own fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the power.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like who's in the loop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growing the oil seed,
the farmer pressing the oil, selling the
[SPEAKER_03]: virgin oil as a value added product and
then getting the waste vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegetable oil back to be made into
biodiesel back on the farm using the meal
[SPEAKER_03]: to feed the animals or feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, well, interestingly enough,
the administration changed and the money
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were getting to do this project
and the focus on the project just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The website is all there still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have time for one question or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need time to.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got rid of the Chinese press.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of lead paint on it was really.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did test that dangerously
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're scared to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the oil content could be influenced by
any number of environmental factors we saw
[SPEAKER_03]: that if there was too much nitrogen,
the oil content would be low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found, you know, depending on the
variety, the oil content could be low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wonder if in that case,
because it was pretty consistent for us
[SPEAKER_03]: with the exception of the winter content
of the actual seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many hours did it take?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hours per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hours per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's in the booklet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice there's a whole like the little
economic analysis I showed you if you go
[SPEAKER_03]: to the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still download all of all of that
information, but also run your own
[SPEAKER_03]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know how many hours were
gathered a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's interesting because when we
first started thinking about this,
[SPEAKER_03]: we knew that it would take acres,
obviously, to make your own fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would that kind of pencil out at the
end of the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would we always talked about,
oh, well, my grandfather used that forces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had to set aside so much land to
feed his horses so that he had power to
[SPEAKER_03]: run his farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we we all started talking about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how many acres would it take to
actually fuel our farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: But so there's a lot to consider,
obviously, in that problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethanol.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a problem that we were
starting to have to deal with was the
[SPEAKER_03]: winds that was being produced,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You had glycerin and some other waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what were we going to do with
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually process it and clean
it to get the methanol out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm only telling you part of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
You.
