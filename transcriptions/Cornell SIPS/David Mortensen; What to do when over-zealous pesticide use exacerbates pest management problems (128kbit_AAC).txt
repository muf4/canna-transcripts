[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further ado, let's welcome Dave
Mortenson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the nice warm welcome and
the very nice attendance today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real pleasure for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time I've had the
opportunity to speak at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a New Yorker and a long time ago I
actually applied to study graduate school
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also have relatives in Ithaca,
so it's really nice to be here amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: colleague friends and former students of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a joy for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just back on the heels of a sabbatical
leave, so getting back into the groove
[SPEAKER_00]: down at Penn State and the seminar that I
put together today kind of tells a story
[SPEAKER_00]: about some things that have been engaged
in over the last 10 years or so from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of have woven several pieces of
that story together in a way that I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: will be interesting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really stimulating discussion
yesterday morning for two hours about
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological slash sustainable
intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I've been thinking a
lot about on the heels of the paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had come out last week in Bioscience,
where we have been sort of stepping back
[SPEAKER_00]: and asking questions about what we're
assuming about intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: For about a month of time that I spent in
Wageningen in September, I was intrigued
[SPEAKER_00]: with the notion that the Dutch used for
describing an agricultural system that is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of entrenched or locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it struck me that the system that I've
been working in is very much locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you about what locked in
means and what the consequences of lock in
[SPEAKER_00]: are with respect to pest management And
sometimes when I've given this seminar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had folks come up to me and say,
that was rather dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I was invited to speak in Lyon
when I was in Europe in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had several young people come up and
say, wow, that was kind of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lock in part was dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've added a third piece to this,
which is a bright third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will try to convey, actually,
my enthusiasm about the path forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: the brightness that I see on that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the paper that I referred to,
one of the bright young minds in my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch Hunter, took the lead on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a subject that we started about
four years ago in discussion in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of took about two years to
become clear what we were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing and debating in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took a critical look at,
we didn't run the models, but we were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually assessing model output.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mantra that we've been hearing,
really, for about the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: been adopted as the argument by de Grande.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the data from the
Academy Society of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it as soon as you open the
splash page of Monsanto's website and lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of other places that are talking about ag
production that we need to double yield by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assumption, then, and I feel quite
strongly that this is an implied
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption, is that we must ramp up
intensification of production to meet this
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you take a critical look at the
doubling data, it's actually not doubling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like somewhere between 30 and 50
or so percent increases in yields from
[SPEAKER_00]: today going forward to 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would argue strongly that it will
not require intensification to pull this
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not even looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, we had, in this great
discussion, there were really thoughtful
[SPEAKER_00]: comments and questions and observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Cornell political forum that I
spoke in on Tuesday evening, all
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate students, really thoughtful
comments about waste, food waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtful comments about human diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that's even touched in this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just simply saying, what is the food
demand from here going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being overstated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that food production
doesn't need to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a lot of blowback on this the
day the paper came out on Wednesday of
[SPEAKER_00]: last week about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying that, but we're saying
it's not the increase that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been sort of basing assumptions on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've probably all seen these beautiful
graphics of Jonathan Foley from the
[SPEAKER_00]: science paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see several floral plots or
spider plots in the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a presentation from some of the
data that we've been collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cultivated planet papers of
Jonathan's and other papers, he argues
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's going to be important for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a natural system, long flower
petals, lots of ecosystem services
[SPEAKER_00]: provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water quality regulation, water flow,
preserving habitats for biodiversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: He argues that in the most extreme case,
intensification focuses almost exclusively
[SPEAKER_00]: on production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We maximize the floral plot on production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not paying attention to the
other ecosystem services, not near enough
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the other ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he argues then is that I keep
going to that screen, but he argues that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be paying attention to a fuller
suite of these services as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more or less what we're arguing
in this bioscience paper as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This argument of Foley's, I would argue,
really needs to be conceived of with the
[SPEAKER_00]: backdrop of the reality of what
intensification looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked out in Nebraska for 15 years
before coming back east.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have this kind of large agriculture
down in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the Midwest, for sure, it's like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's what we think of then as a
suite of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could imagine this,
we spent the better part of three hours in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wageningen one morning debating whether
it's a syndrome, which has a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: connotation, or it's a cluster of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, they go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger fields, reduced crop diversity,
larger farms, increased reliance on
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and fertilizers, increased
reliance on genetically modified crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer people, depopulation in rural
communities is a syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really necessarily mean that
it has to be negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't know that I think of
syndrome as such a negative term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, clusters, whatever we want to
call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tony and I and Chuck and other folks
that do pest management, where we spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time with weedy plants,
over the last 20 or so years, maybe 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: have watched something unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the advent of
herbicide-resistant crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about them coming in the
mid-'80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first ones were commercialized in
1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glyphosate Roundup Ready crops came on the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans was the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then corn and cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back to the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent a lot of time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the literature is replete with we will
significantly reduce pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, actually, there are some
things that we'll talk about eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the herbicide is so effective that
within two or three years, the populations
[SPEAKER_00]: will have declined to a point where we
would have no weed infestations in corn
[SPEAKER_00]: and soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually citations claiming
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the first plants evolved resistance
to this practice, which started to appear
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1999 and 2000, so three years after the
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's after papers had been written
and published in peer-reviewed literature
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1997 that claimed it was very hard to
conceive of any plants evolving resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to this herbicide, given how hard it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: To transform the soybean and corn to be
resistant to glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the first species were observed,
people said that that's a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not economically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can manage for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we have 28 species resistant,
infesting 24 million hectares of arable
[SPEAKER_00]: cropland in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on which grant panel you
work with, and I had the good fortune of
[SPEAKER_00]: chairing one recently in DC in January,
some of our whole research programs have
[SPEAKER_00]: been co-opted to address the resistance
problem that has been created by this
[SPEAKER_00]: management breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, the herbicides that the
crop plants are selected to be resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to, the use of those have increased
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light blue is glyphosate use on this
axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dark blue is the adoption curve of
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 plus percent of the acres are being
planted in soybean in this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is interesting, because this is
something that some people would claim
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a debate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the facts actually are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide use, which when we're thinking
pesticides, insecticides, fungicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides are pesticides, pesticide use
has increased by about 110 million pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of active ingredient in the time since
genetically modified crops are introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that increase is coming on the
back of weed pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: With about a 20 million pound reduction in
insecticide use of synthetic insecticides
[SPEAKER_00]: applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colleagues of mine in entomology at Penn
State, Maggie Douglas has done some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing work on this, and John Tooker,
have been looking at the toxicity profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of the insecticide use pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, given the seed treatments
that are being used, and depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: target organism, in their case,
they're looking very closely at bees and
[SPEAKER_00]: wild pollinators, the toxicity profile of
insecticides has increased by about half,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, what it was pre-GMO for the
pollinator community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the neonicotinoid insecticide use
in soybean and corn in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all a package that goes
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We engineer the crop plant to be resistant
to the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost always it has Bt traits in it as
well for insect tolerance or resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the seeds are coated with a seed
treatment with fungicides and
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides, usually three to five
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the resistance cranking along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you can see why people say
this is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell a dark story, but it does get
brighter in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance, and Tony was saying that I
have entered into talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: science in Washington DC, and I have done
things like congressional testimony,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something like 10 congressional
briefings, meetings with the Secretary of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and the head of the EPA on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last three or four years,
because one of the solutions to this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, the agro ecologists in the room
are thinking, gosh, there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we could be doing to address
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the private sector interest,
the way to address this problem or the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that was explored is to insert additional
genes into the crop genome that confer
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to other herbicide active
ingredients, while also keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate gene in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would continue to use glyphosate,
and then you would use other herbicides to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up the resistant ones and clean up
the weed problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a 2012 paper that your own Matt Ryan
and I and several other folks wrote,
[SPEAKER_00]: our so-called critical juncture paper,
we were looking at these herbicide use
[SPEAKER_00]: trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is total herbicide use, and we were
doing a lot of our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also a lab discussion thing that
evolved into a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 2012 when our paper came out,
but we basically really didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the Bush administration,
we stopped collecting herbicide use data
[SPEAKER_00]: for about six years, and so there's a gap
in data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting, actually,
if we were to go back and revise this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd now have some data that Maggie
Douglas was able to dig out of these data
[SPEAKER_00]: files that the NRCS collects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, and then if we put the
genes for these other herbicides into the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop genome, what we were predicting was
going to happen is that total herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: use and then use of other herbicides was
going to increase a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very conservative on the low
end, and then we were projecting kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: high end adoption of these herbicides,
and then the total herbicide use would be
[SPEAKER_00]: heading up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw from Maggie's data, she already
has us up through 2014 where this line is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually something up here, and that's
real data since our paper came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a dramatic increase in herbicide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of the pesticides used in commodity
crop production are herbicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a dramatic increase in the use of these
things is a big number, and it's cause for
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we argue that the critical juncture
then was let's really step back and think
[SPEAKER_00]: about whether we want to be doing this
stacked trait, multiple trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide resistance business that we then
said, we'll create this herbicide slash
[SPEAKER_00]: transgene facilitated herbicide treadmill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we go off with some other more
integrated ecological approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to get to the bright spot in
just a minute where I'm going to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing these things, but I will say
on the dark spot side, EPA and USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to deregulate and allow these
stacked trait things to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has happened in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been a source of great
frustration to me personally that we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't able to make a more compelling
argument not to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why should we care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my version of a flower plot,
another group discussion paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine in Foley's picture,
so we call it a spider plot, looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: spider web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan's are flower plots, but it's
basically the length of the vector that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this spider plot is arguing
that glyphosate, if glyphosate is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the spider plot, in other words,
these other new herbicides are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to glyphosate and their toxicity
increases as you go out on the vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were all equally cool
toxicological profiles to glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would remain in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're bigger than that, they have a
bigger toxicological effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's 2,4-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that the gene we're putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Dicamba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what the projected
toxicological impact, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: of using 2,4-D would be in the environment
with these indicators of ecosystem health,
[SPEAKER_00]: avian diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ecotox profile data taken
out of the herbicide tech reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point is that these things are
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're active in ways that we would
rather not use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, if you go back to some
of the papers in the mid-90s, it's rather
[SPEAKER_00]: circular and disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The argument for glyphosate-resistant
crops was that we would not be using
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,4-D, Dicamba, and Trilate anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the driving arguments for
the deregulation of glyphosate crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there is a paper in Science in
2007, the title of which read,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicamba resistance will preserve
biotechnology weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the Student Political Union the
other night, the students were asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were just asking to see, but we
weren't looking at slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking, what are some of the
reasons why we would care that pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: use would increase in a dramatic way?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out there's a guy, Jack Barbash,
who works with the USGS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of the guys overseeing the
National Water Sample Collection Database
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack said that, well, you should go
look at some of my papers, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the argument, from my point of view,
why you're concerned about using more
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason, he says, is that when we
use more things over a larger area,
[SPEAKER_00]: the likelihood that we see it popping up
in water samples, popping up in reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: grabs, popping up in other places,
increases by a functional relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: that is tied to the nature of the
biochemical degradation pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, of the herbicide active
ingredients, or insecticides, or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he would argue, that's the
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the potential then for
increased exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, one of your classmates
and his advisor I see is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Franklin Egan was doing some really cool
work where we were asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Jack Barbash is saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases the likelihood that the
herbicides wind up in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were interested in asking the question,
what happens when the increased likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: of the herbicide lands in the field edge
on flowering plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Franklin spent five years of time
doing empirical studies, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling, looking at the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very low level drift rates of these
herbicides into the floral community and
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential knock-on effects,
the insect visitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, this is just one of
the graphics from that work, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf cover drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floral area drops as a function of the
exposure that's occurring in the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is ironic to me, because we were
invited to come to the President's
[SPEAKER_00]: National Bee Summit a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we went down there for this,
all about plantings to enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in the midst of making this
decision about deregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, gosh, if we would not do the
2,4-D decamba thing, from a sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis point of view, what are the
hammers that are going to be bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to paying farmers to plant
little strips here and there, this could
[SPEAKER_00]: be happening on every soybean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every soybean field edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking, let's make sensible
decisions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another student, Nelson Debaros,
fashioned a field edge plant garden after
[SPEAKER_00]: some of Anna Fiedler and Doug Landis's
work in Michigan State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: where Nelson was very interested in who
goes to which of these plants in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: edge, from a beneficial insects point of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't need to make a great deal of
sense of this graphic, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bipartite network with wild bees on the
right and field edge plants on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger, the taller the box for bombus
impatiens, the more bombus there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: More bombus than bombus bimaculatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can map, where did the bombus
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to New England Aster,
and they went to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start to understand which of
these species are playing a greater or
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller role in provisioning insects in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then take plants out of the
network, that network graphic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Eupatorium perfoliatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Eupatorium perfoliatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supports lots of pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric Bonenblust and Franklin then took
Eupatorium perfoliatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started stressing it with
drift level doses of the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, Eric was looking at floral
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it declines as the rate increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, so too does visitation
by the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, you reduce the
floral area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visitation drops off both from a
floral area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eric and Anthony Vaudo have been
measuring a decline in the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: food from those plants, as well as the
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead with the deregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has been very picky, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are state level approvals of the
dicamba label to be used at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has been one of the more sticky
actors in allowing it to be done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania just approved it recently to
be used for this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is frustrating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here comes the bright spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really am excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we certainly could spend hours on the
bright spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to just talk about one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just take a case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 16 years I've been at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not going to claim that I had
anything but just the smallest little dip
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with this, because I've been working
with cover crops, along with so many other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I drove down to Washington,
DC last week to finish up some panel work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saw 40% of the fields covered in
green cover crops on my drive down through
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland and Southern PA, that warms your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same drive 16 years ago, I think you
might have seen a field here and there lit
[SPEAKER_00]: up with cereal rye and clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new, and this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patterns of adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say a couple of things
about patterns of adoption, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an either alternative to what we
just saw in the dark spot, or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: important supplementation to the dark spot
to help make this patched over some in my
[SPEAKER_00]: way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember doing the congressional
testimony, and people were really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops won't work, they said in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011, cover crops wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly won't help with the
resistance problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we knew cover crops worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just said, well, just talk to some of
the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also now have some cool data on the
resistance things that a number of labs
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I am really
excited about is so we can have one model
[SPEAKER_00]: of a company that's pushing through with
this dicamba trait or the 2,4-D trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have this packaged thing with
the seed and the inputs, the antithesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to me is a farmer-facilitated network
of learning where the farmers are sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge with each other about practices
that work for them that are adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: their local space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say just a very brief bit about
that, keeping an eye on the time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the students, and there have
been many of these studies done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Abby Hamilton just finished doing a
survey, New York is at 10% cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania, 17%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland, 27%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delaware, 26% adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa, 1.3% adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, 7% adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Northeast is making really good
progress here.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your challenges, but I mean,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 27% in states that have environmental
market payment incentives to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental market payment incentives
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax and spend liberal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build it into the farm bill,
and let's get it going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is multifunctional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly, just some really cool data.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Wallace interviewed here for a
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited about the possibility of that
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is data that John worked up and
shared with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops, you're going to see the data
splash up in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different cover crops, and their capacity
to retain nitrogen, and their capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress weeds that have evolved
resistance to the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be my way of thinking with
the alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ideal one would be high up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: High retention, high suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so good, low suppression, low
retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data are really exciting,
study after study.
[SPEAKER_00]: High retention, high suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the practices that I was driving
through when I was going down to DC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal rye, cereal rye, and forage radish
and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystem service provisioning,
pest suppression, reduction in selection
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistance of plants to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multifunctional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at one axis, reducing resistance
selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can certainly, here's four axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have six or more or whatever
number we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun when you do this with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you what the axes need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we measure them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do this together?
[SPEAKER_00]: More data on, in this case, cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, high numbers or high suppression of
weeds as a function of some adding some
[SPEAKER_00]: residual fertilizer to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally bumps up the aggressiveness of
the cover crop, reducing weed problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: John went on to take an approach that
Bruce Maxwell and Marie Jasniak and others
[SPEAKER_00]: have taken to looking at this at the
population level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the cover crop is having a
profound effect on reducing selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance arriving in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just wanted to turn to the
power of citizen science and farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation with this cover crop case
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you guys here at Cornell are
doing some work like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some very interesting work that
Ebony Morell and Charlie White and others
[SPEAKER_00]: at Penn State have been doing where
they're interested in better understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: how our research station results translate
onto farmers' fields by taking treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: from the research station and asking the
farmer if they would implement the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment on their farm and then observing
some of the same things we observe at the
[SPEAKER_00]: research station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, this was a designed
mixture of cover crops that would enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem service provisioning that's
comprised of red clover, Austrian winter
[SPEAKER_00]: pea, cereal rye, and canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like that in the early
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's flash over to the research
station result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cereal rye is green, canola is
purple, pea is blue, and red clover is
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wedge is the proportional biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 3 quarters of biomass was comprised of
cereal rye and the other wedges by canola,
[SPEAKER_00]: pea, and red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have a tendency to start
repeating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ecosystem service provisioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then, Charlie, took this to three other
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results looked like this across
the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on this for like six
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, four years in, I was fascinated
with this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the most fascinating part of the
study for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had spent 30 acre place-based
experiment observing things behaving like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go to the farmer's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it observes like this in one farm,
this in another farm, and this one in
[SPEAKER_00]: another farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local context shapes the dynamics of
interplanted competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we have been doing then with
this data, we use this data for
[SPEAKER_00]: justification for renewal of a proposal
entitled Farm Tuting Your Cover Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocktail, which was funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have these experiments out on
about 11 farms, several in southern New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, most of them in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have now hypotheses about what's
driving the wedges to turn out the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've kind of really are rethinking
the way we went into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went into this with the idea that you
want to have some proportion of rye and
[SPEAKER_00]: such and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're realizing, actually,
that the way we should be thinking of this
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the individual place should tell
you what it needs and then design the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to what the site tells you.
[SPEAKER_00]: High in nitrogen, don't plant legumes or
plant very much fewer of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're coming up with models now derived
from the farmer's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had an advisory committee meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Ebony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the farmers that's working
on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ebony basically works their data
up for them because they're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they basically tell us what the
data mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fascinating, one after another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe says this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sue says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the learning that's been going on in
this farm and a farmer exchange where
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers, in this case, are the
facilitator, convener, sharer of the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to do something with the data,
but then let the farmers do the talking
[SPEAKER_00]: and do the thinking out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great space for conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see how it improves the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after lunch, Ebony would show
everyone's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Tor Asher's farm, Dobson,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start working with models on
growing degree days, nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, et cetera, to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charlie White and Ebony now have a
working model that actually will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in these variables that are going to
tell us something about what you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: want in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have been doing this in an
iterative way with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really exciting, bright, pest suppression,
pollinator support, multifunctional
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, not single tactics aimed at one
weed species or a suite of weed species,
[SPEAKER_00]: as was in the dark midsection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary then,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really excited about all of us
working toward practices where we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about weed suppression alone,
or we're not thinking about insect pest
[SPEAKER_00]: problems alone, but that we're thinking
about the suites of things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out of the management and
stewardship that we are putting into
[SPEAKER_00]: individual fields and into the management
of landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also convinced that we don't know near
enough about how we quantify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Denise Finney has been working down
where we are, has been doing some really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff on the quantitative assessment
of multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got a long ways to go there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've learned in the
process of doing the science over 31 years
[SPEAKER_00]: as a faculty member and eight more as a
graduate student, and I learned it really
[SPEAKER_00]: late actually, is that there's a lot of
power in challenging misleading,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what, paradigms of misleading
statements, misleading claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to encourage one
another to be more active in challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: statements that either don't make
ecological sense or make agronomic sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than maybe deciding I'm too busy to
do that or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I decided I was too busy or naive
for about 20 plus years and kicked into
[SPEAKER_00]: gear about eight years ago on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's been very telling to kind
of see how important it is and also
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how little some other folks really
know about these things that we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: so much about and need help to understand
better in the decision-making frame space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's sometimes the case,
I think, that people will dismiss
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologically-based things as being kind
of, this is just for little agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this is just for gardeners,
or it's just academic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing you will hear people
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cover-cropping thing is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers are ecologically-minded folks
that are excited about this, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I have been for a while,
and I'm increasingly very excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: this facilitation role that we play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve on the board for the Pennsylvania
Association for Sustainable Ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at their conference that usually about
1,800 folks attend, the farmer-to-farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange and their excitement about data
collection and sharing data really struck
[SPEAKER_00]: me at the February meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there is a lot of space for us
to be actively engaged with farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, and I find that very exciting as
a hopeful wave of charting pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are going to be more
sustainable going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on the herbicide toxicity,
as you say, one of the arguments was to
[SPEAKER_03]: replace, with NAMREP, replace some of the
more toxic earlier herbicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that did happen for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mismanaged as a document.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did reduce overall toxicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just pounds of herbicide that
matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got into this later, but I just wanted
to highlight that, that one could imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: using such a tool more carefully and
avoiding the resistance problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could have been another pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could have provided some benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm getting at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I'm trying to say is
technologies are technologies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's really about how we use them as
opposed to this whole technology should be
[SPEAKER_03]: on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did everybody hear the question or the
comment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before glyphosate crops came online,
glyphosate was replacing something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was replacing some older herbicides
that were problematic from nature tops,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be misleading to look at total
amount of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hubris of how we use them and the
wisdom that we approach technology with
[SPEAKER_00]: should be something that we should be much
more thoughtful about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more with both of those
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I guess it's my feeling that I
haven't seen us be very careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: technology adoption, honestly,
in the 13th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the complicating factor on making
wise decisions about technology is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this enormous market force
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw it, and it's not written up
anywhere very often, but I saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that market force look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The market force looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, we'll sell you the seed at full
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pesticide, you go get the
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the while, the seed companies
are buying the input companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have over 70% of the pesticide
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seed companies are the one and the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: One by five companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company then says, if you buy the
herbicide and the seed, I'll give you 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty enticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are working on the margin,
and that looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, if you buy 100 units,
we'll give you the 20% discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy 1,000 units, we'll give you 35%
discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technology, when we think about
technology, I think we need to really also
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand the market and
technology in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think in this kind of system,
they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very difficult to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should look at the technology on
its merits, and then also look at how the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make a comment about what you haven't
spoken about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that with Nigerian products.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make claims, too, that they're pretty
dramatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you mentioned the crop crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really great area, and I think it's
really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you see as far as when you
move across the country, and there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: as high rainfall, and you get into systems
where you get up into it today about,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, the crop crop is now using the
moisture that the crop is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you see in those situations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should absolutely be clear that I was
choosing that as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nebraska, where you're at the margins
of ready-fed agriculture, in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: third of the state, where I used to work,
is the point in which evaporation exceeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: or precinct, precinct is less than
evapotransportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do carbon tracking very well
there unless you're here at day,
[SPEAKER_00]: because water is so precious in the
system, or at least you have to agree on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Iowa, or go to eastern
Nebraska, and we were discussing this
[SPEAKER_00]: again this morning, there's this whole
movement in a two crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get a winter crop into a
corn-soaked rotation as a investment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an all-time functional
agro-emulsion-bound solution for the
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's absolutely a
question in the regionality of how some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things will play out, and should
play out, is highly contingent on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are reasons why Iowa farmers have
around 1.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you're growing is corn and soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The window, you've got the cover crops
going, and the fall is very small compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing silage corn in Pennsylvania
when the corn is taken six weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we have a deficit, and that's
all the part that I was thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: the system in the context of where it's
being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there, in my view,
there, I think this serves that these two
[SPEAKER_00]: folks here have a lot of, there's a lot to
be worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting comfortable in a local space and
understanding the strengths of the farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are working with them, and then
designing ecological-based approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just wondering if you have ideas
about how we're really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentally change the agro-ecological
policies of the national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems like that's what's really
driving the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The incentives are not well-matched with
multi-functional agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The incentives, the reward yield are still
dominant, and that also impacts the
[SPEAKER_01]: nonstandard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think the syndrome is a good way
to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all connected, and it's a very tight
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you get into what's really big
ag that's the global market, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what dominates and invests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of rainfall for cover crops
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're dominated by global markets,
whereas the situation in Pennsylvania and
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the systems are more diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just seems like over and over again,
the USDA and the EPA and our government
[SPEAKER_01]: decides to stay on the same track,
the most recent decision about allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: the more problematic herbicides back into
the picture a big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going on since the 1980s when
sustainable agriculture first got on the
[SPEAKER_01]: radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have ideas about how to change the
big elephant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had more ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we all have ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the things that I've
learned on the herbicide resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: business is if you're trying to influence
and sway decisions that are being made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really have to get in early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The
[SPEAKER_00]: jello is setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The form is taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room for wiggling there is kind of
going way fast, so the window is closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on the herbicide resistance thing,
I first spoke about that at the Portland
[SPEAKER_00]: IBM meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2009, and then the week
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I actually was down in DC
talking with people about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might have been around the time the
2012 paper came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would sit with the Secretary of
Agriculture in his office, and he would
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you, Dave, I've read your papers last
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right after you leave, the corn
growers from Iowa, along with Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are coming in with meetings
right after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to argue exactly the
opposite of what you just told them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I realized then was that there
needs to be a more organized and a more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully designed plan that you try to
gain traction with by getting buy-in from
[SPEAKER_00]: different groups, and that that needed to
happen well before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that the farm bill,
I've always dreaded reading the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm bill, let's read the farm bill
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the wiggle room in the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually disincentives in the
farm bill for cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some no-brainer things that,
and in fact, the most recent farm bill has
[SPEAKER_00]: taken steps to remove some of those,
but they're not all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things for example, like if you want
crop insurance in Midwestern United States
[SPEAKER_00]: for corn, you can't get crop insurance or
you couldn't with cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a perception that the
cover crops would affect corn yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: the insurance companies would be paying
farmers for depleted yields of corn that
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually due to a cover crop in
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that agroecologists,
us in this room, can help set policy
[SPEAKER_00]: makers straight on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me a place, Lauren,
is to start with the no-brainer things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and say, we need to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the farm bill needs also
to get more crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about the challenges
to this at the end of the morning meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not trivial because we have all the
same first crop crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's another big one is
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I haven't had a lot of success
working through the science societies on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my views on this wheat part of it or
outside of the wheat science society said
[SPEAKER_00]: that the science society actually was
going the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not convinced that that's the way
to go for it unless you have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: open-minded science society that's going
to be progressive in the policy world.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to kind of follow up on that
and ask the question, do you think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: enough alternative science out there in
terms of successful alternative to stem
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide pesticide pathogens that you can
actually really move at a strong pace?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's good to have the concepts and
the ideas and the limited amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like you have to have a
sufficient, do you have a sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of information to be convincing in
policy or not at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to me that that's the
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on the research outreach
community, do you have the science that is
[SPEAKER_00]: attracting, that you actually do these
things to stem?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they ask you to offer up the
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have some, I feel like we
have, I think we've got enough that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can argue that going the heavier duty
pesticide route is, we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: substitutions for that that actually would
work at the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need more?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to understand it better in
local, regional, contextual space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to understand that a lot
better than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think, again, not to repeat,
but I do think that this kind of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground when folks that are trying
to make this stuff work, and listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, is what's going to inform the right
kind of research that will provide us
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think a big thing that can
help in the data is that there was some
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA used to monitor, do a lot more
monitoring of pesticide fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could get more of that monitoring
data, we could make intelligent decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like about appropriate technologies and
blending.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it results in this polarization that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we should be arguing for more
data within reason, but more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't stop collecting pesticide
residue data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we should be giving more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we also should be somehow
doing more to make that data available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that really understand what it
might be telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it winds up getting stuck
somewhere where there's a cool analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been done, but it hasn't actually
been the full group of folks that really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what's driving those behaviors
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that starts to be very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to maybe try to add to the brightness
of the work you're bringing up with the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer to farmer, and the question about,
you know, we're always going to be limited
[SPEAKER_03]: with research, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Research is expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's possible to go on farms and do
a better job of learning what the most
[SPEAKER_03]: successful farmers are doing, that can be
quantified with researchers on farms
[SPEAKER_03]: quantifying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that does seem like it's a way to
expand the research base and also give
[SPEAKER_03]: that political, this is what a real farmer
is really doing, and you measure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem like that has some power
beyond the research base.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for me it's been
interesting just to look at when people
[SPEAKER_03]: have collected good enterprise budgets
from farms, you know, we really see what
[SPEAKER_03]: are the farmers that are making more
profit doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we could apply that kind of
budgeting approach to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs, outputs on the more eco bag
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good idea,
and we certainly have a lot more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of data coming all across the farming
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're really pushing time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's thank David.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
