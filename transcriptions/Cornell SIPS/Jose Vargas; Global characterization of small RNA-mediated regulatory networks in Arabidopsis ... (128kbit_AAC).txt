[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to introduce Jose Vargas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He comes to us from Costa Rica,
where he studied at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_01]: He contacted me about six years ago,
and after a number of communications,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was admitted, and here he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Jose to work on a number of virus
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should preface that by saying he wanted
to come here to pursue interests in
[SPEAKER_01]: virology and biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked on a number of virus systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him to set up a system to allow us
to use large-scale sequencing technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: for diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has done that over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, he's making use of the same
technologies to address some questions
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding the host response, the small RNA
response, to a virus infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, he'll be talking about the
bioinformatics efforts he's made to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze networks of small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interest of time, he will not be
discussing much about the virology,
[SPEAKER_01]: per se, but the best is still to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that as an introduction,
Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can anyone hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy to have the opportunity to
tell you about what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last five years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Keith mentioned, I've sort of been
involved in two different lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, we've been conducting
projects that involve virus and viral
[SPEAKER_00]: detection and characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves all the published work
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it's taking some time,
I only have one slide to show for today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a summary of what we publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we've been working on
spinach-latent virus of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also worked on two grapevine virus,
grapevine virus E and grapevine-asteroid
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic-associated virus, and also one
viroid in grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to move to my main thesis
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we are focusing on a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question we're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the role of small RNA-mediated
regulatory networks in host-virus
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to get it out there, I'm going to
show you my objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not make full sense right now,
but hopefully through the interaction they
[SPEAKER_00]: will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do is to identify and
describe biologically relevant small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-mediated regulatory networks,
once I have them, to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory contribution of the resulting
networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going back to my main questions,
there are three teams here that I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small RNAs, networks, and host-virus
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll start with the interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about a virus,
some may think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually a virion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A virion is an infectious particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A virus is better thought of as an
infected cell, where you have a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: complement of proteins that are not
present in the virion, but are required to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete the virus replication cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the viruses, as you know, they hijack
the cell metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they interact at many levels
with their host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to be focusing in a
series of interactions involved in immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this diagram here, I'm showing the
virus replication cycle from virus entry,
[SPEAKER_00]: genome decapitation, viral replication,
and synthesis of viral proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left, I'm showing a diagram
that is familiar to most people here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where viral products can be recognized by
pattern recognition receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of plant viruses, they will be
intracellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can trigger a PTI-based response.
[SPEAKER_00]: As expected, virus encoded effectors that
can block the PTI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consequently, the host has evolved
resistance genes that can recognize these
[SPEAKER_00]: viral proteins and trigger an PTI
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite common in pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in viruses, there's also something we
think of as adaptive immunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: where viral products can be recognized by
host protein to launch an adaptive immune
[SPEAKER_00]: response that is affected by RNAi or RNA
interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main takeaway here is that RNA
interference is involved in antiviral
[SPEAKER_00]: defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, RNA interference,
RNAi, or RNA silencing refers to multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: biogenesis pathways that are shown here in
boxes that lead to the production of small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs, which are molecules of 21 to 24
nucleotides long that are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional, translational,
or post-transcriptional regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're quite important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to call them master
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their activity has been described in
multiple cellular systems and in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular processes in various systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm showing examples where microRNAs
are referred to as master regulators in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, plants, and drosophila,
so white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these systems, they've been related
to regulation in cancer development.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our cases, plant defense response is
quite important and also genome stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, small RNAs have also been discovered
in plants to act through regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm showing here several examples
that show small RNA networks involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: development, trait dominance, and overall
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, at this point, I've
convinced you that these small RNAs are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite important regulators and that they
collectively form regulatory networks
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in multiple processes,
like defense, development, stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we go back to this plot,
I would like to point this set of proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: here that are known as viral silencing
suppressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are proteins encoded in the virus
that are able to block RNAi or RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think, when you remember,
I just sort of went through the relevance
[SPEAKER_00]: of RNA interference for regular cell
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And viruses' interference could have a
great effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I don't have the time today
to tell you mechanistically how this
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the silencing suppressors can act by
interfering with the small RNA biogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also sequester these molecules,
making them unavailable for their action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also interfere with the
proteins involved in the pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do remember that the pathways
involved in antiviral defense and regular
[SPEAKER_00]: cell metabolisms have a lot of common
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this viral interference could have a
great effect on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show one example here
where I'm showing Arabidopsis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing, well, transgenically
expressing different viral silencing
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressors from different viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, this is how a healthy
plant would look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not virus-infected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only expressing these viral
suppressor proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the effect is quite
dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that could be of interest is
that silencing suppressors are not
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusive to viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also known examples in bacterial
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Monoceringa is a well-studied
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some of the proteins have been
described or involved in a silencing
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's an onomycid pathogen by Dr.
Asoje that encodes what appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple silencing suppressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this convergence appears to indicate
that the small RNA silencing could play a
[SPEAKER_00]: very relevant role in plant defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with this in mind, and thinking that
small RNAs are massively regulators of
[SPEAKER_00]: defense and that they've worked through
regulatory networks, we developed these
[SPEAKER_00]: main research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, what is the role of small
RNA-mediated networks in immunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: For our purposes, viral infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given the existence of these common
factors between small RNA biogenesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: defense, we also have the next question,
which is, what is the effect of viral
[SPEAKER_00]: silencing suppressors in host small
RNA-mediated regulatory networks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to study this, our model is Cocumbra
mosaic virus, or CMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm showing a diagram of its genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, this ORF2B corresponds to
the protein that has silencing suppressor
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed a couple of mutants for
this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we infected our ovidopsis thaliana
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm showing the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three weeks, well, three weeks
post-inoculation, on the top, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: mock plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be uninfected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second name corresponds to plants infected
with a wild-type version of CMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two lower panels corresponds
to plants infected with a mutated version
[SPEAKER_00]: of this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they're pretty much
asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in case you were wondering,
we do know that the virus is replicated
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can detect the code protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a control, we do not detect
the silencing suppressor protein in our
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants, as expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is our experimental system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to go back and review what
we know about small RNA regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: networks in a bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to get our terms right,
a network is a set of nodes connected by a
[SPEAKER_00]: set of edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, I'm showing the nodes in blue,
which, for my presentation, corresponds to
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be small RNAs or transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green corresponds to the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, in my case, corresponds to the
interaction between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already shown that they're involved
in multiple processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, most of these networks are
composed by pairs of microRNA-in-phase
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNA-interfering RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm showing the biogenesis pathway
for microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are expressed from a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transcript is processed by dicer-like
proteins into small RNAs that are then
[SPEAKER_00]: sorted and loaded into agocontaining
complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these complexes are the effector
molecules that will lead to mRNA
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation or translation or repression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in some cases, there's a different
outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microRNA will target a transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of leading to cleavage,
it leads to the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded RNA that is then cleaved
by dicer-like proteins to produce phase
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not really evident in the
diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the name phase small RNAs refers to
the fact that these double-stranded RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: are cleaved sequentially by these dicer
proteins to produce small RNAs in tandem
[SPEAKER_00]: that are 21 nucleotides long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these small RNAs are also loaded into
agocontaining complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can then have a regulatory effect on
their targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to translate this diagram
into a network view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here, we have the microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can target transcripts, lead to
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, they will lead to the
production of phase small RNAs or phase
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, some have no activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can target other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcripts, some can even target its own
transcript or lead to secondary production
[SPEAKER_00]: of small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this creates a cascade effect where the
amount of information carried for the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial molecule grows very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, to go back to the terms,
in this case, my molecules here correspond
[SPEAKER_00]: to the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the edges are the interactions between
these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back to the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very well-studied example in a
cascade that initiates with microRNA 173
[SPEAKER_00]: and small RNAs that derive from it,
which I'm going to go through in some
[SPEAKER_00]: detail because I'm going to use it as an
example and control later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have heard of it or if you know
it, MIR 173 was described about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leads to this cascade of TASI RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: TASI RNAs refers to transacting small
interfering RNAs, which was just a first
[SPEAKER_00]: class of phase small interfering RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TASI is a subset of FASI RNAs,
just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this diagram, what I'm showing,
it's transcripts in blue ovals and small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs in orange rectangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an initial transcript that
gives rise to a mature microRNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: targets that has two transcripts to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there are actually several
small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing one that is of particular
interest because it targets another gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also leads to the production of
secondary RNAs that can then go on and
[SPEAKER_00]: target others' transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of how this cascade
effect would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, over the years, this cascade has been
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could represent one of the more
recent views of how this may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm showing a similar structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a microRNA here in the middle
that targets, in this case, four loci,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are in the middle of these clusters
that produce FASI RNAs, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: little balls around each cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was a very nice study because
they were able to link this regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade to metabolic stress, which provide
functionality for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I must say that their analysis is
restricted to a known class of microRNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: and classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew about these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just expanded on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they performed bioinformatic
target prediction for all these small RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: and performed target modulation on a few
selected targets of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not doing a whole genome-wide
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just looking at a particular
cascade of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is one precedent of a
genome-wide view of regulatory networks by
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNAs, which was performed by David
Balkum's group around 2010, where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking from a genome-wide perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they provided the initial description
of small RNA-mediated networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did some structure analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were thinking about it from a
network's point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really nice paper, which
reflects the overall potential of these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't really assess the biological
significance of it because they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: account for different types of small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that most of them that you
find in the library are not active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not do any validation for
their edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all bioinformatic or encyclical
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this in mind and going back to my
main question of what is the role of small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-mediated networks in immunity,
when thinking about how to conduct this
[SPEAKER_00]: project and what we need, I came up with a
set of requirements for the networks that
[SPEAKER_00]: we would use or a reference frame to study
that should be biologically relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be experimental support for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when going down the list and thinking
about what's known so far, we realized we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have an appropriate framework for
these comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we don't have enough
information to address this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, we decided,
well, we could try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming up with this reference frame to
study small RNA regulation became a main
[SPEAKER_00]: thesis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was to produce a model network of
small RNA interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, admittedly, I did not have a
background in programming or computational
[SPEAKER_00]: biology at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a pretty smooth process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people complain a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly inconsequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to just go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no problem to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go back to my objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Keith mentioned, my objectives would
reflect the fact that the part with
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, it's over at this point of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were hoping to hear more about
viruses, please wait until the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by now, I'm going to focus on the
networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly, I'm going to focus on
identifying and describing biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant small RNA mediated networks and
determining their regulatory contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, this is to provide a reference
frame so that we can go back to study the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of virus in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to first describe the
approach I took to identify the small RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one is to produce a model network
for Arabidopsis taliana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model network would involve
identifying all nodes and all edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have this, basically have a map of
all possible interactions using this
[SPEAKER_00]: reference frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then input expression data to
produce sample or treatment-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to do this, if I go back to my
diagram of components, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working in Arabidopsis taliana,
we know a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there's a lot of background
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the latest annotation of our
Arabidopsis genome is named Arabport 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was produced in 2016, last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here, we can get all known
microRNAs and target transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty full annotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the rest of the molecules,
I had to come up with a bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_00]: tool and a few data sets to get all this
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get into the details of the data sets
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, studies for phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For phase two, then we need, which phase
two is the quantification part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use small RNA-seq and RNA-seq to
count or provide a quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quantitative side to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for data acquisition, if you
remember, I need three types of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get small RNAs, which are
produced by small RNA-seq, RNA-seq to get
[SPEAKER_00]: all the transcripts information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll describe them on data sets in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to obtain all these molecules or
these data sets, as I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an experiment with Arabidopsis
taliana, from which we get total RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that total RNA sample,
we produce these three data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hopefully, the first two are
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a minute to describe Degram
Library, because it's actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the purposes of this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Degram Library or Degram data is what
we use to validate our edges, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: the interactions between small RNAs and
transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a two-step process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first do a prediction of all the
cleavage sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here I'm illustrating a mess of your
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find regions where small RNAs can
target and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know how they act, we can
predict how a cleavage transcript would
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move on to experimental
validation, where using molecular methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: we clone and sequence all degraded RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look for accumulation of five
prime terminal attacks of these sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: at the predicted cleavage site,
which basically means we look at our
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing data and determine if we can
find molecules that would fit our
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the validation process or how we
examine this result is a, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have time to describe it in full,
but it's a process, it's a quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment that involves a statistical
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the take-home message is that we have
experimental validation for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: edges and interactions in the networks
that I'm going to present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we do this so that a network has
that we can do biologically relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: inferences from our networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just to remind you, because this is
going to be important, and I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth between these terms,
when I talk about degraded data,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about experimental validation
of small RNA cleavage of a transcript,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in our networks corresponds to the
edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just a quick comment about the data
acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make our own libraries in the lab in
case someone is interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For RNA-seq, it's the only one where we
use a kit, but we still make them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other two data sets are produced
by somehow hybrid methodologies from Gene
[SPEAKER_00]: Gevannoni's lab and our publications that
we've adapted to our own lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the bioinformatics tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was thinking about how to present
this, I was reminded about this Italian
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher that gave a seminar in the
Italian biology seminar series a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had a great comment, and I quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that when describing your
bioinformatic pipelines to your
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, it's like showing pictures of
your kids to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you want to show them every
detail, and you think you're writing a
[SPEAKER_00]: symphony, it's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone may care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, I'm happy to tell you about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to summarize my tool in
one slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this bioinformatic pipeline or tool
that has several modules that are made to
[SPEAKER_00]: find all the nodes in my networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm making use of existing tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also modified some of them,
and I created my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same strategy for the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then my tool brings all the nodes and
edges together to produce my small RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't too painful, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking for analyzing my data and
trying to identify all the components in
[SPEAKER_00]: my networks, remember I'm trying to
produce a model network which involves all
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes, all small RNAs, and transcripts in
all edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this process, I realized that the
identification is data intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, the identification
depends on expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the expression of these small RNAs
could depend on developmental stages,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue type you use to make your
collection, or environmental cues,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to account for this, I produced my own
data sets, and also went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary of the data I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: For small RNA libraries, I made 14 small
RNA libraries from Arabidopsis plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were infected or not with CMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I got 38 data sets available at
the NCVI database that corresponds to
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type Arabidopsis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was very useful, because in
Arabidopsis, there's a lot of background
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to find data sets
corresponding to just wild-type healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, also hormone-treated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown an example of metabolic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also have libraries from different
tissue sources and also plants that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been challenged by pathogens, including
viruses and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for the Deggertum libraries,
I had the same strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produced 16 data sets, but there are
only five available at NCVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they correspond to inflorescence and
seedling tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to remind you, I'm trying to identify
these networks, or small RNA regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my diagram, the missing
components are the phacy loci that
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponds to the transcripts that
produce phacy RNAs, which are the other
[SPEAKER_00]: missing part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the identification of these components
is performed using a small RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a summary of all the libraries
that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the x-axis is the name of the
library, the identifier for the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: The set on the left corresponds to this
study, or the ones I produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the y-axis corresponds to millions
of reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in black, I'm showing the total yield
of the sequencing project when available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In blue, I'm showing the amount of all the
reads that are actually usable or
[SPEAKER_00]: pass-filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm trying to communicate here is
that the libraries are varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that into account in our
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to find those phacy loci,
which is the first step, I took each
[SPEAKER_00]: library and tried to identify these
regions using an existing tool called
[SPEAKER_00]: FaceTank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that I identified all the
regions in all my libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I summarized the results to
produce a consensus of phacy locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the results again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what I'm showing is phacy loci
detection, so regions that produce phase
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Libraries are on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis is the number of
detection events, so how many phacy loci I
[SPEAKER_00]: detect per library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, again, the results are
varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, our libraries were pretty
good for detecting phacy loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some just provided no results
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next step is to produce a
consensus loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a summary, which basically
represents repeatability, how many times a
[SPEAKER_00]: region is found to be a producer of phacy
RNAs across libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found 92 regions represented here on the
x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the y-axis is the number of times that
region is recognized across libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that most of them,
or a good amount of them, are found
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some are found in a very few
occasions, even just one time in a single
[SPEAKER_00]: library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could represent false positives,
or they could also just represent regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are expressed only under a particular
circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you remember in my diagram,
phacy loci are the regions that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: phase small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can test the activity of the small
RNAs using degram data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use this to validate this previous
set of results by asking the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the small RNAs that derive from this
loci have biological activity assessed by
[SPEAKER_00]: degram data?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have this reduced subset of 50
regions from which small RNAs derive from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Degrams actually have validated targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're wondering, where are they or
what they are, most of them corresponds to
[SPEAKER_00]: annotated regions in the genome that
correspond to coding genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our purposes, they're of great
interest, because a lot of defense-related
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are known to produce small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most evident example is NB-LLR
proteins that we know their transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce phase small interfering
RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, this is why I was mentioning
before that they're known as massive
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators of plant defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going back to our diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the consensus locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We map the small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we need to find the triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a quick reminder about what a
trigger is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trigger will represent a small RNA that
starts this process of double-stranded RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: production and subsequent cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this diagram, I must say,
this is not entirely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very quickly, I will show you a few
interesting features about small RNA or
[SPEAKER_00]: FASCy RNA biogenesis that I usually not
accounted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to my MIR173 example,
we know it targets the task 1 transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the production of small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the expected result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microRNA sets the register for the
cleavage, the sequential cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most models are based on 21
nucleotide long phase small interfering
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to show you the
evidence, but we know there are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: also 22 nucleotide long small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, this is
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you change the size for one of
these molecules, then everything gets
[SPEAKER_00]: shifted over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another important feature is that per
transcript, there could be multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers, as I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those triggers can actually set up
different registers from which new small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs can arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these small RNAs can have possible new
targets and therefore new activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it overall represents an unexplored
expanded regulatory capacity for each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then going back to my process,
I'm trying to find the triggers that set
[SPEAKER_00]: up the production of phase small
interfering RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 74% of all my transcripts,
I was able to find a trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 36% for which I couldn't identify
any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, in some cases,
I was able to find out down to three
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers per transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having this trigger information,
and just to remind you the relevance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the triggers is that they can set up
different registers from which new RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: can arise, we can now collect all the
small RNAs that derive from the different
[SPEAKER_00]: register and different sizes that I
mentioned, make a big pool, including
[SPEAKER_00]: microRNAs, and use our Degrelam data to
confirm them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm showing a brief summary of
the Degrelam data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red, this is what exists in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the NCBI database.
[SPEAKER_00]: In black, I'm showing our contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made 16 extra libraries,
which can be summarized here, where for
[SPEAKER_00]: this analysis, 89% of all the information
or all the Degrelam data used corresponds
[SPEAKER_00]: to our libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember, this is what we use
to validate the interactions between small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs and transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do that for our big pool of
small RNAs, we get these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we have two classes of small RNAs,
microRNAs, which I'm using a known set,
[SPEAKER_00]: as was described in the latest annotation
of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's 427 microRNAs reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to find activity or confirm
activity for 223, which corresponds to the
[SPEAKER_00]: most comprehensive analysis of small RNA
or microRNA activity in Arabidopsis using
[SPEAKER_00]: Degrelam data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is where my main contribution or
the main contribution of my tool is in
[SPEAKER_00]: finding all these FASC RNAs, and in
particularly, the ones that are active,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm showing here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to focus on this active set
of FASC RNAs and break them down into four
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first group corresponds to 21 phase
small RNAs, which kind of correspond to
[SPEAKER_00]: this blue set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this corresponds to the small RNAs
that most available tools would find,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are about 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's about 250 of these active
small RNAs that are in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: register than my tool is able to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there's also about 150,
which are 22 nucleotides long,
[SPEAKER_00]: that most tools will not pick up unless
you do a combined search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a subset where they're both 22
and in a different register.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, to summarize this,
what I'm saying is that using this
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, we were able to double the
number of small RNAs of known activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we expanded on the regulatory
capacity we can recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've gone through pretty much all
the motions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have to do now is remove all
non-active small RNAs and attach it all
[SPEAKER_00]: together to produce a model network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four years later, this is my small RNA
regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I was working for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a quick reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using Degralom data for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interactions, all the edges have
experimental support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, I think at least whenever I'm
confronted to something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few questions arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, I convince you that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm using experimental,
or each interaction is experimentally
[SPEAKER_00]: validated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it reflect biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to evaluate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, you may have noticed
I don't have sufficient jokes for the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of this seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any suggestion and you're
getting bored by now, I really would need,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any network jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about it so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been showing is all the steps
that lead to the production of the
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just building to this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I get the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only have a few more things to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just a quick reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The objectives were to describe and
identify and describe biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant small RNA mediated networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to show that they are actually valid,
I'm going to sort of go into that network
[SPEAKER_00]: to our old friend, Mir 173, which I've
said before, we know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if my network construction is correct,
I should be able to reconstruct what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know about Mir 173.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use this cascade for
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using this because it's a tricky
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it targets the task transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this transcript in a specific,
there's three triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's phase changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the most challenging
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to guide you, we have a microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four facile loci in the middle of
these clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The balls around it corresponds to sets of
small RNAs that derive from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're predicted to target PPR
proteins, which are proteins involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a function for this,
which has been shown to be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to recreate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to my network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get the Mir 173 subnetwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subnetwork represented here are
highlighted in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll change the view to something more
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to reconstruct it, we have one
microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four transcripts and a set of
loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so here they did bioinformatic
predictions of targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying how I do experimental
validation of targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to change the view and
show you the results for this with my
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of things to mention
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The change of colors, the blue ones,
the new ones, are all these small RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are different sizes or in a different
register.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're here to illustrate the
contribution of including all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different nuances into an analysis tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom, I'm showing all the RNA
transcript targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, hopefully you can see it,
I'm showing the PPR proteins that they
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted and validated to be targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can reconstruct the network with the
right topology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the right molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have a function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it is involved in metabolic
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took all the genes that are targeted
by this cascade and did a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment analysis using Go terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use several of these
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the size of the circle
corresponds to the breast of the category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, biological process is a
molecule much bigger category than
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then white is nonsignificant enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in color refers to
significantly enriched categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the darker, the more significant the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before you go through it, I'm just
going to direct you to this side over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which corresponds to categories
involved in defense response, and more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, to abiotic stress stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm showing here is that using my
approach and functional enrichment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could make functionally valid
inferences from our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to reconstruct or validate my
network because we have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: topology, we have the right molecules,
and we could even predict the right
[SPEAKER_00]: functions using this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summarize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have accurate identification
of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have accurate reconstruction of the
network topology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make functional inferences that are
consistent with experimental results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown how we can expand on the
regulatory capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to remind you, we use an unbiased
genome-wide approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not focusing on a particular set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do that type of analysis across
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to move very quickly to a
description of the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to change the view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it has this type of structure that
I think is easier to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to change the view to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me walk you through this
rearrangement of the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the pre-microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are transcripts that get processed
to produce microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm showing a set of microRNAs
that do not induce FASI RNA production.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the right, I'm showing the microRNAs
that do trigger FASI RNA production from
[SPEAKER_00]: this FASI loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that the produced FASI loci can in
turn trigger secondary production of small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs from other transcripts shown here and
the resulting FASI RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you remember, I said I had a
set for which I have no trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this corresponds to all the
FASI-producing regions for which I have no
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom are all the target
transcripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or each set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were wondering what kind of
genes are involved in this network,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I did a functional enrichment
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, before we go through all the
categories, I can summarize this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most categories are represented in this
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, this result triggered
another question that I think is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, which instead of looking for
categories that are enriched, because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is there, one can think of what
is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an analysis for functional
under-representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only one category that is
under-represented in my network that
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponds to genes involved in
translational regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I don't have a hypothesis
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very interesting,
but I have no way to explain it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has any idea, I'll be happy to
hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have performed other structural
analysis on the networks that I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to discuss today, but if you're
interested, I'm happy to tell you about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just going to move on to the
second objective, which involves
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the regulatory contribution of
the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary of the network
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through most of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to stress the fact that my
network includes about 20% of all known
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis genes, which should be
indicative of the overall potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about it, the
regulatory potential of this network does
[SPEAKER_00]: not only involve the genes that are there,
but also their activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be if my networks involve
regulation of a transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription factor activity would
play into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started asking what kind of genes are
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we first looked for transcription
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm highlighting in red all the
transcription factors found in our
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summary is that there's 26% of all
transcription factors are under small RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, according to our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can broaden this search by just trying
to search all genes involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our result.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% of all genes that have been
involved or have been shown to be involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in transcription regulation are under
small RNA control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, when it comes to the
contribution or the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution of my network, there's 25% of
all described genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most functional categories are
represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 30% of all genes involved in
transcription or regulation appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: under small RNA control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might be wondering, how can we
use this regulatory meta network?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, I used a composite data
set to produce this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example that may refer to plant
pathology is you can ask the same question
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing before, but for defense
response genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we look for all the genes
that have function related to defense,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% are under small RNA regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example here could be if you have
your system where your pathogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting the regulation or the
regulation of your favorite host gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: either up-regulated or down-regulated,
and you want to understand the mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: by which this is happening, you can use
this model to ask, first, is your gene
[SPEAKER_00]: under small RNA regulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is, where in the network is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many small RNAs are targeting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some useful information you can
get from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also, I want to show very
quickly, and this is the last part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, I want to show how I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to my plan, first was to produce a
model network, which I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then step two involves having expression
data to produce now sample specific
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving from a meta network to something
that corresponds to a plant or a sample or
[SPEAKER_00]: a treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show this is based on
preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to use an example using an
unaffected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember, I have RNAs and a
small RNA data set from all my samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a summary of an RNA-seq experiment
where on the x-axis, I have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 17,000 in my libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis, I'm showing the
expressions, the expression level as the
[SPEAKER_00]: log of the normalized count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a lot of libraries,
but each one of these corresponds to a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the section of
low-expression genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would correspond to high-expressed
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from a network, we know which ones are
under small RNA control, which I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to highlight here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 35% of all the genes have the
potential to be regulated by small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you remember, these interactions
make sense if both molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the small RNA and the transcript
for regulation to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to show it, but I did the
same analysis for small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can take all the data and input
it into my model network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm highlighting in red all the
nodes that show expression in an
[SPEAKER_00]: unaffected sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see the black dots
because the network is so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those will correspond to the
non-expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to take away everything
that is not expressed in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you're left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to notice here there's a
bunch of free nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This corresponds to transcripts for which
the small RNA is not present, or vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be no regulatory
contribution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look, there's still some edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the edges that still exist in this
network corresponds to instances in which
[SPEAKER_00]: the small RNA and the transcripts are
detected as expressed in an unaffected
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to change the view for
something more friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the method network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the network corresponding to my
unaffected sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as expected, it corresponds to a much
smaller subset of all the nodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one would be the ones that are
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this example, I hope that you can
imagine how we can use this to evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: virus effect on regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plan is to produce these type of
sample-specific networks and then start
[SPEAKER_00]: asking, what are the changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there structural changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I'm showing this as an on and
off state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there's a quantitative side to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also query or ask what kind of
genes are undergoing expression
[SPEAKER_00]: differences, or differential gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do they fit in these networks?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how viruses can affect this small RNA
regulatory contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take a breath now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll finish with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that for my thesis
project and this project, what I did was
[SPEAKER_00]: to construct the model network of a small
RNA regulatory global regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I confirmed the accuracy of my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And illustrated how it expands in previous
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I validated the regulatory potential of
small RNA-mediated networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically going back to those big
claims about small RNA being master
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have data to support that claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I developed a bifurcimax tool that can be
used for other species, given some
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool can be thought of as a hungry
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the more data becomes
available, we can add that data and update
[SPEAKER_00]: our model to get better resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool is not publicly available yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not sure whether we're going to
pursue a publication for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're interested, we can apply it
to other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, we finally developed
a model system that can be used to study
[SPEAKER_00]: the role of small RNAs in viral
pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your favorite topic, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for future directions, I think it
should be clear that what we want to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: use this resulting model to determine the
role of small RNA-mediated networks in
[SPEAKER_00]: viral pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what is the effect of viral
silencing suppressors in host small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-mediated networks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will be involved asking,
what is the role of small RNAs in this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype development?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just like to finish with
acknowledgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially want to thank Keith for
sticking up with me for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I particularly enjoyed the opportunity of
pursuing a project of my design and
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seemed far-fetched at the beginning,
but it was a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to thank all my committee
members for their advice and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Fuchs, Dr. Fay, and Chris Myers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially want to thank my lab members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeremy is not here today, but he's been
a great person to have in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows a lot, and he's very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather, our lab technician, also,
thank you for the support and for keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: us honest in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a set of series of undergrads
that have helped in different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to thank Andrew Grimson and
Stephanie Watson, a grad student in Andrew
[SPEAKER_00]: Grimson's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helped us during the development of
small RNA libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Julia Brevetov and June Rue and
Gene Giovannoni's lab that assisted us in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing or establishing the
library-making technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, there's also funding sources
for this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this were involved in the set of
virus-related projects that I described at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my network's project has been partly
funded by CAPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank you for
your attention and take your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering how you take all of these
different data sets and put them all
[SPEAKER_04]: together in a network in a way that,
to me, it would seem like to be completely
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that you have the pathway correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when you put it in your network,
you have to see all of those parts in the
same sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, for one sample, for one tissue
sample, you would have an sRNA library,
[SPEAKER_04]: an RNA-6 library, and then your own
library, and make sure that you see all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the parts that you need to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you use this larger set of libraries,
how does that, are you taking that into
[SPEAKER_04]: account?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how are you dealing with that to make
sure that all of the parts are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: right place at the right time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to recapitulate, the question is,
how do I know that my method network is
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of a network that would
occur in a single sample?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because what I'm thinking is,
if you have a degram sample from
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabidopsis roots, and you find the
cleavage, but your microRNA and the small
[SPEAKER_04]: RNAs are in shoots, it's not really
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back to this figure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually, maybe this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the regulatory effect to occur,
you need the small RNA and the transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: to be present at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, all the free nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a network for an uninfected
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it represents one treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually represents tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're dealing with tissue averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the free nodes in this network
corresponds to instances in which one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two in the pair is not present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't see expression,
we don't make a connection when we
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate it in a single library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing you can consider is,
they also have to be present in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cell or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, that's not entirely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not cell autonomous, so they can
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that using the approach of tissue
averages is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even if we have both nodes expressed
in the same tissue library, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I'm not trying to evaluate
cleavage per library.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm evaluating expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we're going to use this is in
a comparative form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I produce this type of network in an
uninfected and an infected sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see how the dynamics change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be able to see if a microRNA
expression goes up and its target
[SPEAKER_00]: correspondingly goes down, that would
correspond to meaningful interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the downstream analysis would
be based on that, on looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics of each pair upon different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about where you build
the reference network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reference network is just a map of
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't necessarily exist in any
given plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, they may never be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one could think that some of these
nodes never occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is showing the overall regulatory
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at expression, then we see
which ones are active and which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is that when we started,
we were planning to do a network per
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that the results are not
comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a model network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a fascinosa that has
very, very low expression, you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: detect it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our aim was to get all the map,
all the interactions map, and then input
[SPEAKER_00]: expression data to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering whether there is any
difference of the face transactive mine
production or the capture between the
virus infected or not infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that whether the virus can be
infected can cause some difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: the face transactive mine production or
the transmission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it show the face lose eye like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually what we plan to do
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about a virus acting,
so I mentioned that viruses encode
[SPEAKER_00]: silencing suppressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And silencing suppressors will affect the
production of small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a virus setting, you may be
preventing the production of these
[SPEAKER_00]: microRNAs over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you block the production of microRNAs
over here, you may lose all the downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of potential genes
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the data yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to know how viruses
will change this structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know they can target each step.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interest of time, I think I will
ask you to thank Jose and anyone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in discussing it further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
