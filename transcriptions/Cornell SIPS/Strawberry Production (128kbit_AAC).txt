[SPEAKER_01]: and I have that it is 101 if the rest of
you Want to just try to vote and then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: close these polls
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a last-minute flurry of people
signing on that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully everyone can hear
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to introduce myself I'm
Laura McDermott I work for Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooperative Extension in the capital
district region and do vegetable and small
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit Extension education and I'm working
for dr. Marvin Pritz on the Northeast IPM
[SPEAKER_01]: funded webinar Series that we're putting
on with a great deal of help from invited
[SPEAKER_01]: experts throughout the Northeast region so
our thanks to the Northeast IPM Center for
[SPEAKER_01]: their funding assistance and to all of the
Research researchers that we'll be hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: from over the next several months and also
my Great deal of thanks go to my colleague
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy Heidenreich who is has been
instrumental in trying to get the Press
[SPEAKER_01]: releases and all the PR out for this
series and for dr. Marvin Pritz guidance
[SPEAKER_01]: in it So let's get on with it the first
session that we have scheduled today is
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative strawberry production Methods
and it features two guest speakers Kathy
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemcheck who's the senior extension
associate associate at Penn State
[SPEAKER_01]: University Kathy has a background in
vegetable and fruit nutrition and has been
[SPEAKER_01]: integral to berry and plastic culture
research in the state of Pennsylvania So
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really happy to have her and I'm
actually going to let her begin our Begin
[SPEAKER_01]: our talk here in just one second and I'm
jumping in a head slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that everybody sees
these additional resources that are listed
[SPEAKER_01]: here and those are things that you can
access by not clicking on they're not live
[SPEAKER_01]: links, but you can cut and paste them into
your browser if you're interested in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and any of those resources and it just in
case people are still not aware of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this if you have a question,
please type in this skinny box at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom of the chat and either hit return
or hit send message arrow And I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a little feedback from Sue that
the sound keeps breaking up I'm sorry Sue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I wish I knew how to fix that and
hopefully it's not breaking up for other
[SPEAKER_01]: folks My audio and I'll give you a ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So let me move now into the
classroom And I'm going to introduce Kathy
[SPEAKER_01]: Demchek again senior extension associate
at Penn State University and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn off my Talking and give a call and
I'm gonna Just turn this over to Kathy
[SPEAKER_01]: Demchek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well already I'll jump into this At this
point if anybody does have questions or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything feel free to type them in if we
end up Getting too many questions in and
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets too distracting We may end up
holding them for the end But for now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say if there's anything that I'm
talking about that's unclear to you Please
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to just type something in and
I'll try to not get myself too far off
[SPEAKER_00]: track on things All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to talk about here is
Northeastern approaches that are used to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing strawberries on plastic now most
of the information does apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeastern United States for those who
are a little West of here and there were
[SPEAKER_00]: some folks from Ohio for example or in the
Midwest Most of what I will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: would apply to those situations as well So
we're going to jump into things here You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the most common reasons we get for
why growers are interested in growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic Are listed here weed control is
probably the number one reason that people
[SPEAKER_00]: give when they're growing strawberries and
matted row production Often they just get
[SPEAKER_00]: tired of trying to deal with the weeds And
the plastic helps with that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other advantages There is a
shorter time to establishment than you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have in matted row production
Typically you can plant during the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: or early fall And still harvest the next
spring so it cuts off several months that
[SPEAKER_00]: during which problems might develop
Typically you'll get better quality fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily in the area of size But flavor
can can also be excellent with plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: culture Berries typically the fruit will
come in two to three weeks earlier But
[SPEAKER_00]: that really depends on your management and
that doesn't have to happen if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: frost pocket there are some things you can
do to To keep the fruit from coming in too
[SPEAKER_00]: early a frost is a concern for you higher
marketable yields You may not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: get higher total yields, but if everything
is managed well Hopefully you will get a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher percentage of fruit that is
marketable And your marketable yields will
[SPEAKER_00]: be higher than they might be in matted
row, but again, that's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: true either Berries will tend to pick
faster in that if you have larger berries
[SPEAKER_00]: your labor costs can then go down For for
berries that are picked Ahead and sold as
[SPEAKER_00]: ready-picked and a lot of our growers are
getting a higher price for plastic culture
[SPEAKER_00]: berries because of the higher quality Now
here's the disadvantages on plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: culture berries are expensive to establish
if you were using plug plants which are
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of plants for which The system
was originally developed for use with
[SPEAKER_00]: Their expense of at about 21 cents per
plant and a plant population of around
[SPEAKER_00]: 15,000 plants per acre The cost adds up
fairly quickly so you can you know spend
[SPEAKER_00]: $3,000 on plants alone It does help if you
have a trickle and overhead irrigation the
[SPEAKER_00]: trickle Is a necessity overheadness
overhead irrigation and will come in handy
[SPEAKER_00]: in a couple of situations like for frost
control And then plastic mulch there's
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with the cost but also disposal And
and just the environmental costs of using
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of plastic can be an issue,
too The one other expense it's fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: large is a row cover that can be as much
as $1,500 per acre depending on the row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover you're using and Management in this
system is is intensive So you know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some some potential there if you aren't
able to keep up with what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the planting Where you can get into a
little bit of trouble and all that puts it
[SPEAKER_00]: together into being a high risk type of
situation, but There also is a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for high returns if you can get everything
working together well So plastic culture
[SPEAKER_00]: as it was developed for use in the south
Eastern United States where basically it
[SPEAKER_00]: was adapted from production systems used
elsewhere in that situation Typically plug
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are used plants are planted during
the fall either late September or early
[SPEAKER_00]: October In that situation there really are
less times for there is less time for
[SPEAKER_00]: problems to develop typically fumigation
will be used and there will be high raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds that will warm up quickly most of the
production is with either Chandler or
[SPEAKER_00]: Camarosa and It is used as an annual
system when we take it to the north
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we'll need to move that planting
time to be earlier either into mid or late
[SPEAKER_00]: summer You may use plug plants you also
may use dormant plants and we'll go into
[SPEAKER_00]: some particulars on that Growers may or
may not use fumigation if they can rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: crop rotation They may not need need
fumigation typically most of the beds That
[SPEAKER_00]: will be made for plastic culture here are
lower than in the south most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers will use Plastic mulch laying and
bed raising equipment that they will also
[SPEAKER_00]: use for vegetable production and Chandler
still works really well here, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some other varieties that can be used
and Typically growers may carry plantings
[SPEAKER_00]: over for a second year, so we will go into
that More as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in case You aren't familiar with
plug plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a tray of plug plants would
look like So when I refer to those you you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we're talking about basically
they are runner tips that are taken from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants rooted in in this case a 50 cell
tray and then It'll be vegetative actively
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants that that are you planted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so some of the modifications we use
for using this system in the northeastern
[SPEAKER_00]: unit us really depends on understanding
how the plant grows and responds to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment if We understand how the plant
is likely to respond to different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques We might use that modify the
environment Then we might know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: change if we need to increase our yields
further or just want to try some different
[SPEAKER_00]: things So first I just want to talk real
briefly about how strawberry plants do
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to the environment Runners are
produced during periods when you have long
[SPEAKER_00]: days and high temperatures our typical
summertime conditions and So what that
[SPEAKER_00]: means is when we move planting dates up We
may run into some some issues with with
[SPEAKER_00]: runner production with having more runners
than we actually want Under conditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: cold temperatures in short days like we
have in the fall in the early spring
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have branch crowns formed on plants
and Those those are basically you know
[SPEAKER_00]: side branches on the mother plant each of
those branch crowns Can produce one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit trusses?
[SPEAKER_00]: and so really dependent on having those to
hive high yields from a particular plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and Then do it when we have periods of
short days and long nights That's when
[SPEAKER_00]: flower buds are initiated that'll happen
in the fall and also can happen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early spring as well This is something
that isn't strictly temperature dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: or strictly day-length dependent
temperature can affect this as well
[SPEAKER_00]: finally how the plant responds can depend
with a care cultivar and so This also
[SPEAKER_00]: explains why some cultivars do better in
some areas of the country and not so well
[SPEAKER_00]: and others and So like I mentioned
modifying any components to the system
[SPEAKER_00]: will affect how how the plants respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of yields will get so you
know in a nutshell when typically we were
[SPEAKER_00]: using Plastic culture in warm areas,
and we'd use plug plants planted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall you'd end up with high yields that
would result from having numerous branch
[SPEAKER_00]: crowns formed and Also once those branch
crowns are formed you'd still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly long period for flower bud
Initiation so you could get high yields
[SPEAKER_00]: from those individual plants Planted in
the plastic culture beds in matted row
[SPEAKER_00]: production where we were planting dormant
crowns in the springtime Our yields are
[SPEAKER_00]: really dependent on having full beds so
you'd have those runners and daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: plants produced during the long days of
the summer and Then flower bud initiation
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place on those plants during the
fall so even if we got an early fall if we
[SPEAKER_00]: Just had a short period for flower bud
initiation We still had a lot of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that could could still give us
high yields And all that might be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of an oversimplification,
but that's kind of you know in general how
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some of the things how some of
the things work and Why we need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the changes we need to make so
plastic culture in cooler areas some
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations we have we do have a
relatively short fall a short growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season in general and Then cold winter
temperatures, and we need to modify some
[SPEAKER_00]: things to deal with all of these So issues
on that short fall season if we are using
[SPEAKER_00]: plug plants one of the first Field studies
we had done was looking at planting date,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we you know often
recommend people do when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: considering Trying plugs in a plastic
culture system is determine their optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: planting date for us in Central,
Pennsylvania Which at our research farm is
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness own 6a just to give you an idea
of you know where we're starting from on
[SPEAKER_00]: this We needed to plant our plants by the
middle of August This is an issue because
[SPEAKER_00]: there just aren't enough plug plants
Available early enough to supply the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand for them In in northern areas and
even when we thought we would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get plug plants We didn't always get them
when we thought we would and so what that
[SPEAKER_00]: meant was sometimes there would be delays
in planting that often frequently happened
[SPEAKER_00]: for growers and one thing we found was
that for each two week delay we had in our
[SPEAKER_00]: planting date we basically cut our yields
in half and so You know that's that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big problem to have to deal with because
you just can't get the yields That you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to pay for the inputs in
that kind of a situation So we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at some other alternatives for what
we can do here Okay, if you can't get plug
[SPEAKER_00]: plants You can try to root your own plugs
from runner tips that you can order from
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries that sell them even then you can
sometimes run into issues where the
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries may not have the plants may not
go into runner production to the extent
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need them to due to just weather
conditions or you know for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: they've had some sort of a failure and You
just can't still can't get the tips
[SPEAKER_00]: another option is to use dormant plants
that you can plant directly into the
[SPEAKER_00]: raised beds instead and then a third
option is to basically turn dormant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into plug Plants and so we'll go into and
each of those just a little bit Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for interrupting But there's one
question from Paul about what is a plug
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're gonna talk about
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry for interrupting Yes No,
no, I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I failed to notice that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that is a plug plant right there and
What that is is well go into it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit but but basically what you do is you
take a tip off of off of a runner that is
[SPEAKER_00]: You know on a mother plant and then you
root it into a medium in a tray And so
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll look like this little vegetative
plant and we'll go I'm going to flip back
[SPEAKER_00]: forward here Into how you do that pretty
much you need a miss system now I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go into all the details here
because that could be another you know ten
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes in itself, but There is I'll call
your attention to it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down the small fruit consortium down
in Southeast US www.smallfruits.org At
[SPEAKER_00]: that site right there What you can you can
visit it and there is some information on
[SPEAKER_00]: on producing your own plug plants We also
had an article back in it in Penn State
[SPEAKER_00]: small fruit and vegetable because you have
vegetable and small fruit because that
[SPEAKER_00]: back in June 2004 that hopefully you'll be
able to Google or use a search engine for
[SPEAKER_00]: And find that article, but it does give
you details on how to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically what you will do is Either
either get runner tips from a nursery You
[SPEAKER_00]: may be able to produce your own,
but you do want to absolutely make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that those plants are clean you don't
really You know just want them to be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you've gotten That's you
know from a planting where they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: running out into the row middle you'd like
to be able to keep them clean with some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of some sort of way to Keep them
clean perhaps using a landscape fabric or
[SPEAKER_00]: or plastic on the ground But what you do
is you will cut the tips off of off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: runners You want to do that when they're
just starting to to unfold their leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take about 35 days from the time you
cut those plants and stick them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing medium It'll take about 35 days
from the time you do that until you have
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you have a rooted plant that you can
use You need to do this like say typically
[SPEAKER_00]: we use Trays that have 50 cells in them
you'll want to use a media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fairly well drained You'll need a
way to anchor them hair pins work really
[SPEAKER_00]: well actually for just done holding that
little Runner tip down you just leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: little stub on it you anchor them in Keep
them under mist that you gradually
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease over the period of about two two
weeks and then You just let them harden
[SPEAKER_00]: off Or at least you wean them off of the
mist and then they're good to go So I just
[SPEAKER_00]: just do want to point out that you do need
to make sure you have a clean source of
[SPEAKER_00]: those and they are fairly You know like
say fairly easy to root yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you do need to have the time and
some sort of structure to protect Them so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there are some inputs into doing
that and the second option, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the best best option for Northern
production is to use dormant plants there
[SPEAKER_00]: you can plant them anytime from June
through July and The issue with that we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about how plants will runner during
the summer is that once you're on plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to remove the runners during
the summertime So they can go crawling off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plastic and root in the row middles
where you don't really want them So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of an issue for for them,
so You'll need to do that you still have
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a year till harvest time then one
thing I do want to point out if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using dormant plants is that Temperature
really has a big effect on the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants, so if you get them too early
And you don't have the conditions where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep them really cold and by
really cold we mean 30 or 31 degrees We
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even want them up around 35 or 36
degrees Because they basically will start
[SPEAKER_00]: to use up some of their carbohydrate
reserves at those higher temperatures So
[SPEAKER_00]: we really want them to stay at the nursery
or in a location where they're kept cold
[SPEAKER_00]: enough until you can actually plant them
We've had some growers get into trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've lost maybe 50% of the plants
And you know they'll just You know be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: real trouble at that point because then
they have difficulty getting getting
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement plants So we do want to
mention that there is a planting tool that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use and rather than Try to use any
kind of a mechanical planter or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually do recommend planting those by
hand and Basically you will use this tool
[SPEAKER_00]: which looks almost like a notion Nail pool
or a metal nail pool or that you might use
[SPEAKER_00]: to push the roots down in Into the soil
and that works surprisingly well what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do is just poke holes in the plastic first
mark where they're going and then use the
[SPEAKER_00]: tool to push the plant roots down into the
ground and Again, if you go to the www
[SPEAKER_00]: .smallfruits.org website there is an
article there where they have photographs
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrating how you do this and that
they're Right up is actually for fresh dug
[SPEAKER_00]: plants which are green plants that we
can't use this far north But but the
[SPEAKER_00]: principle is still the same and the root
system still is very similar So you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives you an idea of how it works And
then if you can water them after planting
[SPEAKER_00]: that really helps with getting them
established when we've used dormant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if the plants are in good shape
to start with and we can get them watered
[SPEAKER_00]: in we have very good establishment with
them and It's nice to see that the note
[SPEAKER_00]: from Kip there that that he can get good
establishment Too so it's you know not
[SPEAKER_00]: just us in our in our research plots Where
can you get the planting tool?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain whether Norse farms I
believe Norse farms may have it or they
[SPEAKER_00]: may have instructions on how to how to
make one I know some of our growers if you
[SPEAKER_00]: see what the pictures look like it's
actually something that is fairly easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: make yourself and I actually did end up
using our nail puller Which was about a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot long metal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know metal thing with a v-notch in the
end, and it actually worked pretty well I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might chop the roots off with it at some
point But anyway, I have seen that boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of Indiana Berry There
were a couple places with the nurseries
[SPEAKER_00]: where I've seen planting tools advertised
One other thing I want to mention on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant plants is that There is a lot of
interest in using Apogee there had been
[SPEAKER_00]: research done in Massachusetts and Marv
thinks there there was research done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland, Maine and Massachusetts where
they found that Apogee did increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of branch crowns and decreased
runner production and trials So there is
[SPEAKER_00]: grower interest in that because it results
in in higher higher yields, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a labeled UCI So I just want growers to be
aware of that We're hoping that in a short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time within that well relatively
short period of time within the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years That we've that label may
come through Alrighty so dormant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: another advantage with them is that you do
have a choice of cultivars a wider choice
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivars than you might with plug
plants But I want to point out that not
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the cultivars that can be used or
work well in matted row production may
[SPEAKER_00]: work well in plasticulture Is there a
similar product to Apogee for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: users?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I am aware of To answer that
question there Yeah, that's something we
[SPEAKER_00]: may just need to hold off on for a while
and you know see if there is some some
[SPEAKER_00]: other way of dealing with that for organic
folks in the future, but I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised if anything Came through any
time in the near future on that Let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that work besides Chandler that
our growers have been happy with Wendy
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamour Wendy's got a really nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really impressed with the flavor and
the size on that one Lamour has just done
[SPEAKER_00]: well for us pretty much in every aspect of
production size quality disease resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole nine yards and then Doris select
and Seneca Are a couple of other cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are using that they seem to be
happy with ones that haven't done so well
[SPEAKER_00]: For us early glow all the ones I have
listed their early glow all-star ovation
[SPEAKER_00]: ventana guy of the Oda And we've had yield
low yields on those and some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: really kick into runner production on the
plastic And so though they might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: a great cultivar and matted row production
You just end up with a lot of runners in
[SPEAKER_00]: in plastic culture and not necessarily
that much Now one other thing you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a particular cultivar that you
really like as as a cultivar in matted row
[SPEAKER_00]: production you can Get dormant plants in
that cultivar and try plugging your own
[SPEAKER_00]: plants Just you know give it a shot see
how they do we do have a couple of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: who are doing that the real challenge is
getting the Plants into the cells and they
[SPEAKER_00]: do need to trim the roots a fair amount
and it's just you know enough to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to fit into Some sort of cells we use
larger cells a 32 cell tray But the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: depth can be an issue just getting them
down in far enough Now the advantage is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this is that you do know whether
your plants are going to survive or not
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly early on And so you know you're
just putting plants that are that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing well out in the field It's easy to
keep a close eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to take runners off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when they're right there in a
condensed location plus you can treat
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests but again that does require some
some labor and having a structure to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect them Now other approaches other
approaches growers in the northern or
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler regions will use I'm just holding
their plantings over for a second year For
[SPEAKER_00]: a second harvest year and that that seems
to work quite well You may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in yields in various size,
but some of that is just related to
[SPEAKER_00]: management To keeping the planting disease
and insect free And keeping enough new
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen and water water on the planting
if you do decide to try that You'll
[SPEAKER_00]: probably want to use heavier plastic we
use a one point two five mil Embossed
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic and that gets us through two years
just fine You don't have that much cost
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved in keeping them for a second year
because so much of your cost is up front
[SPEAKER_00]: and Typically what you'll do if you want
to do that is move them after fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't we do recommend The growers don't
try for a third harvest year and
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently folks will get through their
second year and think they have plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look pretty good but they almost always
get into trouble during that third year
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll explain to you a little bit why
we sometimes have yield decreases in the
[SPEAKER_00]: second year and why we definitely will
have yield decreases in the third year if
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at how a strawberry plant grows
Okay, the crown area is basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed stem and you will have new
roots growing right out of this area right
[SPEAKER_00]: where The crown area so you'll see some of
these new roots that are coming out higher
[SPEAKER_00]: and higher on the crown as as time goes by
As new leaves are produced this stem will
[SPEAKER_00]: become longer And taller and so what
happens is as it gets higher as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: basically gets higher out of the ground
You do end up with more problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: winter injury And then besides that we
often end up with some problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect and disease buildup you may end up
with additional branch crowns and some
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller berries on them But again,
if you keep the nutrition up there You
[SPEAKER_00]: know you that yield decreases into a
definite in the second year now a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: questions Can you wait till the plants go
dormant in the fall and snip off runners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since start them in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that would be a little
Difficult to do You could you could give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a try, but I really doubt that the
plants would would go that long Because if
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are dormant in the fall You're
still going to have a fairly vegetative,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know runner there And I really think
it'd be a little difficult to keep them in
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough shape Until the springtime
even even a period of three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be a little difficult to
do Marv if you can If you would care to
[SPEAKER_00]: wave weigh in on any thoughts on that one
I'd appreciate your thoughts there and yes
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard's comment on Oriental beetle that
seems to be more of a problem the further
[SPEAKER_00]: East you go we've also had some problems
with strawberry rootworm is one where
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had an issue with in in carrying
plantings over All righty and one other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing growers will ask about typically
you'll put on a fall row cover if You do
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to go with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall with fall planted or well late summer
or early fall planted plug plants And you
[SPEAKER_00]: are delayed You know, what do you do in
that situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible to put a fall row cover on
fairly early Typically we will say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll apply a row cover when the
temperatures when the high temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day Are either in the high 60s or
low 70s day after day You can move that up
[SPEAKER_00]: by a few weeks And and try to get a little
more growth on the plants and adjust so
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So Marv's comment dig them in the
fall and plant them in the spring that
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be You know Basically,
yeah, the runner tips just just may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you would want to go on that but
dormant plants Might be a be a way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there So thank you Marv fall row cover
application Just coming back to that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do put it on early and I mean by two
to three weeks Ahead of when you normally
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect your temperatures to your
daytime highs to be in the high 60s or low
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s If you put the row covers on two to
three weeks ahead of that you can make up
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of the yield loss by Planting the
plants or plug plants late, but you just
[SPEAKER_00]: never make make back the old loss
completely The one other thing I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: point out is if you do that for some
reason it does advance the spring harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: season And that could be either good or
bad There's just this carryover effect
[SPEAKER_00]: from putting row cover on in September
that carries over and makes the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: actually bloom Earlier in the springtime
and that's that was something that
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised us a little bit I also just want
to throw out the possibility of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: day neutrals on plastic just because We've
been doing work with them for about the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three years And they seem to really
really work well on plastic seascape in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular And so you know if you do have
an interest in growing day neutrals or you
[SPEAKER_00]: and you think you have a market for them
hum for offseason berries You know
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Day neutrals work as well,
so this isn't a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only for June bearers Do jay
neutrals day neutrals also work well in
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels and which Lewis will be talking
about in a in a little while So row
[SPEAKER_00]: protection I'd mentioned our cold
temperatures some choices you can hope for
[SPEAKER_00]: a consistent roe cover that may not May
not do this It looks like there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are growing the The day neutrals
I want to take a couple questions here You
[SPEAKER_00]: know our market for day neutrals really
seems to vary with who is growing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are located Some people have
had you know have Been able to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they can produce others You
know are having trouble moving them,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just seems to depend on the situation
Yes the for day neutrals we actually are
[SPEAKER_00]: planting the plants in the springtime And
with what we ended up doing was using
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant plants we plugged them ourselves
in April planted them in May and then
[SPEAKER_00]: could get good yields off of them for that
first summer and then We would carry them
[SPEAKER_00]: over for a second year and get the
production off for the following
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime after that the size just
decreased too much to really be happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Just the production after that
point We were just getting a lot of small
[SPEAKER_00]: berries when we were getting into the
second half of our second year on plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay coming back to our plastic culture
the winter protection and we do want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use row covers if you're in a fairly warm
area meaning You know Hardiness zone 6a 6b
[SPEAKER_00]: or slightly warmer than that if you get
into cooler areas It seems that straw does
[SPEAKER_00]: does help a lot with getting the plants
through the winter Just putting straw on
[SPEAKER_00]: top alone hasn't worked that well for us
It seems to work for some other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just had difficulty with it blowing
off and maybe it's just our our lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent snow cover to hold it down and
and the fact that we have A windy site
[SPEAKER_00]: where our research plantings are what's
worked better for us is using straw
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath a row cover I do want to point
out that when you put straw on a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: culture planting at that point You don't
really get any you know light into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant anymore Pretty much it you know
brings any plant activity to a halt there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but We'll put this straw on later than we
put on a matted row planting Normally we
[SPEAKER_00]: will pull our row covers on during the
fall to get that get some increased
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and plant growth During the
fall and that raises the soil temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's going to be later that the
plants are going dormant So we are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have always been very close to
Christmas by the time we put our straw on
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're really talking the end of
December to do that and So what we will
[SPEAKER_00]: end up doing is actually putting the row
cover on for the fall pulling it off
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting the straw down and then pulling
the row cover back over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do want the plants to Be fully
dormant when you do this, so they should
[SPEAKER_00]: you know have that reddish color to them
be a bit flattened Underneath the row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover before you do that Okay,
so the other issue frost protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's not just a northern thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's anywhere It's a problem
everywhere, but what's really worked well
[SPEAKER_00]: for us is either using overhead irrigation
And we'll actually put the irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinklers on over top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one of the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right down through There over top
of the row cover and the advantage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: is you can use the row cover for a lot of
the fast protection And it's only really
[SPEAKER_00]: once the temperature reaches close to
freezing underneath the row cover that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to turn on the overhead irrigation So
that's cut the amount of your overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation we need to about half of what
would need if we didn't have the row cover
[SPEAKER_00]: and You can also use a double layer of row
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've gone to the last few
years our thickness on the Straw layer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want that to be same as in a matted
row planting about four to six inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffed straw Over top of the over top of
the plants So let's say we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move on so what are our options for making
plastic culture work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the northeastern cooler regions
Using plug plants if they're available
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly is good, but if you can get them
early enough But you know like say there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some issues with that and dormant
plants is the other option Carrying them
[SPEAKER_00]: over for a second harvest year seems to
work well consistently And then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also do plastic culture in high tunnels,
but there you get into more costs And
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll let Lewis get into To that a little
bit, so I just want to do basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: brief review of what we would what we do
And some of the things that we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about to get a plastic culture planning to
work In some cooler areas, you know you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start out with your food You'll do the
soil test do all the things you would for
[SPEAKER_00]: any planting Except we'll normally work in
about 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre Which
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little higher than what we recommend
for matted row production Make our raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds in spring early summer sometime ahead
of time so that you have those ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and then plant dormant plants Mid-july
works well for us and need to adjust that
[SPEAKER_00]: for other regions the further north you go
Seems to you seem to need to go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier Further south you can go a little
later Or use plug plants and you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: those from either tips That you root
yourself or from dormant plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-august or tips that if you can get
them from a nursery Go through removing
[SPEAKER_00]: runners keeping the planning water apply
row covers in the fall once temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: your highs get You know not out of the low
70s apply straw mulch To get them through
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter in addition to the row cover
Covers and then in the springtime you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take the straw off when your soil
temperature is right around 40 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Same time base not same time same stage of
plant growth as you might have in a matted
[SPEAKER_00]: row planting just if you start to see the
plants starting to grow it's time to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the straw off and Then you'll leave your
row cover there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull the row cover back on if you
want to advance harvest You can leave row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover off if you want to delay your
harvest But definitely you'll want to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: your row cover back on for frost
protection I'm heavy overhead irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start fertigating through the
trickle system One to two pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per week seems to well work well
for us Go through harvest if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry them over for a second year You can
basically mow the leaves off the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's all you'll do but then keep
them watered Resume some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation to get them get them going you
won't need row covers for that second fall
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you should have plenty of plant
growth out there already But you will want
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect them for the winter and then
you just continue once you get You know
[SPEAKER_00]: into that second winter Then you'll just
you know go on through with removing straw
[SPEAKER_00]: the following spring and harvesting and
that's it in a nutshell, so If people
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't mind I think we're gonna hold the
questions till the very end just to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we have plenty of Opportunity
for Lewis to speak and Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great Let me just quickly change
these Pods here and put Lewis's
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation up
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd like to introduce our second
speaker today Lewis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Lewis Jed is the associate professor
of horticulture and the extension
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist for vegetables and small fruits
at the University of West Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's also done a lot of work in
Missouri He had a handout that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: available for you folks at the very last
portion of our Session and that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: download onto your own computer And I'll
make sure to point that out to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then one other thing that I forgot to
share with everyone Let me just see if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can make sure to Show this if you can
follow my cursor if you go to full screen
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of us for those of us who like
to see the screen really big I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: enable you to change it yourself so each
one of you can push full screen and make
[SPEAKER_01]: it take up the screen and then you Don't
look at the attendee list or the chat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's up to you to do to do that
Okay, without further ado I'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce dr. Jet Okay, thank you Laura I
appreciate you inviting me for this
[SPEAKER_02]: webinar series on strawberry production
and I mostly work with vegetables in high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels, but the small fruits are a new
area that we've been we've been looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: and So I want to cover some of the
integrated crop management techniques that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would typically Use if you're if
you're growing strawberries within a high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel I think many of you know what a
high tunnel is but for those of you who?
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't encountered one of these
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really just an advanced way to
extend the growing season and Typically
[SPEAKER_02]: through the Northeast the New England
Mid-Atlantic region.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a major adoption of this type of
technology to lengthen the growing season
[SPEAKER_02]: and to exclude pests particularly organic
growers find them a great tool for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: crops organically without pesticide use or
limited pesticide use and Here in the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mid-Atlantic region in West Virginia and
even in the Midwest where I was at before
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to extend the growing season
on most crops by three months But if you
[SPEAKER_02]: be really creative with these high
tunnels, you can actually get three crops
[SPEAKER_02]: within a 12 month period So you're you're
able to grow a lot of food in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: limited space in a in a year, so that's
Certain reason why they're becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let you grow crops that you normally
couldn't grow at your Latitude or your
[SPEAKER_02]: region and so it opens the door for
growing crops Out of their traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: season and even varieties that may be
sensitive to cold weather By putting them
[SPEAKER_02]: in a high tunnel to protecting them from
extreme cold and you're able to grow them
[SPEAKER_02]: much farther north than what you normally
could and then finally they're they're
[SPEAKER_02]: used to supplement field production so
many Many growers who use these high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels use them mostly for early season
production sometimes late season
[SPEAKER_02]: production But they're also complementing
what they're also growing in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just a continual Supply of food
over a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why they have Been rapidly
adopted and there are many shapes and
[SPEAKER_02]: designs on high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so many permutations on size and
and In wall designs and and whatever but
[SPEAKER_02]: but generally they are a solar greenhouse
You're trapping them Radiant energy from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Sun and you're using that to as I said
to advance the growth of the crop and
[SPEAKER_02]: generally most people Define a high
tunnels claim they only have one or should
[SPEAKER_02]: have only one layer of plastic But I think
the farther north you go a double layer of
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic on a high tunnel Is a great
benefit So, you know, you could either
[SPEAKER_02]: have one or a double layer of plastic with
the structure so what they what they also
[SPEAKER_02]: do is I said accumulate heat over time and
this is just a temperature graph of a high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel versus ambient This happens to
actually be one of our strawberry High
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels and without looking at the Actual
numbers what we found is just a single
[SPEAKER_02]: layer a plastic high tunnel Increases the
average daily temperature from seven to
[SPEAKER_02]: ten degrees per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's fairly significant for
for crop growth over time We did a survey
[SPEAKER_02]: on what is grown in high tunnels and these
are some of the most popular crops I Think
[SPEAKER_02]: most of you probably would expect crops
like tomatoes and salad greens to be
[SPEAKER_02]: widely grown high tunnels because they're
high Volume long season crops with high
[SPEAKER_02]: value, but strawberries are becoming a
popular crop For high tunnels and also
[SPEAKER_02]: other small foods such as brambles,
which I think will be discussed a little
[SPEAKER_02]: later on in this this webinar series So
there's a question on finding a a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonably priced temperature monitoring
system Well the one that we are using to
[SPEAKER_02]: monitor temperature is just a Either a
watchdog or a What they call a hobo data
[SPEAKER_02]: logger and they can log temperature for
you and we also use wireless thermometers
[SPEAKER_02]: to to Monitor temperature, so I'm not
quite sure the price differences between
[SPEAKER_02]: those there's different Different types,
but as I'll talk about later temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: management these high tunnels is crucial
because One of the benefits as I as I said
[SPEAKER_02]: is accumulating heat But they're also
manually vented so it's up to the operator
[SPEAKER_02]: to control temperature as much as possible
So it can either be a too hot or too cold
[SPEAKER_02]: and that could actually be detrimental to
the particular crop So we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about strawberries, and I think
strawberries are perfect crop for high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels mainly because They are an early
season crop and I Preached to my growers
[SPEAKER_02]: here in West, Virginia That we need more
supply of early season crops and berries
[SPEAKER_02]: fit very well within that that mix the big
question is whether they're profitable to
[SPEAKER_02]: be grown in a high tunnel and That depends
on a couple factors, which I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: a little later on as farmers markets open
earlier There is a strong demand for
[SPEAKER_02]: berries So early season berries There is a
premium price for them Not quite as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as there is for early season tomatoes,
but it is fairly fairly profitable so why
[SPEAKER_02]: grow high tunnel strawberries well I
Recommend that whenever you choose a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow in your high tunnel And there are
there are scores of props that you can can
[SPEAKER_02]: produce in the high tunnel it depends on
your Your particular market, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: really two things two criteria that I look
at when I when I choose a crop and it has
[SPEAKER_02]: to have high value and also high high
volume or high yield potential and There
[SPEAKER_02]: are some crops that have high value,
but don't yield much per plant and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's sort of a problem So remember those
two criteria as we as we go along we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about this crop Now a lot of growers who
adopt high tunnels on their farm as I said
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier with the survey use it for
tomatoes tomatoes grow vertically They
[SPEAKER_02]: yield a lot of fruit per plant There's a
high there's a high price for early season
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes, so Maybe eight out of ten high
tunnel producers grow tomatoes either
[SPEAKER_02]: either entirely in the high tunnel or in
combination with other crops in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels the strawberries could possibly be
a good crop rotation choice for tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: or complement tomato production in the
high tunnel Kathy mentioned different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of strawberries the day neutrals and
the short date or June bearer types Most
[SPEAKER_02]: of my work and experience with growers has
been with the June bearers although.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the farther north you go The day
neutral types have tremendous potential We
[SPEAKER_02]: have just started a project this year with
growing day neutrals and in in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels I don't have the data compiled yet
But I think particularly these types of
[SPEAKER_02]: crop these types of strawberries that do
well in cooler weather Would be very well
[SPEAKER_02]: suited to farther north such as the day
neutral types Okay One thing that I I
[SPEAKER_02]: highly recommend when you grow any crop in
the high tunnel is is to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the soil tested prior to planting
the straw the strawberries in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel and this is just a picture of kind
of hard to maybe see what it is exactly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but
[SPEAKER_02]: This area through here that the white the
white area The crusty area is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of salt deposits that build up in the
high tunnel from repeated Fertigation of
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of fertilizers,
and I've had a lot of growers Have
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about that whether that is you
know causing the salt levels in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: to be very high and so we recently tested
this soil and The salt levels are very
[SPEAKER_02]: high right around the emitters,
but the rest of the soil does not have
[SPEAKER_02]: very high salt levels the reason I
mentioned this is Strawberries are very
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are they will show They will show
damage You see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will show damage to the tissue From
salt injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would picture that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is salt damage to to strawberries
some of the marginal necrosis on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves that you see here and So if you're
putting down a lot of fertilizers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: high tunnels particularly ammonium nitrate
or urea You could have a salt build up or
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're using certain animal based
Compost animal manure based compost you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have high salts too, so just something
to to be aware of so have your compost
[SPEAKER_02]: tested As I showed earlier this is Compost
that we put in our high tunnel or one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our high tunnels as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an animal manure based compost and
Again like I said it's important to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that test either at the local State land
grant soil testing lab or private lab Is
[SPEAKER_02]: there a difference between ever bearing
and day neutral strawberries I think yes
[SPEAKER_02]: There is I know Marvin Pritz would have a
better answer for that than I would but
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the varieties you know that we
have looked at have been strictly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think day neutral types the ever bearer
types Which are still
[SPEAKER_01]: Does everybody hear Lewis now I lost him
there for a second, and I I think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: okay now
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing to remember is if you are
using compost if you are Inclined to use
[SPEAKER_02]: more organic amendments is to have the
compost tested Not only as I said for
[SPEAKER_02]: salts, but also for pH and other other
nutrients most compost is one to two
[SPEAKER_02]: percent Nitrogen it can be very high in
potassium and sometimes phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the source and surprising to
some Folks it can have also very high pH
[SPEAKER_02]: so using a too much compost can actually
create problems for crops like
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, so But you can also use
synthetic fertilizers to amend the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: now when we we grow crops in the high
tunnel The crop is grown directly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil under the structure now I I have
nothing against using soulless mixes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know there's some folks here that
use the compost bags and Which I think
[SPEAKER_02]: have great potential Particularly if you
can't move the high tunnel, or you aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: able to leach The soil in the high tunnel
enough through natural rainfall,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I see some potential for using soulless
systems in high tunnels And I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely rule them out although you know
the majority of growers are using the the
[SPEAKER_02]: native soil underneath the structure to
grow the crop and if possible the
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry should be placed on raised
beds, and these are these can be made
[SPEAKER_02]: manually which we have a lot of growers do
and then they There are some companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that sell a compact bed shaper,
which makes a really nice Crown bed that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can you can plant on in the high
tunnel so similar to this Or you can use a
[SPEAKER_02]: flat flat row system, but generally I like
to use raised bed the optimal planting
[SPEAKER_02]: date is really dependent upon your region
of the country and You know I could say
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult to generalize with
there's so many different different folks
[SPEAKER_02]: here on the in the meeting But I think the
one way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe as a rule of thumb is to look at
your your your field planning day and The
[SPEAKER_02]: high tunnel gives you almost an extra
month, so your planning window is expanded
[SPEAKER_02]: by three maybe perhaps four weeks Over
what your your field planning date is for
[SPEAKER_02]: these these particular types of
strawberries So that's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: why you know people like high tunnel
production is it gives you just a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: window To to get your crops planted So as
Cathy was saying if it's difficult to get
[SPEAKER_02]: plugs that early in August and early
August or even late July in some regions
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the high tunnel you have a longer
planting window you can perhaps get plugs
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit later in the year,
so But the problem is if you plant too
[SPEAKER_02]: late she mentioned you just don't get the
Vegetative growth and the flyer bud
[SPEAKER_02]: initiation in the fall and your yields are
dramatically reduced so Sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_02]: trial and error and I know some folks
maybe in your region have been doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: research with planning dates And that's
that's probably something you should look
[SPEAKER_02]: at Different planning arrangements on high
tunnel strawberries go the two row bed or
[SPEAKER_02]: more, but if you Using a two row bed We
recommend putting on two two lines of drip
[SPEAKER_02]: tape on the on the bed so for every row of
berries you have in the high tunnel you
[SPEAKER_02]: should have one row of drip tape because
Again, you're protecting the crop from
[SPEAKER_02]: rain and the crops entirely dependent upon
you for water So you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're providing enough water
nutrients to the crop so Particularly if
[SPEAKER_02]: you move to a three or four row bed on
strawberries you need to have you know
[SPEAKER_02]: three to four drip lines per bed So
anyway, that's that's typical planning
[SPEAKER_02]: arrangement there some growers have tried
four row beds and We have tried it as well
[SPEAKER_02]: in some of our research The problem you
get into with these high tunnels is that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at two to three thousand
square feet in the high tunnel Or if you
[SPEAKER_02]: move to a haygrove System where you have
you know multiple bays you can have a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger area But the the inclination is to
crowd plants in there, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a mistake Because you can get more
production From less from an optimal plant
[SPEAKER_02]: population than you could by just really
packing plants in tight So that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: found with the four row bed on
strawberries is that you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: you're paying you're paying more for for
extra plants But you're not getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: extra yield So we have found a two or
three row bed to be optimal for for
[SPEAKER_02]: planting in these these these structures
Okay, so how many plants can you can you
[SPEAKER_02]: get in there you can get anywhere from
1,500 to 2,000 strawberry plants per
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial high tunnel And this would be a
typical spacing I sort of like to go
[SPEAKER_02]: almost equidistant between plants and
between rows 12 to 15 inches between
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and and the same the same distance
between rows on the bed and sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: typical staggered planning arrangement
like this and I think that would be ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: With the bed can be anywhere from 24
inches to as wide as almost 40 42 inches
[SPEAKER_02]: wide This is a four row bed with three
drip lines per bed and the plants are very
[SPEAKER_02]: crowded in there, and it's led to Louis
could I Louis excuse me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chautauqua County has a question that I
think is pretty pertinent about how big is
[SPEAKER_01]: that tunnel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the measurements of the
tunnel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well most of the tunnels that we've been
working with or using our research are 20
[SPEAKER_02]: to 30 feet wide and 96 feet long,
so that's a typical okay Thank you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it looks like you might be
Starting to talk about Sue Guize's
[SPEAKER_01]: questions talking about substrate systems
that she asked and it looks like you might
[SPEAKER_02]: touch on that now Well Yeah, I just my
only comments about it is I mean we have
[SPEAKER_02]: just started this year growing
strawberries in Elevated gutters,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't have data to share on that but
you know there's some interest in sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: the vertical growing systems in these high
tunnels and I think there's a potential
[SPEAKER_02]: there But there have been some problems
with with yield per plant so someone needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to really work up a design where there's
less Shading by individual plants and the
[SPEAKER_02]: yield levels are high You know from top to
bottom there was a recent article in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable growers news I believe it was in
the June issue where the grower up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan was was looking at vertical
growing systems and actually he's designed
[SPEAKER_02]: A system he thinks works But I think
that's some of the issues that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at in the future is growing these
plants More vertically getting more plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and also getting higher yield per plant
Because if you're just growing it just in
[SPEAKER_02]: a flat system in this in the soil as I
said you can get a fixed optimal number of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but At some point your yield level
has to be high enough to make it proper
[SPEAKER_02]: Capital cost per square foot of a high
tunnel Generally there are two to three
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars per square foot Is generally what
the average and there's like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of variance in that estimate
too because Depending on whether it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: Manufactured high tunnel or a homemade
high tunnel The cost can be can be pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty wide But what a lot of our growers
have been doing and I think it might be
[SPEAKER_02]: the case throughout the northeast is
probably Coaching old greenhouse frames
[SPEAKER_02]: from nurseries or greenhouse businesses
that are going out of out of business and
[SPEAKER_02]: then using those frames for high tunnels
and all they have to do is just add a A
[SPEAKER_02]: hip board to it so that they can roll up
the sides and get cross ventilation So
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I think it depends like I said on a
30 by 96 high tunnel the the one that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are about ready Plastic on in about two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably cost around seven thousand
dollars with every every component to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Again like I said that that that that
price varies depending on the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_02]: The varieties that you can choose from are
You know they're fairly wide group of
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties these particular varieties are
ones that are bred primarily For
[SPEAKER_02]: plasticulture of course you're probably
familiar with most most of these Chandler
[SPEAKER_02]: Camarosa and Sweet Charlie and Ventana and
even festival those are the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've grown in the high tunnels But I I
think there's a there's a lot of potential
[SPEAKER_02]: for other short day varieties that Cathy
mentioned such as the Wendy Lamour
[SPEAKER_02]: Darselect and the Seneca as Varieties that
could be potentially later than these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties and so a mix of these varieties
plus some of those other Juneberry
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties Could give you a longer
production season, but our our most
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent variety has been Chandler And I
know it's been Tried and tested in many
[SPEAKER_02]: regions of the country, but it seems
that's not Chandler in the picture there
[SPEAKER_02]: That's festival actually, but it seems to
have consistently high yields and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor that most growers like for for
local markets, so but I think the The
[SPEAKER_02]: other varieties that were mentioned could
certainly compliment Chandler as varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: to add to your high tunnel so the the
reason I mentioned Plants Yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just noting the comment on using the
old hoop houses that were modified I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that certainly is the way to To
start in the high tunnel production is to
[SPEAKER_02]: is to recycle frames as much as possible
and And then that way you can you can
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly cut the startup costs because
they're immediately profitable and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: recover your costs within a year and then
if you want to You know purchase a brand
[SPEAKER_02]: new frame the following year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly would have the money to do
it Just sort of adding on to what Cathy
[SPEAKER_02]: was saying about plants for for growing
strawberries or plant sources or plant
[SPEAKER_02]: types I mentioned this because the single
biggest production cost of growing
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries in high tunnel is plant costs
So you have some choices here on different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of plants that you can that you can
use you can buy your own runner tips and
[SPEAKER_02]: group the plugs yourself and Or you can
get bare root plants Or you can get plugs
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to plant and we've done all three so
the most economical It's probably going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be rooting your own runner tips if you can
get runner tips in time But like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: because your planting windows have been
expanded by the use of the high tunnel you
[SPEAKER_02]: have more time to get plant material for
the for your high tunnel structure Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are some strawberry plant suppliers
Laura had mentioned the handout that I I
[SPEAKER_02]: have that accompanies this presentation
that all this is is listed within that in
[SPEAKER_02]: that handout Well, okay, the question was
two thousand plants one pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries per plant In the ground for
four to six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's approximately correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean One pound per plant it should be
your base Your base yield that should be
[SPEAKER_02]: the yield that you should at least get if
you're not getting a pound per plant The
[SPEAKER_02]: economics just don't Don't work out for
high tunnel strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should be somewhere in the one and
a half pound range I believe That actually
[SPEAKER_02]: with some of these day neutral types,
although they have a longer Production
[SPEAKER_02]: season longer picking season.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually get close to two pounds
per plant But for these June bearer types,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be getting at least a pound and
we're for this to cash flow And to to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it profitable for high tunnels because for
every crop that you choose in a high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel There's another there's another
crop choice that can replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to be profitable for that to
be a good choice Just the cycle on growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants in the in the in the high
tunnel structure Generally for the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that I mentioned earlier such as
Chandler and Camarosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're planted in the fall and the
planting date could be anywhere from Late
[SPEAKER_02]: July through mid September and depending
on your on your region, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: planted They grow through the fall the
high tunnel keeps them warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put on good vegetative growth they
develop branch crowns and then row covers
[SPEAKER_02]: are sort of interesting to use in a high
tunnel because There really is no exact
[SPEAKER_02]: formula for using them like what Kathy was
saying with the field field production
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually by using row covers in high
tunnels, you can get you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: very early flowering on some of these
varieties and Some of these varieties such
[SPEAKER_02]: as sweet Charlie have a very shallow
dormancy or no dormancy at all And so they
[SPEAKER_02]: will actually flower in January or
February if if it if it's warm enough so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can lose Production because of early
flowering so you don't want to put the row
[SPEAKER_02]: cover On these high tunnel strawberries
too early And we use a medium weight To
[SPEAKER_02]: heavyweight row cover, which is one ounce
one and a quarter ounce Row cover we find
[SPEAKER_02]: that to be most effective but I Think I
think I can speak generally and say that
[SPEAKER_02]: you shouldn't use a row cover in a high
tunnel before December I think that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a pretty safe thing to say now We
have used it in our projects Primarily for
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme freeze protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the if the ambient temperature was
going to get Below 20 Fahrenheit we would
[SPEAKER_02]: be using row covers for protection on that
But we would not keep the row covers on
[SPEAKER_02]: that on the strawberries continually And
we would use it the following spring when
[SPEAKER_02]: They begin to flower so for frost
protection so We were sort of using it
[SPEAKER_02]: intermittently through the through the
season So again, like I said, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to use it Use it too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of growers use either the floating
row cover or will use a low tunnel,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is supported by hoops and Either way
is it can be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you do get more heat built up
with a low tunnel Versus just a floating
[SPEAKER_02]: row cover Okay Now generally when the
plants are going into dormancy in December
[SPEAKER_02]: in the high tunnel You know, they sort of
flatten out and we'd like to see about
[SPEAKER_02]: four to five branch crowns on the
strawberries and the diameter of the
[SPEAKER_02]: rosette should be about five to six inches
in length and that's a good You know
[SPEAKER_02]: starting point for how How your plants
should be going into dormancy problem that
[SPEAKER_02]: we had last year with a lot of growers is
they We had a very cloudy fall and we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get a lot of Growth in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yields were much lower this year for a
lot of growers So that that is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be a problem in certain areas
If you plant too early in the high tunnel
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get runner production And that's
something that you don't want on plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: because these these plants are grown on
plastic mulch under a plastic cover And
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no place for the runners to root
and you're not creating a matted row So
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to just have one central?
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant producing large fruit from
five Five branch crowns roughly ten
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers per branch crown, but no daughter
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll need to pull those daughter
plants off Probably a good indication that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're keeping your high tunnel too warm
is you're getting you're getting runner
[SPEAKER_02]: production so That that would be an
indication of a poor temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: management Which leads me into this issue
of temperature management the high tunnel
[SPEAKER_02]: because this always surprises growers at
how much time they have to spend adjusting
[SPEAKER_02]: the vents in these structures,
so you see the vents on on these high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels on the side and You know you
Generally want to keep the high tunnel on
[SPEAKER_02]: the cool side for strawberries because
they are a cool season crop so You know in
[SPEAKER_02]: days where it might get warm in the late
fall or even winter days where the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature can get warm You know you may
need to vent so Rolling up the sides is
[SPEAKER_02]: not a bad thing to do even in the middle
of winter Is there more heat accumulation
[SPEAKER_02]: under high tunnels or low tunnels well The
thing about that is using low tunnels
[SPEAKER_02]: within high tunnels Is extremely effective
so I mean you're going to get it's sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: You know sooner synergism between the two
that you get even more if you had a low
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel out in the field You know they do
increase the the air temperature around
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant But eventually they they reach
the ambient temperature much faster than
[SPEAKER_02]: what a high tunnel would but when you put
them in a high tunnel You almost double
[SPEAKER_02]: the effectiveness of the row cover,
so You know that's that's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: advantages of using low tunnels within
within high tunnels Okay, so also as I say
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're if you're not venting your high
tunnel adequately you can get premature
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering on some of these varieties and
The flowers are immediately frozen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's lost yield from the plant There
are some growers that that will use backup
[SPEAKER_02]: heaters in high tunnels for a lot of crops
and The backup heaters that are used for
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries are only used for frost
protection But generally if you use row
[SPEAKER_02]: covers if you put your row cover on early
enough in the day before it gets Cold at
[SPEAKER_02]: night you can trap enough heat under the
row cover within the high tunnel to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent Damage from frost or a light
freeze its temperatures got down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: teens if you had a single layer of plastic
You would need a backup here to prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: damage Okay, so Then take routine tissue
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend that that's done
primarily at first flowering the following
[SPEAKER_02]: spring and We take about 20 Leaf and
petiole samples per variety per high
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel that's usually enough to get you a
test and you can send it to either your
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnostic or your soil plant nutrition
lab on campus or Through a private lab
[SPEAKER_02]: this Pollination is an issue on on
strawberries and a lot of crops within
[SPEAKER_02]: high tunnels because the flowering is so
early That a lot of the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators aren't active yet,
so A lot of in our case in the Midlantic
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Midwest These high tunnel
strawberries would start flowering in mid
[SPEAKER_02]: to late March Well, that's usually well
before most natural pollinators become
[SPEAKER_02]: become available So the strawberries need
to get pollinated either by air movement
[SPEAKER_02]: or by bringing in pollinators yourself so
The question was couldn't overhead
[SPEAKER_02]: sprinklers be used for frost protection in
high tunnel Yeah, I suppose they could
[SPEAKER_02]: although I Really haven't used a lot of
overhead watering in the high tunnel Most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the watering is done through drip
irrigation, but that certainly is one One
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that you can do I suppose if you
could keep the water from freezing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic or anything like that that would
cause any damage to the to the Polly or
[SPEAKER_02]: the structure like that So to solve the
pollination Issue you can purchase a class
[SPEAKER_02]: C hive which has two or three hundred
drones in it and or you can actually get
[SPEAKER_02]: small new boxes of honeybees, but the
Bumblebees are very effective pollinators
[SPEAKER_02]: for for strawberries And if you don't get
good pollination or if the temperature is
[SPEAKER_02]: very cool when it's a winter flower,
and you can often get misshapen fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Something you don't want you want
good quality uniform fruit such as this is
[SPEAKER_02]: all high tunnel strawberries that you're
seeing now and the frequency of harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: generally for these these June bearing
types That you're looking at about a for a
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me a six to ten week period of
harvest, but if you if you Include day
[SPEAKER_02]: neutrals in you can you can certainly
extend that some things to consider on
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not running out of time on the pest
management is spider mites and petritis
[SPEAKER_02]: gray mold Spider mite is the most chronic
problem We've had with growing
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries in high tunnels, and this is
some typical symptoms of spider mites
[SPEAKER_02]: usually they develop within a specific
Area the hot spot usually the center of
[SPEAKER_02]: the high tunnel where it's warmest,
but we have been doing work with using
[SPEAKER_02]: predatory mites to control Spotted spider
mites in high tunnels, and it's been very
[SPEAKER_02]: effective the threshold is five five mites
per leaf And by using phytocelius,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a predatory mite we were able to
bring that threshold down to Bring that
[SPEAKER_02]: mite level down to below the threshold so
there's a perfect place to use predatory
[SPEAKER_02]: Insects or mites is the high tunnel
because you're an enclosed area you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: very small space and the the Insects or
mites work very effectively in those hot
[SPEAKER_02]: spots This is particularly a problem if
you're growing mixed crops in high tunnels
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a center row of strawberries here
and a lot of different types of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use predatory mites to control
Mites on not only strawberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also these other crops We've used lady
beetles to aphids are a problem if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: over fertilizing with nitrogen or if you
have too too much lush growth on the on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Plant this is petritis gray mold which
usually occurs your cloudy cool damp
[SPEAKER_02]: weather We like to remove all the dead
leaves as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is substrate for petritis So you want
to you want to keep those under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some weed growth that occurs
typically winter annual weeds such as
[SPEAKER_02]: chickweed occurs around the planting hole
that sometimes needs To be weeded one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our other serious problems is voles or
meadow mice and they will get underneath
[SPEAKER_02]: the plastic They'll overwinter in the high
tunnel and they'll actually chew on the
[SPEAKER_02]: crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So That's that's an issue to face in the
high tunnels, but you don't get deer
[SPEAKER_02]: damage like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So There's one advantage of the high
tunnels for strawberry growers is you do
[SPEAKER_02]: not get deer browsing on the So the yields
are 1.2 to 1.3 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to be around 1.5 pounds per per
plant If you can get that yield level and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get a price of three to four
dollars per pound Which is what most
[SPEAKER_02]: growers have been getting high tunnel
strawberries can be very profitable But
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to get that yield level and you
have to get that price range If you look
[SPEAKER_02]: at the handout, it has all the production
costs and the different Returns for
[SPEAKER_02]: different prices and yields on
strawberries that you can look at and see
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're actually making a profit so I
will close it there and Certainly want to
[SPEAKER_02]: visit me to the Cornell high tunnel
website and our high tunnel website that
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of accumulates information from a lot
of different Lewis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank thank you very much And I appreciate
I'm sorry to have to kind of move this
[SPEAKER_01]: along but we have a limited time and I
what I'm going to do here We're moving
[SPEAKER_01]: into the final aspect of the talk There
are three poles that I'd love if people
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to give some response to this
information While we finish up and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: the file share the upper right corner are
several different One is the handout that
[SPEAKER_01]: was sent to you in advance from Kathy
Demchak and then the other two are similar
[SPEAKER_01]: but slightly different Handouts from dr.
Lewis jet about high tunnel growing and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can upload those to your own computer
The other thing I want to remind everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: of is on Tuesday September 22nd we have a
insect strawberry insect pest discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Richard Coles from the University of
Connecticut and dr. Greg Lowe from Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University are going to be talking about
root weevils and sap beetle and tarnished
[SPEAKER_01]: plant bug respectively and I Do hope all
of you will get that announcement for
[SPEAKER_01]: connection and if you can make it
wonderful If you can't just disregard the
[SPEAKER_01]: announcement, but we decided to start
sending because we're getting so much
[SPEAKER_01]: activity for the registration It was just
easier to keep all of you in one list and
[SPEAKER_01]: send it out But before we log off if
anybody else has any questions for either
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy Demchak or Lewis jet We could take
those now just for a couple of extra
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes I know there was one question that
was asked several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the difference between?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Kathy answered that great no real
difference for between day neutral and
[SPEAKER_01]: ever bearing Possibly day neutral might
not be quite correct and Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: all it is is really the day neutrals
aren't really day neutrals and Right now
[SPEAKER_00]: there seems to be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm all repeat flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone else have okay Heather Bryant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the optimum pH for growing
strawberries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do either of you I can okay good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what I was going to say Is there
any other questions it looks like a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: people are typing rapidly Gwyn Smith
forever bears if I want to overwinter do
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to be renovated like June
bearers?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not on plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep No any other questions looks like
people have stopped typing and most people
[SPEAKER_01]: have responded to the polls and I think
that's it then we made it just in the nick
[SPEAKER_01]: of time for the log off and I really want
to thank again The Northeast IPM Center
[SPEAKER_01]: for funding this series of webinars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Kathy Demchik of Penn
State University and Dr. Louis Jett from
