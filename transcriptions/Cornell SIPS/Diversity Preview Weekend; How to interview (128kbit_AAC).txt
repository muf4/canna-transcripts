[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Natalie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of the organizers of DPW.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're here, obviously, to talk about
interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have interviews this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are mock interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to give you tips on how to
actually do this when you get into this
[SPEAKER_04]: grad school application and the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see there's a lot of people at
the front of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm Natalie.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, I'm in ecology and evolutionary
biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these nice folks are going to
introduce themselves also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Jenny.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm a first year PhD student in soil
and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Cass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm a second year PhD student in
entomology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jenny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a second year PhD student in
ecology and evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Eugene.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a second year PhD in soil and crop
sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Lizzie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a third year PhD student in
ecology and evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably introduced myself several times
at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm John.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a third year in entomology,
PhD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these people are going to be
helping today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do some practice of what it
actually looks like to interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to hear about what a real
interview when you get to grad school
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a reminder, we've talked about the
fact that you're having interviews later
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't stress too much about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not expected to know all the
information about the people that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: interviewing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not judging you in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But today, we're going to talk about what
can help you in the next interviews that
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I said, we're going over a couple
different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're explaining what actually happens in
a grad school interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it different from other job
interviews that you might know of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very different thing than a job
interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: For what you might use when you sit down
at the beginning of that interview and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, oh, God, what am I going to
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I say?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I start?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you one tool that you can use
to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll go over some questions that
you might want to ask in interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big component of it, where people
want you to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get to know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make sure that you know what
you need to know for that program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've heard this many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're here as a resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be time for small group
discussions today in this workshop,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you can ask anything you want to
know about interviewing, save the other
[SPEAKER_04]: questions for the other workshops,
because you'll get so much more
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a cute picture I found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we talked about an interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often, they're like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get in there, and you're like,
what am I going to talk about now?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start with introducing yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we're calling an elevator pitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a quick summary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you excited about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're going to go with this feedback
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are those questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find out in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're in that discussion,
that interview where you're assessing the
[SPEAKER_04]: program, the school, you're also figuring
out whether you're a good match with that
[SPEAKER_04]: person.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big point of grad school is you want to
be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make sure that you get along
with a person that you would work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interview is the time where you're
face to face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really figure out, do our
personalities match?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I like this person?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I work with them?
[SPEAKER_04]: So ask the questions that you need to know
to answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also want to know, obviously,
about the science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that research topic that you're
interested in really engaging and active
[SPEAKER_04]: in that school, in that program,
and in that lab?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going quickly through this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you might be excited also.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will get into this more as we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to turn it over to Janani,
who's going to talk about what facts
[SPEAKER_04]: faculty expect.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I just want to go over really
quickly the expectations that faculty have
[SPEAKER_12]: from interviews, which is kind of this
golden black box question that I think we
[SPEAKER_12]: don't really know the answer to.
[SPEAKER_12]: At least, I didn't know the answer to when
I was interviewing for grad school.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did the best thing that we could
think of, and we went directly to the
[SPEAKER_12]: faculty themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we sent out a survey with these
questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you expect with students applying
to be in your lab?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you expect them to have done when
they want to be in your department?
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of skills or personality traits
do you expect them to display during
[SPEAKER_12]: interviews?
[SPEAKER_12]: So interestingly, most faculty do not
expect you to have published papers in
[SPEAKER_12]: that field or to have done any amount of
extensive research work in that field.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is for faculty whose labs you're
applying to be in.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do expect you to have read their
research website and be generally familiar
[SPEAKER_12]: with the area in which they work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's keep in mind that this is for
when you're actually interviewing in grad
[SPEAKER_12]: school, not for the mock interviews that
we will be having later today afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no need to go over faculty
websites we will be interviewing with
[SPEAKER_12]: today.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the future, that's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this changes a little bit when we ask
them, OK, so what about someone who's
[SPEAKER_12]: applying to be in your department,
but who doesn't necessarily want to work
[SPEAKER_12]: in your lab?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do your expectations change in that
case?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's still consistent.
[SPEAKER_12]: People do expect that you've looked over
their website, that you kind of know
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on in the field, that you
know the latest kind of happenings in the
[SPEAKER_12]: field.
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, nobody expects you to have read
their papers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody expects you to have worked in that
field.
[SPEAKER_12]: But very important, again, ask questions,
ask as many questions as you can think of,
[SPEAKER_12]: ask as many questions as you would like.
[SPEAKER_12]: People expect you to be curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: People expect you to be interested in what
their labs are doing, their programs are
[SPEAKER_12]: doing, their department is doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's key.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if you don't necessarily,
even if you're not necessarily interested
[SPEAKER_12]: in that person's work, ask questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Use that opportunity to gain more
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is what faculty had to say about
what they expect students interviewing
[SPEAKER_12]: with them to be like.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what skills can you cultivate or what
quality can you practice so that you can
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of deliver on these expectations?
[SPEAKER_12]: So from the same survey, these are kind of
the broad areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the personages here are basically the
number of faculty who said they would
[SPEAKER_12]: expect to see their students display these
qualities.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what was exciting to me here was that
qualities like intelligence, excitement,
[SPEAKER_12]: ability to talk about your research
interests.
[SPEAKER_12]: These were more important than things like
your GPA, your grades, and your test
[SPEAKER_12]: scores, which I personally think is very
promising, because as a graduate student,
[SPEAKER_12]: qualities like hard work and perseverance,
I think are way more important than this
[SPEAKER_12]: academic stereotype of someone who's
sitting in their ivory tower who comes up
[SPEAKER_12]: with these brilliant ideas.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's also interesting is that a lot of
faculty mentioned contribution to
[SPEAKER_12]: diversity and creating an inclusive
environment as important factors in hiring
[SPEAKER_12]: students and interviewing students.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that being said, a word of caution,
faculty may not always understand the
[SPEAKER_12]: place you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there could be instances in grad
school interviews where you may be asked
[SPEAKER_12]: inappropriate questions or incorrect
assumptions may be made about you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a host of different ways to
deal with this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could maybe talk about this a
little bit more during the debriefing or
[SPEAKER_12]: the question answer session.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you do have those questions or
concerns, again, feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all heard those questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're happy to talk to you about our
strategies.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've emphasized the importance of
asking questions, of being curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we did, and you should see these
in the handouts that we just passed on,
[SPEAKER_12]: we kind of compiled a bunch of different
questions that we think are really useful
[SPEAKER_12]: when it comes to interviews, things that
you should feel free to ask faculty about.
[SPEAKER_12]: Say if you find yourself stressing out,
you're panicking, you can't really think
[SPEAKER_12]: of anything off the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a list of questions ready for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to make it kind of easier to process,
we broke them down into three big areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Questions about the program, questions
about resources that are available to you
[SPEAKER_12]: as a graduate student, and then questions
about your social life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because this is an often overlooked aspect
of grad school.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you're going to be spending two
years or five years or six years in this
[SPEAKER_12]: place, and you need to survive.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to have a social network.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you will find more information on this
in the handout, really.
[SPEAKER_12]: But very quickly, so in terms of the
program, you can definitely ask faculty
[SPEAKER_12]: about their opinions about the program.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we think it's changed since they
joined the program?
[SPEAKER_12]: Where do they think it's heading?
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the strengths?
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the weaknesses of the program?
[SPEAKER_12]: Resources, talk about professional
development opportunities.
[SPEAKER_12]: The students go to conferences.
[SPEAKER_12]: The students get trained on presentation
skills, on grant writing skills.
[SPEAKER_12]: How active are students in leadership and
governance?
[SPEAKER_12]: All of these are important questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: How does funding work in the department?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because different universities,
different programs have very different
[SPEAKER_12]: funding situations.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some departments might expect you to teach
for a certain number of semesters or
[SPEAKER_12]: years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some might not.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's important to ask those questions
to know where your funding is coming from.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we're often hesitant as
graduate students because we feel like we
[SPEAKER_12]: don't have that position of power to ask
these questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's really important to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing about how long do students
take?
[SPEAKER_12]: To get their PhD or to get their master's
in this department.
[SPEAKER_12]: And is that timeline something you are
personally comfortable with?
[SPEAKER_12]: Social life, I would say read the room in
terms of faculty interviews.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these questions may be appropriate
to ask during interviews.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some may not.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe these will be more appropriate
during social events or when you're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking to graduate students.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can definitely ask about the
Graduate Student Association.
[SPEAKER_12]: How active is it?
[SPEAKER_12]: How much will you get to know about your
cohort, about the people you are in this
[SPEAKER_12]: program with?
[SPEAKER_12]: What about lab meetings?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the lab atmosphere like?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the lab culture like?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cost of living in that place?
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've asked about funding situation
already.
[SPEAKER_12]: How far will those type in take you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be able to afford rent?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be able to eat out once
in a while?
[SPEAKER_12]: All of these are great questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please don't hesitate to ask them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have any other questions that
you're not sure if they're appropriate or
[SPEAKER_12]: not, once again, talk to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm going to hand it back to Natalie
so we can get started on your elevator
[SPEAKER_12]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you walk into the room, this might be
the question you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might be like, oh, god,
like, what do I do with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And because all of us feel that,
literally every one standing in front of
[SPEAKER_04]: the room has been in that position,
we're going to model what it might look
[SPEAKER_04]: like for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to wait on passing
out the tool until after we model in the
[SPEAKER_04]: interest of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to turn it over to these
fine people to show you some examples of
[SPEAKER_04]: what it might look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already said this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, the hardest thing, even standing
in front of this room is relaxing enough
[SPEAKER_04]: not to just bounce all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably already know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to tell myself that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you do, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go over this in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll get more information after we
practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, in an elevator pitch like
this, you want to talk about what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing now, the present, what you've done
that led you to that point, the past,
[SPEAKER_04]: and what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get all of this in a
handout with more information about what
[SPEAKER_04]: might fit into each of these categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's important here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You notice you're a person with a whole
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really what they want to know in that
interview is, what's your history?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to do moving forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: So your future should connect to the
experiences that you are doing right now
[SPEAKER_04]: and that you've done previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anitra talked a lot about research
experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things that will help you to sort of
bolster your own past to prepare you for
[SPEAKER_04]: grad school.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where you actually share it one
on one in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come back to that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, though, I'm going to ask these
people, wonderful people, to model what an
[SPEAKER_04]: interview might look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene, who introduced himself,
is going to play the role of a professor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch Eugene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then three of these folks are going to
show you different elevator pitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to call on John first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene and John are going to give you this
really, really quick elevator pitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be one minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cut them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be fun for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my name's John.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a student at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, really passionate about
insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing my major in entomology.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to see bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I work with fruit flies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you need a lot of really cool
genetic stuff with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'm really actually interested in
are their microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think their microbes are fascinating.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microbes do so many cool things in
insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're way, way cooler things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there are these ants.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these ants.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They farm this fungus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're called leaf cutter ants.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't do any research on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I took a class.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I learned a lot about them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I feel like I'm an expert.
OK.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about these all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to go through them in a
rapid-fire fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: John, when?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Cass.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually out doing field work
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm covered in paint.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm working on collecting bees right now
in this weird way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm using bee bowls.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a, anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Cass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really excited about bees and
networks.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really interested both in,
like, the theoretical side.
[SPEAKER_09]: So wait.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go back a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you coming here from?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did my master's in a forestry school.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then before that, I was an undergrad.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did ecology and evolutionary.
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you familiar with the work of Dr.
Ruthie and I?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a big forestry name.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she does a lot of work in forests and
nutrient cycling and stuff like that.
Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is she based?
[SPEAKER_09]: At the SUNY Forestry School in Syracuse.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to meet her.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are, like, so quick on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny, your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jenny Yuling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm really interested in birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've loved them since I was about 10
years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I became interested in them in an
ecology and evolutionary biology
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective when I was starting as an
undergrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I graduated at the University of Chicago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, I worked on understanding the
distribution of non-native parrots in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing that, I used species
distribution modeling to understand what
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental factors influence
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really loved that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved thinking about birds in a wide
geographic distribution manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one aspect that was kind of missing
for me there was understanding how their
[SPEAKER_02]: movement is influencing their
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for my PhD work, I'm really interested
in focusing on movement and spatial
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology of birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also really interested in migration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the coolest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd love to focus on how birds make
decisions about movement and route as
[SPEAKER_02]: they're migrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I'm doing a gap year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been learning all of these
different techniques in ornithology,
[SPEAKER_02]: including banding, completing,
as well as different molecular techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited to apply some of
those techniques to my PhD, as well as to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue doing some modeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like you're pretty well
prepared.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to talk a little bit more about
some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: What varied?
[SPEAKER_03]: What varied between those three examples?
[SPEAKER_03]: Preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty apparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: So preparation varied.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think was good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, knowing what the context of that
research is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it matter?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organizing in a logical way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to do on your feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other things, like specifics of them?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're talking, it's not just
you're talking to anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking specifically to someone
that you want to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you really want to make sure
you're telling them why you're so excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about working with them, or why you're a
good fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other things that people noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything that you're like,
I think I might do that in an interview?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do this, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell I'm a little crazy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I walk in, and I'm like,
oh god, birds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just really excited about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are like, yeah, OK,
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality is that a lot of us end up
interviewing for grad school because we're
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you are enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you notice when Jenny talked about her
research, she still was like, migration's
[SPEAKER_04]: so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the coolest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be authentic to who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not all of us are like crazy bouncy
balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us, like, personality varies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm weird, and I'm up at
this front of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get really excitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of us are that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be any particular way
when you're interviewing.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are not judging you based on how
you perform as a person or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are looking for who you are in
reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever that is, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know yourself best, and you know how
you want to interact with other people,
[SPEAKER_04]: and how you want to build that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what you're doing,
is you're figuring out if you're a good
[SPEAKER_04]: match with these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to debrief in small groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to give you all some tools,
as we talked about, for doing your own
[SPEAKER_04]: elevator pitches, Janani has handed out
this present past future formula.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a formula.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simplistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it helps you to think about what you
might include in that introduction in the
[SPEAKER_04]: interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to give you five-ish
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you look at the sheet, you see on
the front side of it, the front side of it
[SPEAKER_04]: has a lot of questions that might relate
to your present, your past.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the back side, there's a blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a gimmicky thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to help you prep for your elevator
pitch for grad school, we're going to give
[SPEAKER_04]: you a few minutes to jot down some
experiences that fit into present,
[SPEAKER_04]: past, and future, and what narrative might
tie all of those together.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason you're doing this now is that
you're going to practice these pitches
[SPEAKER_04]: rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not stressful, probably stressful,
hopefully not too crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for your use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write something if you want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But start thinking about what your pitch
might be, and then we're going to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: do them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to pair off, and we'll do
them in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that you thought was really
helpful to hear in this debrief,
[SPEAKER_04]: or something that you're still concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so let's start this table.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of you can use the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elect someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I thought I would amplify that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The takeaway I had, one of the takeaways,
I mean, there's several, was that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: to remember that you may be really
passionate about stuff, but you're also
[SPEAKER_06]: being interviewed alongside other people
who are also very passionate about stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to think, how do I express it
in a way that makes me stand out from the
[SPEAKER_06]: pack?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can be scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: But finding that thing that you care most
about, one of the tables we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about, the thing that gets you really
going, where you're like, yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is what I feel comfortable and good
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I feel good and motivated
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you should talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're passionate about many
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to your table.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the table we talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of you want to share?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so just kind of going off of what
you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big concern of mine when I was giving my
little speech, or spiel, or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, was trying to tie in things that
you're passionate about outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of research and how that may have
drawn you into research and pushing you in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just good to know that they're
looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just what can you bring to this
job?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you bring as a human being?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of aspects to science,
or what kind of aspects to yourself can
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring to diversify our science in this
lab?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think two of the big takeaways here,
one was we were talking a little bit about
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're sort of jumping from one system
to another, like somebody who was doing
[SPEAKER_09]: more cancer research and now wants to talk
about plant metabolites, as long as you
[SPEAKER_09]: can explain why and how it's related.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like myself personally, I was an
engineering undergrad, did environmental
[SPEAKER_09]: science, now I'm in agriculture,
but it's all sustainability related.
[SPEAKER_09]: So having a narrative that makes sense to
explain why you're interested in this
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff, how you've gotten where you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's got different paths,
so that's important.
[SPEAKER_09]: One question that I told the group about
that I always ask at the end of an
[SPEAKER_09]: interview, and they thought it was all
good and wanted me to share with
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody, is I always end it by saying,
now that you've had a chance to talk to
[SPEAKER_09]: me, look at my materials and everything,
did you have any hesitation to hiring me?
[SPEAKER_09]: And how can I sort of clarify things or
explain things to you so that I can clear
[SPEAKER_09]: that up?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about a lot of different things,
but I think two main things that stood out
[SPEAKER_12]: were one was what Eugene just said,
that people come with a diversity of
[SPEAKER_12]: experiences and research backgrounds,
and how do you kind of tie all of those
[SPEAKER_12]: things into one single narrative,
and should you even do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: So how do you kind of visualize your story
that way?
[SPEAKER_12]: And the second thing we talked about was,
in terms of future plans, how specific
[SPEAKER_12]: should you get?
[SPEAKER_12]: Should you tie yourself down to one
particular career, or would the professor
[SPEAKER_12]: feel like you're not a good fit for the
lab because you're too specific?
[SPEAKER_12]: So up in the air, great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going through this, I can just kind of
see that graduate school interview is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of really different from a work interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very structured differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just trying to get a feel for a middle
of ground of how much do you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you stay focused in what you're
going to say, without going or being too
[SPEAKER_01]: broad and rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of getting to the point,
but also making sure that your point was
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for me personally, it's like
sometimes I feel like I went to sleep one
[SPEAKER_11]: day and then woke up where I am.
[SPEAKER_11]: So having to like, being able to backtrack
and figure out how I actually got here,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially because I haven't been like
invested in the sciences my whole life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually was more of like an arts and
like an English person.
[SPEAKER_11]: So trying to figure out my story and like
the reasons for why I ended up where I am
[SPEAKER_11]: and being able to explain that to somebody
else very quickly is a bit of an
[SPEAKER_11]: undertaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I definitely think I need to think
about that going forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about a couple strategies as far
as keeping calm, keeping your composure
[SPEAKER_07]: during the interview.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was having a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one was looking at sign language
to, you know, they look calm, so you
[SPEAKER_07]: should be calm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one was, you know, having some
mnemonic device or some method of figuring
[SPEAKER_07]: out what you're going to talk about,
what points you want to hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically the main point was as long
as you keep cool and don't freak out,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you do freak out, I have
freaked out in most interviews I've done,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it was like through insane
excitement or just like horrible nerves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know that you're interviewing and
they know that you're talking to somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: who did this actual interview at some
point in their path.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may or may not remember exactly what
it was like, but they did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that they want to know about
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're there because they wanted to talk
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can, for me, I always remind
myself, I'm like, I'm sitting in this seat
[SPEAKER_04]: because they told me that they wanted to
know things about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that self-talk does matter for some
more than others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is the time for you to tell
someone else what you're most excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about and you get to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know some of you talked about how do
you focus your talk?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you plan for the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have remaining questions about
that, you can find any of the grad
[SPEAKER_04]: students who are here right now and really
anyone else, anybody you want to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to do mock interviews
after lunch, but thankfully you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: break now for lunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're mock interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you around this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
