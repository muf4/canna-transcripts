[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming and for this
opportunity to talk to you about what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do in Geneva at the PGRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a bit of material in my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to touch on a lot of different
things because there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to tell you a little bit
about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about the National Plant
Germplasm System and PGRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do at PGRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also talk a little bit about the Grin
Global Database where you can order
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit about the
molecular research that we've done and
[SPEAKER_00]: also about our outreach activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NPGS, it's a cooperative effort by
the state, federal, and other
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations to preserve genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that genetic uniformity
increases crop vulnerability to pass the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NPGS provides access to genetic
diversity so that breeders, researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: can bring forth new varieties that can
tolerate or resist these diseases and
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we serve science and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We acquire, preserve, evaluate,
document, and distribute plant germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to show you, it is a
national system and is spread throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: different growing regions so that,
for example, the crops that we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, New York are things that do well
in our temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as NPGS, as of October 2017,
there were over 15,000 species conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: and over half, yeah, 583,000, half a
million accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an accession you can think of as a
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a genetically unique stock or
population or clone of a tree that is
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved as an entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as samples of seed or clones
distributed, around a quarter of a million
[SPEAKER_00]: per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the whole system, and about 30%
of those are international.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just to show you that there are
29 repositories, seed crops, clonal crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic stocks, and where some of the
larger repositories and collections are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that list on the side is from the
Green Global Database, if anybody ever
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as in Geneva, the seed crops
repository, we hold around 200 taxa and
[SPEAKER_00]: over 12,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our major seed crops are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion, celery, different brassicas,
winter squash, buckwheat, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: our largest collection, and radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, we distributed close to 8,000
samples of seed in 254 orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll talk about some of the
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we acquire germplasm, the purpose is
to fill gaps in our collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people go out on collecting trips,
those are administered by the Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange Office in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do administer domestic and
foreign plant explorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they review proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually review some of these
proposals every year and rank them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to support ex situ and in situ
conservation of crop plants and wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for PGRU, there was a
collection in 2002 of Tomatillo and the
[SPEAKER_00]: former curator, Dr. Robertson and Dr. Todd
Vision from the University of North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina did a joint collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they collected 111 accessions,
including some large fruited types that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had never had before and some
self-compatible types that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred, which is unusual for Tomatillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, Dr. Zung, who's also the research
leader at PGRU and Dr. Robertson,
[SPEAKER_00]: made a trip to the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences in Beijing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did some germplasm exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was telling Don, I was supposed to
fly to China tomorrow for a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, but because Trump is in China
this week, I can't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it'll happen at the end of the
month, next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our regeneration, it's quite a big
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a couple hundred plots usually on
average, 150 to 200 plots per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each plot is a population or accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cover them with these nylon mesh
cages when they're ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then honeybees are introduced and we
rent the honeybees hives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually do about eight different
species of cacti per year, including
[SPEAKER_00]: biennials and annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have different sized cages
depending on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter squash go into the largest
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just some pictures of the
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be isolated from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a plow to put soil over the
edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have zippers where you can
go in and out of the cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use black plastic to grow
everything except for the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's drip tape underneath the
plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the biennials, they have to be
overwintered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, all the cabbage are dug
out of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to do that now, but it rains
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure when we're going to be able
to dig them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they go into these wooden crates with
sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they're planted,
you can see they're just stubs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take off all the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got that meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That growing tissue tip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those are going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here you can see when they're in
the flowering stage, there's a cage around
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't see cabbage flowers
because you eat the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the second year what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some things, they might not
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not have enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dig them up like these collards,
the picture of the collards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fertilized for six or eight
weeks in a cold chamber in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in January, they flower in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are hand pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the crop, we have to
custom regenerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we dry the material in mesh bags
that are hanging out at the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have different types of
machines to thresh the seed, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the seed storage,
the seed will come in from the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will go into this thing called the
anti-room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pre-anti-room is where we do seed
orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controlled humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weigh the seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the anti-room, it's more like a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the anti-room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dry down the seed in that room to 6%
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's stored long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the long-term storage
facility here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically a freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do characterize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time to characterize for us is when
we're regenerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can only do highly heritable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do collaborations with breeders and
other scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get some grant funding, we can do
more traits other than just highly
[SPEAKER_00]: heritable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do things in replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in 2015, we did a field trial
of our brassica rapa accessions in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with Michael Gore and Chris
Pierce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we started a new way to collect
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought this small Android tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very lightweight, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this field book freeware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's spreadsheet compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can collect data in a way that we
can easily upload it into the Green Global
[SPEAKER_00]: Database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been talking with Steph Gayler at
the Long Island Regional Seed Consortium
[SPEAKER_00]: about they are developing a smartphone app
that they'll share with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, hopefully, it'll make it easier
for people that receive our material to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect data for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did collect data on six different
crops this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a screenshot of the field
book, given the list of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the person that put this in,
she put AL, that's the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she put that as a prefix to every
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the traits would sort together by
crop because they're alphabetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AL, in this case, is allium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then BB is biennial brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is another screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very nice interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very big interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is plot 410.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycopriscan is tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trait is leaf type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the definitions are
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dwarf, potato leaf, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she can just type in the number three
and then hit this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will scroll to the next plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also use photo as a
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will collect the photo and it will
label the photo for you with your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ID, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get images of plots of plants of
head shapes as our traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those go into the Green Global
Database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do also scanning of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, we tried to scan radish,
but it didn't scan very well because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she ended up using a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't look that nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have to remember, they were
grown for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't really grown for the radish,
the edible portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give people pictures is better than
to not give them pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's valuable to do these
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a lot of diversity
in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
Green Global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I do get quite a few
questions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did change recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, if you just Googled Green
Global and PGS, you would get,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the starting page that you would
search from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest that if you decide,
you're pretty sure you're going to order
[SPEAKER_00]: something, the first thing to do,
or maybe the second thing after you found
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want, but you want to register
with an account and then read the help
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really well written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can search for things like
descriptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the descriptors are all
crop specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how easy it is for you to
read this screen, but this is when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the descriptors link, you get the list
of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked maize and then you get the traits
for maize coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked kernel color, you put a check
mark, and then you could say equal to,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I said red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do the search and you,
I ended up with 802 maize accessions with
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel color red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would go through and check
the boxes of the ones that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on the name of it,
you'll get a more detailed page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another way to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a list of accessions,
like PI numbers usually from a paper or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, the search box expands if you
say using a list of accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just copy it from a
spreadsheet and paste it in here and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the search that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is what an accession page looks
like if you click on the accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one PI of Tomatillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, if it has it,
it will have map data in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has information here about its
source and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you click on that map for this one,
the green dot is that one accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these other dots are other
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's colored by number of accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellow is one accession, more
accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were trying to do a geographical
survey or study, this would help you to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick your material possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use multiple criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do advanced search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, there's a dropdown
list of things you can pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked here country of origin,
Brazil, the state of Rio de Janeiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for example, you could say
improvement level is breeding material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go on and on and add multiple
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I really like is the grin
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good resource for anybody
working with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives the common names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives conspecific taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives synonyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're reading an old paper and it's
a genus and species, and you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what the current name is, it's a really
good way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or common names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you try to look up the common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very scholarly set of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very well curated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a taxonomy link there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now I'm going to switch to talk a
little bit about some of the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: research that has gone on in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done quite a bit of genotyping of
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the method that we've been using is
genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably familiar with it,
because a lot of that was developed here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: $20 per DNA sample if you do a 96-well
format set of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you're finding your mutations,
your markers, your SNPs, at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're genotyping them, you don't get
the bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you just had a set of markers
and you used that set to genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: your material, you wouldn't find the
additional markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't require a reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important for us,
because with the exception of tomato and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Brassica repa had a good reference
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the other crops don't have any
reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the same slide I showed you
earlier, our major collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was I just put an asterisk
next to the ones that we've done some GBS
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done most of the major
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say we've done all the
accessions, but we've done sample
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pick the samples based on certain
criteria, such as geography or morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through these just
briefly to tell you the highlights of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I'm going to talk about
is Ion allium sepa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly consumed in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its economic value ranks third amongst the
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ancient, globally widespread crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's thousands of Ion cultivars
that have been developed to fit very
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse environments and dietary
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a costly crop to breed and conserve
because it is biennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very day length sensitive as far as
whether or not it will fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it has a very large genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very hard to develop molecular
genetic markers that breeders could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did GBS, we found 70,000 markers,
single nucleotide polymorphisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: knit markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used double haploid lines as
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those double haploid lines should be
homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever a marker is used, if the
marker was not homozygous in one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: DH lines, we threw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had a mapping population,
F2 mapping population, that our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborator, Mike Havy, had developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also used the expected segregation
ratios in that population to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: whether markers were high quality markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing this, we started with 70,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with 900 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those 900 markers should be good high
quality markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we concluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to write up a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have at the bottom here is just a
poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That GBS is promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have to analyze the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 95 of our accessions also
genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll say it is promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had to Jeff Globitz, who worked
here at Cornell, had to make custom
[SPEAKER_00]: scripts to analyze the data because it was
so challenging with this large genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to analyze it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just didn't get very good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with his custom work and expertise,
we were able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I'll talk about is Brassica
rapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different types of Asian greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be consumed raw or cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know it as mizuna, Chinese
cabbage, bok choy, spice, sarsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also vegetable turnip, which is also
used as animal fodder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also used as a cooking oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all different morpher types
that have been developed across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the genetic relationships haven't been
well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we knew more about how they were
related to each other, that would help
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and also conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to sample Brassica rapa
from our gene bank and also from the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: bank in Ames, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we genotyped 10 different morpher
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up with 333 accessions by
over 18,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was published this year earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Bird was a student in Chris Peir's
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took the lead on this and published
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he found was that there was a
genetic distinction among the morpher
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, the same morpher type might be
genetically different if it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: different geographic origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the largest data set of
this kind to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is tomatillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It originated in central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's widely cultivated in Guatemala and
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily conserved as relishes or
sauces, such as green salsa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's becoming increasingly important
in the USA as a niche crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is considered an underutilized species
by the FAO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders might be interested in size,
disease resistance, and mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous studies of population showed them
to be closely related to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was worked by Todd Vision,
who also went on that collection trip with
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we GBS genotyped 125 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a pretty large data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, to summarize, we did find a
lack of relationship based on geographical
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, similar to other researchers have
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did identify 86 pairs of accessions
that were quantitatively different from
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to graphically represent
qualitative divergence among the 125
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also confirmed the homozygousity of
some new inbred lines that Larry
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I'll talk about is wild
tomato, so this one very diverse wild
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato that's used a lot in breeding
saline and pruvianum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recently reclassified into four
distinct species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is gene flow among the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we genotyped 46 plants representing
different species, about 12 per species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used 14,000 of the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did find that based on geography,
isolation by distance is the geographical
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we found support for
isolation by distance, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were sampled and more remote
distances from each other were more
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially this pattern was observed
if it was between the pairs of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that supported some idea that there is
reproductive isolation between the
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found two of these new taxa weren't
significantly different from each other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did find a lot of markers that we
could possibly use as diagnostic markers
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a graph of what I just
mentioned that the genetic distances here
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the log of the distances
kilometers is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a species, the points are red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between species, the points are blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a higher slope in
the blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supporting that, there is more
reproductive isolation by distance between
[SPEAKER_00]: species than within a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I'll talk about quickly is
winter squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been valued for its good storage
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a thick hard skin, and it provides
a wide range of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumer demand has been increasing during
recent decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some naturally occurring
compounds that have been shown to have
[SPEAKER_00]: health benefits and also use in pest
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvement, breeding is focused on fruit
sizes and shape, non bitterness,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep orange fruit color, early news,
bush habit, insect and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have are what we call core
sets based on morphological diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 of our accessions and geographical
diversity, another 95 accessions from 38
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two sets overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a total of 165 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sample plants, multiple plants per
accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have the data collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm collaborating with people from
QCAP, including some people from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, they have some data too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put all of our data
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radish is the next one I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be that important in the US,
but across the globe, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2% of all global vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consumed as a root, as a leafy
vegetable in some places, as sprouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or seed pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also used as a cover crop or a
forage crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it as a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks up the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it provides organic material for
the soil to improve the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an ancient crop native to Eastern
Mediterranean and Eastern Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some debate whether it's had
water or multiple domestication events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot of morphological
diversity, depending on where in the globe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also adapts to local conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rich source of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a core set based on a weighted
geographical sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we sample more accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had more representation from that
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up with 35 countries,
152 accessions, and five plants per
[SPEAKER_00]: accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that data I haven't analyzed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the overlap interests with
the people in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They study radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, our relations and
collaborations with them will move this
[SPEAKER_00]: project forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one is cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's our most important crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our most important crop that we
conserve because we have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions and we get the most requests
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly consumed in fresh and
processed forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered a high value, but high
risk crop because it is very vulnerable to
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly you probably know that because
you've tried to grow some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly wild relatives are used as breeding
because it has a narrow genetic base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I said, it's very
susceptible to pests and stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers in the US want more flavor
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the heirloom types, but those
require still the resistances and shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: life and the durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have is 185 accession core set
based on geographical origins,
[SPEAKER_00]: centers by diversity, fruit shape,
heirlooms, commercially important
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assay two sets of 96 well plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I analyzed this, we ended up with
around 3,700 high quality markers in 190
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a software you can use to analyze
what you call the population structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had Pimpinalpholium as a wild
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one sample of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is showing, there's like
three virtual groups populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the yellow, the blue, and the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what these numbers are across this
axis are the 190 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these little lines is that
genotype of that one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pimpinalpholium had the most yellow
genome, you would call it, virtual genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also some of the blue,
but it didn't have any of the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this far end, genetically,
we had Pimpinalpholium.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this far end, way up here, this sample
here was a pear-type, ellipsoid-type
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato from Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a lot of the orange,
a little blue, and a little yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking for is what I point
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some kind of genotypes that kind
of stick out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a neighbor-joining tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just looking at it in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pimpinalpholium is out here,
you would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most distantly related to
all these other genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branch of length of the tree is the
genetic distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you're seeing are a lot of
things that kind of just are closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you see these outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Italian types look divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this cherry-tomato type here
that's divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get these other accessions
that are also divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of falling more towards
Pimpinalpholium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what those are, are probably Landry's
races that might have crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pimpinalpholium in their history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here, this is a Landry's
accession that's closely related to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, yet it has this big large red
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what we found is there could be
some accessions in our collection that
[SPEAKER_00]: could have diverse genes, but they still
have the large red round fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which Pimpinalpholium has a small fruit
that tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a breeder wanted to try to get
something that was divergent, but not go
[SPEAKER_00]: for that little tiny terrible fruit,
they might try to use something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're winding down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I just want to mention was
some of our outreach and education
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rarely ever say no if somebody asks us
to do outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to accommodate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our most popular things that we
get invited for is to extract DNA from a
[SPEAKER_00]: banana using common household chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show over here what we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an elementary school in
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Science Night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the kids come and they get
to do it hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get to see the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a toothpick and they can pull the
DNA out of the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the DNA home if they want to,
a lot of them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give them the protocol so they can
take it home and teach other people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just try to educate the public
about what DNA is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I'm pretty heavily
involved in is called the Northern Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable Improvement Collaborative,
NOVIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people at Cornell are also involved in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Michael Missouri right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Molly John was the one that kind of
started it many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't under the same name,
but it's the same project that's evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to breed new varieties for
organic conditions that do well in
[SPEAKER_00]: northern climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they try to identify the best varieties
for organic farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work directly with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate others on organic seeds,
variety trials, and on-farm breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do mostly because we're so
good at seed cleaning, we teach people
[SPEAKER_00]: about saving seed and how to process seed,
how to grow things to save the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are pictures from a fair that we
do in Maine every year where we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up a trailer full of like threshers
and the wet seed processor for the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a lot of people coming to try
and learn how to do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hand out a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hand out seeds also that brings
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna wrap it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thank you all for your patience and
for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big staff that I work with every
day and they make all this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ranges from greenhouse to farms to the
seed storage to the database person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Susan does research support,
like the field characterization and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of technical assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three individuals just graduated
from Hobart and William Smith Colleges
[SPEAKER_00]: last spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came on to work with us
temporarily and learn a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a picture of me and Larry
Robertson, our former curator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Meg McGrath in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato trials a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have such sandy soil down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use a golf cart and that was
really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be happy to take any questions and
thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joanne, do you want to see if Geneva has
any questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, are you there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanne, that was a lovely talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious with your allium diversity
study, it looked like you really had to
[SPEAKER_01]: whittle down the good SNPs to what,
700 or 900?
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your really wacky segregation distortion
that you saw in that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any idea what the- Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of it has to do with probably
tandem duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I wasn't able to analyze
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did get a set of SNPs that I would
give them to our collaborator Mike Havy to
[SPEAKER_00]: map them, he found that they were
clustering together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't really well distributed
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, Jeff had to really do a
lot of extra custom scripts to analyze the
[SPEAKER_00]: data to get down to those 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Zach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got one.
Okay.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with the increased access to
sequencing information, we're seeing kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a push to develop core sets for our
collections that breeders might use in
[SPEAKER_02]: future breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious like what you think from a
conservation standpoint, the implications
[SPEAKER_02]: of developing such core sets, whether
positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's different ideas about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get rid of things and
say, we have this core set that represents
[SPEAKER_00]: all the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the rest of the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that I would be in
favor or NPGS doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have what you call core set.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I don't even like to call
the core set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it a diversity panel based
on whatever it was developed, geography or
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I imagine there is a lot of
redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's probably a lot of
redundancy and we can't conserve all of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just cost too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for something like tomato,
the life of those seeds is 50 or 100 years
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we store them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can afford to keep them until
somebody can sequence the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it'll be that long before
it'll be affordable to sequence the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: genome on multiple plants per accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what makes a high quality
SNP versus a low quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you decide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to analysis pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that you look at, how many times
was it observed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have millions of sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many times was it observed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be a threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set these parameters depending on your
sample size and the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for the mapping population,
they need to be in the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want anything that wasn't in the
parents in that mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to segregate the way they
were expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to be homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing is we don't want more
than two alleles at locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mutations in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not likely going to get three
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an alignment problem with
the sequence that gave you that third or
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have GATC, you just want two of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want three or four of those
because that's probably alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: misalignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was an insertion or deletion
nearby that caused it to look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that you
set the parameters in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it filtering them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Joanne, you spoke about putting seeds
into the deep freeze for long-term
storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you periodically retest the viability
of that seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they go into storage, they're
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things that just came out of the
field in 2017, after they're given a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to dry down, then they'll be
viability tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have good viability,
we won't probably keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's the only thing we have,
then we would keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they should undergo depending on
the crop, every five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of thing, if we could
get more feedback from people that we send
[SPEAKER_00]: it to, we wouldn't necessarily have to do
that germ test ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we send somebody 50 seeds and they
say, oh, they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 100% germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would use that observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we do some of our own germ
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also outsource some of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The PGRU vegetable seed collection,
are there species that are self-
[SPEAKER_03]: incompatible?
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, how do you deal with that
as far as detaining them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-incompatible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use the honeybees in the
cages, or we do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the accession is a diverse population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have, within that accession,
it's not incompatible with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do out-cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have to do it by hand with a
paintbrush, we do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to cross other plants in
the same accession, like radish,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of highly-inbred
material, or highly-inbred stocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: or mutant stocks, or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't generally have that kind of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have populations.
OK.
I want to again thank Joanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
