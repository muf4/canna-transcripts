[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome to the Cornell turfgrass video
log.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here at the Bethpage State Park in
early June and one of the things we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to notice on the greens,
and I think we're noticing this all over
[SPEAKER_00]: northern climates, is we've come through
some heat and then some cool weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spring growth surge is just about
behind us now and it's about time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: two grass systems we manage on putting
greens start to react a little
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we've got a much more
starting to get an increase in bent grass
[SPEAKER_00]: as the heat is coming on and it's starting
to get a little bit leggy, so that may
[SPEAKER_00]: need some additional cultural practices,
top dressing, vertical mowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've got to be really careful
because if you start to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively, the annual bluegrass,
which will not like the heat, will not
[SPEAKER_00]: take it as well and you could set yourself
up for additional problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially as we're approaching the summer
equinox and we get to that climatological
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum ET where sun's highest in the sky,
and we're losing about two-tenths of an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch of water a day, we'll have to really
keep track of our stressful practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the bent grass might need it,
the annual bluegrass might suffer from
[SPEAKER_00]: some damage if you try to be too
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find that sweet spot in getting
that bent grass managed to provide a good
[SPEAKER_00]: putting surface without adding additional
problems to the annual bluegrass.

Thank you.
