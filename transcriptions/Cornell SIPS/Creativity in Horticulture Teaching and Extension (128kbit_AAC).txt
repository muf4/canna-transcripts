[SPEAKER_09]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first reaction when I was getting ready
was, what a dorky title for a
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you where it came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a week in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother-in-law was failing in health,
and we needed to move her into an assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: living facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got an email from Neil saying,
I need a seminar title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounded like a good idea at the
time, not having any idea where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at this point, I have a little
bit of a better sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm Marcia Eam Sheaveley,
and I have this unusual split in our
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually 50% teaching as a senior
lecturer and 50% extension as a senior
[SPEAKER_00]: extension associate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that as a non-tenure track
factor, faculty member, I see this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: dreamy split because it's all education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be viewed as tough to get tenure
on, but I'm really grateful for it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it does afford me the opportunity to
really wallow in education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a presentation like this,
when I look back over the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always a little tricky to know
whether to go for breadth or depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I be giving you a sort of dog and
pony show, so to speak, of everything I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done for the last five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were in your shoes, I don't think I'd
find it that interesting or go for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually going to try to shoot for
both today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is in four slides,
I'm going to do sort of highlights of the
[SPEAKER_00]: last five years, four dense, text heavy
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't linger on them so that I can
then go more deeply into something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: find interesting and hope you will as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me while I do a quick
overview because I do think it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have a sense of, how have I spent
my time in the last five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to do some highlights
and then walk away from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of these intrigue you, you can make
a note of it and just ask me about it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, teaching highlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do teach a university course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture 2010 was accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a university course, which is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the university supports it,
champions it, sees it as a model of
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary excellence, and promotes
it throughout the university, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a really wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also teach a global service learning
course cross-listed with IARD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I co-teach with Marvin Pritz, a
collaboration leadership and career skills
[SPEAKER_00]: course for all of our incoming freshmen in
the plant sciences, and most recently
[SPEAKER_00]: started a new intensive study and
botanical illustration course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the advisor for Hortus Forum and
tried to strengthen their academic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a Hortus Forum officer
leadership development class, and I offer
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of special topics courses and
work with a lot of individual study
[SPEAKER_00]: students and have a couple of formal
internships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also went through the process,
and this is a really great project for any
[SPEAKER_00]: of you who are in teaching and you want to
go a little bit further into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Teaching Excellence offers the
opportunity to become a teaching scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work closely with them, take
workshops, you do a project, they observe
[SPEAKER_00]: your teaching, and I recently completed
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also started a horticulture minor
with a focus on the botanical arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of my assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought a number of them over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some rubrics and other approaches
to assessing things like project work,
[SPEAKER_00]: writing, participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of effort into it and actually
now work with people throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: university, often referred by folks in the
Center for Engaged Learning and Research,
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with them to develop similar
rubrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their courses, actually including Don,
we recently had a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the inaugural engaged
learning and research faculty fellows and
[SPEAKER_00]: was awarded a Kaplan Family Distinguished
Faculty Fellowship in 2009, and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: received two teaching awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of extension highlights,
we've spent quite a bit of time trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more culturally responsive and hired a
student who worked with me to interview a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of extension educators that
culminated in a Spanish language
[SPEAKER_00]: translation of one of our online
curricula.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a really exciting take root
CCE educator enrichment approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hired Liz Falk.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a bulk of the workshops now
around the state, really primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on the professional development
of our educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Received a grant to start a statewide
partnership with the New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: Library system and also collaborated with
UC Davis to create a searchable database
[SPEAKER_00]: of garden-based learning research,
and we've initiated some model gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: small as beautiful, some small model
gardens around New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created numerous online curricula,
including a big food systems curriculum,
[SPEAKER_00]: youth grow youth leadership curriculum,
and cultivating creativity in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum all online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hosted the first youth grow summit,
which was a youth leadership summit for
[SPEAKER_00]: young people interested in being food
systems champions, and I teach a suite of
[SPEAKER_00]: distance learning courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two times a year, I teach a suite of three
botanical illustration courses and an
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction to garden design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know that's just a lot,
but I feel it's necessary to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into that in any
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested, please ask me about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now a little bit more of the depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the context, whether I'm involved
in teaching or extension, these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are the most important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a wonderful opportunity,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four years ago, I had my first
really awful semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really awful semester,
and it gave me the chance to try to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about why is it so bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I not getting through in this
class?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that I haven't articulated
that's important to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a whole semester thinking,
what have I not conveyed that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me, and how could I do a
better job of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the semester,
here's what I had come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep learning, genuine participation and
engagement, reflection, community,
[SPEAKER_00]: civility, and respect, and creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find them all in my rubrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clear to my students that these
are important to me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure it, I look for it, remind people
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stand behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an awful semester, and it was
really a wonderful semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about any of those
above five for the remainder of the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk about creativity,
because I spend so much of my life
[SPEAKER_00]: wallowing in it that I think it's
important that you all, as my colleagues,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand why that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we have somebody in our department
who is explicitly looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to begin with some
definitions for your benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it to be creative?
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the dictionary, it is
relating to or involving the imagination
[SPEAKER_00]: or original ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it is to be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And creativity is the ability to transcend
traditional ideas, rules, patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships, and the like, to create
meaningful new ideas, forms, methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's originality, progressiveness,
or imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what creative and creativity
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcending traditional ideas,
original ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go any further, and I love
this painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really appreciate it in this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this in January, and on my screen
it's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to just sort of spend some time
looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have brought in the original,
but I would have gotten off track with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to have an awkward pause,
and I'm going to pause for just a moment
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask you this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your work as a researcher,
a teacher, an extension specialist,
[SPEAKER_00]: a student.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you creative within the context of
your work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it mean to you to be
creative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly every one of us in this room is
not the purview of artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not creative, we're probably not
here at Cornell University, because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: about original ideas, new thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just pause for a moment and think about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may even want to write a note to self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about any facet of your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're thinking about that,
you might want to think about what if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything blocks that ability to think or
act creatively?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just kind of hold that thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come back to these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an opportunity to tell me a
little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just hold that thought for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the rest of this presentation
is structured, first I want to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the what of what I work on in this arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spending a lot of time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to come back to that
question of maybe why it matters to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll share with you why it matters to
me and to my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past five years, I've put a lot
of energy into kind of the arts-based part
[SPEAKER_00]: of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big online curriculum called Dig
Art, Cultivating Creativity in the Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an avenue to ecological stewardship
through the creative arts in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I mentioned the Art of Horticulture
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spending a lot of time guiding
students in the creative process in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture, producing all sorts of novel
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our dean sitting with our
students out in front of the, when we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the sod sofa in front of Caldwell Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot in this area, a lot of
activity and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this new horticulture minor with a
focus on the botanical arts, and students
[SPEAKER_00]: are already enrolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seven students signed up and I just
launched it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pleased with that as a good start
because some of them, I had a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: seniors who wanted to do it, but they
just, you know, they couldn't meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for the minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this distance, these distance
courses that I teach to students all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, I'm telling you if there's one
thing I can do that I can stand behind and
[SPEAKER_00]: say that I do well, man, I can tell you
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can teach people to draw and paint and
work online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very confident about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most times that I teach it, I have
students that surpass me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is John Perry's drawing and graphite
of a mountain laurel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took him 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at that and say, I could not,
I don't think I could do that at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So students work their way through a
series of courses that take them ever
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper into proficiency and technical
skill as well as the ability to portray
[SPEAKER_00]: plants beautifully and creatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm astonished at what they're able to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not kidding you, I just wrapped up
a unit this weekend of three courses and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of students who are now a lot
better than I am, which is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is the work that just sort
of bridges teaching and extension and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a good example is Patrick Doherty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought him here as a messenger
lecturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collaborated with Larry Smart,
which was so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought all this willow at the
Children's Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 100 people working with this
world-renowned sculptor to produce this
[SPEAKER_00]: just amazing piece of sculpture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like nearly chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Patrick Doherty right at the center
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scouts are running all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm putting a lot of energy into this
arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking a good chunk of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to ask the
question, why does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why does this matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we be having in this department
someone who's putting energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: arts-based coursework and effort and
reflect on that and be transparent about
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my thoughts about it, but I'd love
to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we even begin with the second
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you answer that earlier question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it to be creative?
[SPEAKER_00]: What blocks your creativity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do you think this work matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to spend about 20
minutes telling you why I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hear from some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my students know, if I pause,
I'm really waiting for somebody else to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was that word opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means taking an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're talking about somewhat
traditional arts approaches in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: creative performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it to be creative in your
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear somebody address that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_09]: To be able to think outside the box and
answer these questions that are the gaps
[SPEAKER_09]: in the research.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so sometimes that involves completely
novel thinking and designing an approach
[SPEAKER_09]: that's never been done.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then you also have the, it blocks your
creativity because you have to follow
[SPEAKER_09]: what's been done before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has to be publishable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you can be creative, but within
those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, you've got some
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about those of you at Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you have to say about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for me, the bottom of being
creative is to sort of challenge what
[SPEAKER_06]: people believe, whether it's a grower or
whether it's a fellow or a co-culturalist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the way we do things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, ask the question, why do you do it
that way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it been tried another way?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then develop some sort of a study or a
test for that hypothesis that we all
[SPEAKER_06]: believe in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But nobody really knows why or when it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead, Neil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stephanie said, sometimes we can't really
be so creative because we're trying to set
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves to accomplish a specific
objective.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's ways that we can still be
creative in our research, like we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about in the past, an undergraduate
student will come to me and be interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: In an independent research project,
I don't have any sort of time and money
[SPEAKER_04]: invested in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can think of something really
creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it fails, that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we still learn something in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more often than not, it works out and
turns into something bigger than that in
[SPEAKER_04]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That point about failure, I think that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an element of risk-taking and
adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, then we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're missing out on an opportunity
individually as well as institutionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right there with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of why this work matters,
I would like to tell you why I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of courses and approaches
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it is because it helps
open up students to exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get that practice in a
traditional classroom setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these courses, what my hope is in the
next 20 minutes or so, that I can convince
[SPEAKER_00]: you, so to speak, that this is more than
drawing a pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than something that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although for me, if it's beautiful alone,
that's terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think here is I'll be real
transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are entering a new era of a plant
science school, for example, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: even more important that people understand
that this kind of suite of approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nested firmly in our discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an add-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I'd like to spend the rest
of our time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'd like to offer a definition of
horticulture and just remind us that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: the art and science of cultivating gardens
or plants, depending on the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very part of our discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right at the heart of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in our definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say a few words about
botanical illustration, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for people, the botanical arts or
an arts focus equals botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth mentioning that it has a foot
that's firmly rooted in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it combines this kind of analytical
thinking with a conceptual approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its main purpose is to illustrate and
convey accurate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a scientific exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're depicting what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't like to do this kind of
painting, but I kind of did one to show my
[SPEAKER_00]: students that I can, since I'm teaching
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to do work that's a little more
painterly and less accurate, but have that
[SPEAKER_00]: there to show you that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can show us information about life
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them all depicted in this one
illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can tell us about plants and context,
their habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can do that beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see drawing versus photography,
some people might wonder about
[SPEAKER_00]: illustration in an era of photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that illustration to the right,
how it's drawing out details that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see a little bit more closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need beauty in our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is something worth
celebrating and not pushing off to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Benta King, the late Benta King's
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a botanical illustrator in the
Bailey Hortorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually use her textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love the book, Beautiful
Botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a wonderful book, and it's
perfect for my coursework.
[SPEAKER_00]: But frankly, what really gets me excited
is the more creative, the more thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the box, thinking beyond a
botanical illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turf work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, more than acre-sized piece of
artwork that I produced with eight
[SPEAKER_00]: students out at Bluegrass Lane,
designed to be viewed from the air as
[SPEAKER_00]: people were coming into the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was nothing short of thrilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got up, and we had flight time with the
Eastdale Flying Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one student made a movie of it that's
now on the Reb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watch it every once in a while,
because I find it so thrilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, collaborating with some
unlikely colleagues when it comes to this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Miller, who put this whimsical,
amazing bulb labyrinth out at Bluegrass
[SPEAKER_00]: Lane, was hoping he'd be here so I could
tease him about it a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ken Mudge, who really got into
teaching students about tree sculpture as
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to learn about plant propagation,
or Frank Rossi, who has become like the
[SPEAKER_00]: sod sofa artist guy, who just really loves
that as a way of teaching people about
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to, the rest of the theme
is about why this matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Cornell University, I just got an
email in the last three weeks from the
[SPEAKER_00]: provost and the dean of the College of
Architecture, Art and Planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to a few of us around the
university, and it said, while there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great deal of impressive art-related
activity in various creative corners of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, this activity has not coalesced
into a broad public sense of the arts at
[SPEAKER_00]: this university.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in contrast to some of our peers,
which have discovered and promoted the
[SPEAKER_00]: arts as an important component of their
intellectual mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, the goal is to find a
collective and inclusive structure that
[SPEAKER_00]: can serve to advance and highlight the
arts as a key academic dimension of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell and serve more effectively as a
port of call for development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening right now, and we're
leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a part of who we are, and we're
actually leading the charge here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: university, which I'm absolutely thrilled
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at that Dig Art curriculum and
we look at what's happening with our
[SPEAKER_00]: extension audiences, what we're learning
is that arts-based approaches to
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, to the sciences, speaks to a
diversity of learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes learning meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can foster critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It develops reflective learners,
helps learners to engage with important
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas and questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates an interdisciplinary and
holistic curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps students to question concepts and
make connections, makes learning visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for program evaluation
assessments for young children,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're trying to get at what they
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can ask them to draw a garden
before and after a program, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable how they change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the arts as a way of
understanding what people are learning at
[SPEAKER_00]: younger ages, which is really thrilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the rest of the presentation,
what I'll be doing is sharing with you
[SPEAKER_00]: some quotes that I've pulled out from
reflective writing, what students say
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they get out of this
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Melissa knows, as Alex knows,
I don't see Brian Emmett here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have thousands of pages of student
reflections about what they learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you I'm not going to read that
much to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard to crystallize it into
short quotes for this presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what I'll be sharing with you
for the remainder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things that we hear,
and it's one of my favorite parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching arts-based approaches,
is that students get new eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is fundamentally not about
learning to draw or paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's first about learning to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You first have to know what you're looking
at before you can know what to do with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it blows people's minds when they
start to see what is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff that students have been
tuning out their whole lives suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: comes rushing in, and it is nothing short
of amazing, miraculous wonderment,
[SPEAKER_00]: really and truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One student said, perhaps the ultimate
highlight of this course is that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: developed my sense of observation to a new
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand still without being aware of
incredible sights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just see objects as complete and
whole entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see textures, light, line, shapes,
tones, shadings, motion that are beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: just as isolated parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as I take in the appreciation of
independence, I see the whole again as a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis of these parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost overwhelming to be so aware,
and I feel in tune with nature in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another student emailed me just this
morning and said, creativity comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: deep observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of this poem, and I love
this poem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this from Tom Whitlow,
and I read it often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Three Goals by David
Budbill, and he says, The first goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the thing itself in and for itself,
to see it simply and clearly for what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No symbolism, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second goal is to see each individual
thing as unified, as one, with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other 10,000 things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this regard, a little wine helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third goal is to grasp the first and
the second goals, to see the universal and
[SPEAKER_00]: the particular simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding this one, call me when you get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students in the distance courses
and here on campus get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they can see the parts and the
whole all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that feeling when I'm painting,
and again, it's just amazing, the feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: that it gives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sense of curiosity, whether a student is
deepening their approach to a painting or
[SPEAKER_00]: working with plants and learning tree
sculpture, I hear again and again that
[SPEAKER_00]: reconnecting with a sense of what it is to
be curious again is something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture 2010 has put me back in touch
with the feelings that originally caused
[SPEAKER_00]: my interest in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow over the past few years,
through my academics and work in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture, I've gotten away from those
feelings of wonder and curiosity that stem
[SPEAKER_00]: from the creation both within horticulture
and art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that the class changed my
perspective, rather reintroduced me to one
[SPEAKER_00]: that played such an important role in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that comes up again
and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the TAs in these classes know,
we have thousands of pages about how
[SPEAKER_00]: stepping aside, using a different part of
your brain, getting outside, doing
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing, helps students and
others to learn to manage stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at a workshop we did with adults
at Longwood Gardens through the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Hort Society, and I had so many pages,
but I'll just share this quote with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only time in my week that I'm not
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of sad, but we hear that
quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest change I would say I've seen
in students and adults and adult learners
[SPEAKER_00]: through the distance courses in the last
decade is they're terrified of making a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their fear of failure is just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people come in, and again,
I think you can have a sense in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these courses, it's easy, what can it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students don't know the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come in, they know how to study
for an exam, but they are so unsure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: creative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take big risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gandhi and Grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Mann Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: We projected an image on a canvas of grass
that we had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a big black velvet box,
and we burned that image into the grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it was revealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd never done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big risk, and it's on display in
Mann Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the students did this huge thing from
the air, the whole time we're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if it's a bomb?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we get up there and it doesn't
look like anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real thrill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a student who made the first grass
dress, and she failed at it, but we all
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one student says, because this studio
has opened the door to creativity and more
[SPEAKER_00]: courageous actions, I have become less
hesitant in speaking up in other classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bit of a surprise there, but again,
it's something I hear a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got an improved mood from doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not say that our work is fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating sod sofas and exploring,
working with our discipline in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are in the lower left-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that big rooted installation
that'll be going in down on Lime Slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a joyful project that celebrates
human well-being, and it's in our
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be launching that in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realizing how important it is to take time
for what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, making something with my
hands has greatly improved my happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's a person in the room
that can't relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A change in attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can play out in a number of different
ways, but this is one short quote that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning comes from trying new things and
not being perfect, which is novel for a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, not being perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really something right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel as if I'm getting into some tricky
terrain, but I'll back my way out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to show you this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a color pencil from someone from
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, way better than anything I think I
could come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just absolutely a stunning piece of
work that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught a class in recent years and went
around the room and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you here for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you hope to get out of this
semester?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first student who responded indicated
that they were recovering from cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on campus, here, and they were
here for healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second student said, well,
now that you've admitted that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that I took a mental
health leave, and I'm back on campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm taking this class because of its
reputation for healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continued like that around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, I'm thinking, oh, man,
I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be thinking, well,
wait a minute now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that our responsibility here in
horticulture to offer a class that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally about healing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, aren't you going a bit out on a
limb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may not be explicitly,
but we are all responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being of our students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can do all of this other and
have that be a reason that students take
[SPEAKER_00]: our class, that is one big, fat bonus,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual application of horticultural
skills and knowledge, expanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: understandings of horticulture and what we
can do in our discipline is another theme
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are learning plant propagation,
but we're making tree sculpture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the work inside and with fibers
and dyes, you know, it's just one more way
[SPEAKER_00]: that students get to know our discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often laugh about the student who said,
I'm a real expert on dyeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told me this in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you should be helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know the reason I'm telling you
is I wrote a 60-page paper on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never actually done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, big expansion for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from an ag ed major, but I really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an agriculture education major,
I can definitely foresee doing this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of activity in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were referring to building a sod
sofa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think high school students would really
appreciate breaking away from textbooks
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting to use their creativity in the
construction of a project like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turf grass couch not only emphasizes
art, but it can also fit into a curriculum
[SPEAKER_00]: around plant science, horticulture,
business management, insect pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management, and numerous other subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since ag ed is about real life problem
solving and application, I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of activity would benefit
numerous students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm loving how they're taking what
they're learning and stretching it in all
[SPEAKER_00]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting with something larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a category of, you know,
the students who really kind of go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit further out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle Hodgins, many of you I think
maybe didn't cross paths with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She jumped ship from animal science,
came into the plant sciences, and produced
[SPEAKER_00]: a sod cow, these cow's letters when she
graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the one who did the mural in the
hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it was her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she ended up going on to design
school and just she launched here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really connected with something
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple very brief quotes that
I really liked that I've gotten this
[SPEAKER_00]: semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I feel I see the potential in the
form and everything now in puddles and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and fallen branches and rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another student says, regarding light,
most of the plants or for that matter our
[SPEAKER_00]: river are coated with ice or frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shimmery light reflected is
magnificent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you capture it on paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just enjoy the moment for what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greater confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of goes back to that risk
taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times at Cornell we are challenged
and it feels like we don't measure up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through the exercises we do in studio,
I always leave with a new found sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can create these different forms of
horticultural art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a confidence boost that I wish more
students could experience because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: really help students stay sane in this
stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this, it's not just a pretty
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to actually offer for you,
I had thought about doing this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it might be a bit of a leap for
our seminar, but I do want to offer the
[SPEAKER_00]: types of things that we actually do in
these classes to get us to change our
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some sample exercises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a negative space where they're
drawing the spaces around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lighting exercise where they're
moving lights all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's one I have up here if anyone
wants to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 25 copies if you want to take them
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take a drawing, and this was
Melissa's, like oh my gosh, aha moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They draw it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take it like this and they draw it
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do, they're amazed at how
accurate they've gotten because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not labeling it as tulips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just drawing lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all these little tricks that we
can do to make this sort of left or right
[SPEAKER_00]: brain leap, which is really kind of
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to conclude by, well here's
another one of these surpasses me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got this one this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnolia leaves and graphite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing that somebody can do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, I don't know what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an extraordinary piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to close with an excerpt from a
poem, and I think it captures our work
[SPEAKER_00]: here in this department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called When Death Comes by Mary
Oliver, and I'm just going to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's over, I want to say,
all my life I was a bride married to
[SPEAKER_00]: amazement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the bridegroom taking the world into
my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it is over, I don't want to wonder if
I've made of my life something particular
[SPEAKER_00]: and real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to find myself sighing and
frightened or full of argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to end up simply having
visited this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that's the cool thing about
our discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not just about being observers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just visiting this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about pruning and feeling and
touching and tasting and drinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also about capturing in a
beautiful way all of that activity in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate your participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say a few thank yous.
[SPEAKER_00]: First to Craig Kramer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of these beautiful images were
shot by him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always there in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he makes us all look good by capturing
our work in a particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Lori Brewer and Liz Falk,
my closest colleagues in Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden-based learning, the teaching
assistants in my courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you, I'm really well aware that
I would not be able to give this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar in every department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate that you have
allowed for the growth of this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: work here in the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much of what we like to do and what
expands our minds and makes us relax is
[SPEAKER_07]: actually working with clients,
physically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you've done is taken an extra
step where you're interacting more
[SPEAKER_07]: actively with an artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: But already that first step is really very
valuable, it seems to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to make sure that as we become
more and more academic that we don't lose
[SPEAKER_07]: touch of the tactics or the art of
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like this gets people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one more way to get them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're touching, they're feeling,
they're tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one assignment I have,
and it's my favorite assignment in the art
[SPEAKER_00]: of horticulture class, that asks students
to walk across campus looking up one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up when you're walking across campus
and then write about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's both profound and horrifying
because students will say, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they start noticing the
beauty of our landscape and wondering why
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't looked up, they start looking
at each other's faces and really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's really a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, again, it's one more entree into
noticing this incredible world of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: around us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, as somebody who was first
associated with the old department of
[SPEAKER_08]: horticulture and ornamental horticulture
40 years ago this year, I viewed that
[SPEAKER_08]: department at that time as very
traditional.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find it very encouraging,
particularly as we move into this unknown
[SPEAKER_08]: horizon of the plant science school that
there is a Marsha Eam Sheetley associated
[SPEAKER_08]: with this department because I think that
this need, and I do feel it is a need,
[SPEAKER_08]: to think creatively, to think differently
is going to be essential as we define the
[SPEAKER_08]: roles of our unit within the larger
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to communicate it and
not let it get buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is easy to miss and understand,
you know, what this type of work is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's just pretty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody at Geneva have a comment or a
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Marsha, I have a question about what
you think about photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looked like you teach primarily
drawing and painting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even got the impression that you
were comparing drawing and painting to
[SPEAKER_03]: photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And almost saying photography was not a
creative art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering what you think about
the creativity involved in photography and
[SPEAKER_03]: computer graphics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you incorporate that into your
teaching as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to give that impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with that one particular slide,
it showed how you can do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: one medium but not the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two people in here have come in to
teach in my class, Chris Wayne and Craig
[SPEAKER_00]: Kramer, to talk about the sort of basics
of photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig takes them through some digital
manipulations that some students have just
[SPEAKER_00]: taken right off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a real foundation in the
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of students in art and
horticulture, a number of students in that
[SPEAKER_00]: course do a lot with photography as a
creative project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that I would not have
wanted to leave you with that impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing my own, I'm using visuals
for my own skill set, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing off paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all that's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Marsha, I was wondering if you could
comment on some of the differences between
[SPEAKER_08]: the online course techniques you use and
the in-person sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Online grew out of the campus work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it was when people get
together in a room and do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: creative, there's invariably this
self-denigration that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks they're the worst one in
the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's looking at what other people
are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happens in middle
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happens that makes people feel
really insecure about whatever it is
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes up again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2005, I thought, I wonder if online
would actually be one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: environments in which it's better because
nobody can see your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it is in some ways,
especially with adults who don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only one that has to see their
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can post it if they wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way in which it's different is just
you imagine that you're being taught to
[SPEAKER_00]: draw or paint or work in charcoal or
whatever it is online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really be sequential and
stepwise because I'm not there to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annalisa has actually taken some of the
coursework.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to share the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just super sequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do some readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the courses, you watch some
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do, do, do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You upload your assignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also submit a piece of reflective
writing every weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way it's different is just
it has to be really sequential for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can comment on taking an online one,
although I haven't taken it live,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I can't compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that came to my mind was how
we have to spend so much of our time here
[SPEAKER_02]: at Cornell in the stuff that we are good
at or supposed to be good at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the things that we have spent time
preparing for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, not knowing anything about art
and going into this, just the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading the book that Marcia referred to,
it was like, oh, hoo-hoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was reminded of Emma Chodron's quote
about the expert mind has very few
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities, but the beginner's mind has
lots of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's part of what it did for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments or questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make tons of copies because I
didn't know if everyone would want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a participation rubric that I
just love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It defines what participation is in my
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some reflective writing
guidelines and rubrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a final project guidelines and
rubrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's that upside down drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does give you a little window into
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I know that I've taken one part
of my work and gone into it deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you ever have any other questions
about that first jam-packed set of slides
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're curious about or you see
opportunities for collaboration or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, then don't hesitate to speak
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being an intent advisor.
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
