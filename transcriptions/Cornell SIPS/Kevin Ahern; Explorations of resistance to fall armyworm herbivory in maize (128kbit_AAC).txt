[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a privilege and an honor to
be here in front of you all today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As some of you know, I've been at the
Boyce Thompson Institute for 17 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally started out taking out the
trash and washing glassware.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've sort of clawed my way up to the
top, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year, I got, or early,
yeah, it was last year, I started getting
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, well, I should say since I
joined George Jander's lab, he works on,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a chemical ecologist, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's worked on insects, plant insect
interactions for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just got in a maze about the time that
I started in his lab about four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was sort of looking for a
project, I started thinking about fall
[SPEAKER_02]: armyworm and what a big problem it's sort
of become.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a little bit about fall armyworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a generalist lepidopteran herbivore
that feeds on over 100 plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it prefers grasses, in fact,
most crop plants that are grasses,
[SPEAKER_02]: most grains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding occurs primarily in the world at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And crop losses can literally approach
100%, if not controlled, using modified BT
[SPEAKER_02]: germplasm or using synthetic insecticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most we know about the genetic control
about it is that it's a complex trait
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled by at least seven QTL that
explains 48% of the phenotypic variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I really got into thinking about
this was when fall armyworm was discovered
[SPEAKER_02]: in Africa in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of just this past September,
this report here, if any of you are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in this at all, this just came
out in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good and comprehensive and
really scary as to how bad the situation
[SPEAKER_02]: is in Africa right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they've surveyed 54 countries and it's
been found in 28 of these countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a huge problem because the
primary management strategy is to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the chemicals can be obtained,
especially by small holdup farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we know that there's a genetic
variance and thanks to Nick for these
[SPEAKER_02]: photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this is really, I should say,
this is really a project that Nick and I
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing together.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for him and Ed's group for
providing me the seed and Margaret for
[SPEAKER_02]: moving the germplasm forward, I wouldn't
be doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the left, you can see this is B73.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the, whoops, this is the reference
genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's susceptible to fall armyworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the right, this is MP73.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 706.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a line that was improved in
Mississippi by Paul Williams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's derived from more tropical
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the problem in Africa,
Nick and I both asked these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the genetic factors that
contribute to anti-biosis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing chemicals to harm the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anti-xenosis, maybe the pest will just go
someplace else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or tolerance where the plant can actually
handle getting attacked and produce grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what are the biochemical pathways
and compounds conferring armyworm
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance in maize?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know a little bit about resistance in
other caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our lab, we use primarily beet
armyworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is it the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it different?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty closely related,
but the mechanisms could be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how can we leverage the vast
natural diversity found in maize to
[SPEAKER_02]: address these questions in a rapid manner
because the situation is so dire in
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, and American farmers could use
this sort of information too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with, when I got talking
with Nick about this and how bad it was in
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, he's like, I have lines,
I have seed that I've improved over about
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years, and they're ready to go to test
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, great, now I have a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'm OK on these genetics,
so you guys can shout out if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these were developed by Nick and
the Buckle Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the initial goal was to develop an
early flowering, temperate adapted,
[SPEAKER_02]: fall armyworm resistant inbred lines to
use in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if climate change is real,
which I think most of us think it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: that offers an opportunity for the
armyworm to expand its range in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it can't die a pause, so it can't
survive the winters up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does just fine in South Florida and
in South Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it moves up here in the
summertime and usually gets to Western New
[SPEAKER_02]: York right around pollination time,
mid to late August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the base population was the NAMM
founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NAMM founders are 25 diverse inbreds
that were back crossed to B73 to make
[SPEAKER_02]: recombinant inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are just the founders of that
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were open pollinated in a
polycross block design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just let it fly and harvested it
and then took all the seed, put it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: bin, pooled it, and then planted it out
the next season and selected for early
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering time for the next two seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then planted it down in Puerto Rico
and selected for fall armyworm resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: under pressure there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they self-pollinated for another six
to nine generations to maximize
[SPEAKER_02]: homozygosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also decided to look at five African
accessions, two X plant variety protection
[SPEAKER_02]: accessions of opposing heterotic droves,
so stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could test for combining ability to
make resistant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our evaluation scheme was going to
be we wanted to do a whole plant no choice
[SPEAKER_02]: assay to assess catapult performance and
to survey damaged tissue for induced
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to do choice assays to
distinguish susceptible from resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the things I have in the queue is that
these inbred lines are currently being
[SPEAKER_02]: sequenced and we hope to do some GWAS on
them, genome-wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also looking at historical
data from 2015 and 2016 in Puerto Rico to
[SPEAKER_02]: do some GWAS on those perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the no choice performance test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a chamber at VTI down in the
basement and we got some perforated bread
[SPEAKER_02]: bags to hold the little critters in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put one armyworm in the world of plant
because that's their preferred feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let them go for a week and then
we'd retrieve the caterpillars a week
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd weigh them to measure performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they don't like the plant,
they won't feed on it or they'll feed on
[SPEAKER_02]: it less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also collected the damaged
tissue because specialized metabolites are
[SPEAKER_02]: usually accumulated at the feeding site.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been found to be true in some
recent studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also photographed some of these
damaged tissue, hopefully to calculate a
[SPEAKER_02]: damaged leaf area index in the future with
software.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is about the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are neonates.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are about one day old.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they hatched, we put them on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red ones are African.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cyan ones are the NYX lines that he
improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray ones are the X Plant Variety
Protection Act lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green ones, the MP706, the Resistant
Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the blue one is B706.
[SPEAKER_02]: B703, the reference genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I did the ANOVA analysis,
bummer, no significant difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look at the sample sizes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little bit all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also see that we have some
extreme outliers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are not entering the data wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were fat caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we need to do some more reps or
improve our methods on this type of assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also want to do a choice performance
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put 14 inbred leaf discs in a tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put 100 neonates in there and then did
10 replicates for most of the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We scored a day later and then measured
the number of caterpillars on a disc and
[SPEAKER_02]: then assigned them a damage score from 0
to 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that there's variation
between the lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are definitely getting munched on
more than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of Nick's lines here are doing
pretty well versus the Resistant MP706.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look at the,
so the orange bars are the damage scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sorted by damage score from least damage
to most damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the caterpillar weights are in
cyan, or the number of caterpillars I
[SPEAKER_02]: should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in cyan and they're kind of all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an MP706 and there's B73.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did a ANOVA and a Tukey's HSD
test, these three lines, MP706 and two of
[SPEAKER_02]: the improved lines, were significantly
better than B73.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were not any significantly
different than MP706.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are probably pretty good
candidates to move forward since they do
[SPEAKER_02]: just as well with the Resistant line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've just looked at some
historical data to try and nail down some
[SPEAKER_02]: QTF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna fly through this because I'm out
of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, Nick had some other scores
from the field in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use these scores as a phenotypic
trait to try and map things with the GWAS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had sets from both the NAM
recombinant inbred lines and the maze
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity panel, which is about 280 lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see, this is just a
sample from 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a generalized linear model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were practicing with TASL, I admit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only use the original 1144 SNPs
from the NAM set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the diversity panel, we used our
RefGen V1 HapMap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of an outdated version of SNP
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that some peaks are sort
of showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some are the same and some are
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the conclusions here is that the
phenotypic data, we need to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: quantitative because it needs to show less
variance, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could do that by lyophilizing
catapult for weighing, imaging software,
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary metabolites, gene expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the association mapping,
the models need to be improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to run some mixed linear models,
read on with higher SNP density,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also to account for kinship and
environmental covariates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't fit everyone I needed to thank
on one slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rachel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't move around too much from what
I've read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to think about that experimental
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We either have to have a sealed off room
with moths flying around because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want them getting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how rapidly these evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should have this discussion with
George.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he would know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a geopolitical thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there must be BTN breads out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the MP lines are pretty resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we want to be growing in
Africa is the Mississippi lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did try to do some crosses in African
germplasm this year in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growing degree days were too long.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
