[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I wanted to do,
being that this is not an entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd, is do a little bit of Lady Beetle
101.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is just to say that often you'll
hear Lady Bugs, or in most of the world
[SPEAKER_02]: the vernacular is Lady Bird or Lady Bird
Beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all the same there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the family Coxinella Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are important predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bugs or birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not all ladies there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about half and half the sex ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I was pondering how I wanted to
approach this talk, it occurred to me that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's been, so what I work with is
native Lady Beetles, and I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: them especially, and immigrant Lady
Beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it occurred to me that there's been a
lot in the news lately about immigration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe this relatively simple realm
of international politics could be a model
[SPEAKER_02]: for the more complex world of Lady Beetle
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just set up a little dichotomy
here of thinking about the foreign Lady
[SPEAKER_02]: Beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they hardworking immigrants that are
doing this important ecological service?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they bad hombres?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just see about how different
people define those terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can play that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also the millions of women and
men whose names history may not remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: but whose actions help make us who we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who built this country, hand by hand,
brick by brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and for you younger people,
this is our past president, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's the idea that immigrants are
these hardworking immigrants that have
[SPEAKER_02]: helped build this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be one way that Lady
Beetles function.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's another way to think about
immigrants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Amber is here, and we're going to get
them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so there's the dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these immigrants, these hardworking,
individuals that have helped build the
[SPEAKER_02]: country?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they bad hombres that we need to
get out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of what I want to do is think
about Lady Beetles in that context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on what the answer is,
it'll maybe point the way that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: optimally manage or conserve those
creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so in general, insects are very
hardworking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they provide a lot of ecological
services that we need everywhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, they do those services
without a lot of input from us,
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as they're not hindered in those
roles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2006, Mace Vaughan and I,
who was a graduate of Cornell,
[SPEAKER_02]: estimated the economic value of the
ecological services that insects provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the value of services,
the ones we estimated were just for native
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you added the ones that have been
imported, it would be probably double.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one, obviously, that I focus on are
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their main role is in biological
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the only biological control
agent, although they're an important one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other members of this family also feed
on fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do some decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be food for wildlife,
those that aren't chemically protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can play a role in pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollination's not just bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, this is just ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another big aspect that you can think of
other insect groups, bees notably for
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination, beetles and flies for
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to focus again on just the
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so thinking first about what role
ladybugs are playing in our country,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially foreign ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ladybugs can eat a lot of different,
it's mostly soft bodied prey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can feed on the eggs of a lot of
different agricultural pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can feed on larva.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their favorite food is aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the biggest and most recent
aphid pests in the US is the soybean
[SPEAKER_02]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so soybean aphid shown here,
we have a foreign crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not originally from North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a foreign pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not surprisingly, the top four
coccinellids, and actually, if I wax into
[SPEAKER_02]: coccinellids, that's the same as ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top four species that provide
suppression of this pest are all
[SPEAKER_02]: foreigners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all brought in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that sense, this is a good example
of them being hardworking immigrants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're playing this really important
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a sense, they've been reconnected.
[SPEAKER_02]: With something that they would have eaten
back in its home range.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so this is what we would hope to see
with a foreign lady beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should just note that all of these
were brought in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't come in on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all released here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some question about harmonia, whether it
partly came in on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's one good example of an
important system where lady beetles are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about in a broader sense about
how foreign lady beetles do in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: suppressing pests, how effective they are
versus the native lady beetles that were
[SPEAKER_02]: here before we brought those in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's one comparison that was done
by one of my grad students, Evan Hogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at the seven spot lady
beetle compared to the nine spot lady
[SPEAKER_02]: beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was looking at predation on the pea
aphid, which is another big aphid pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much in peas, but it's big in
alfalfa and forage crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he found was that the seven spot
does consume significantly more aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes more to drop off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, here is a foreign lady beetle
that's doing even more than the native one
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be in a very similar niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the seven spot, which is one
of the main foreign lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most common lady beetle in the US and
across the world, which I'll come back to,
[SPEAKER_02]: is harmonia axeritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the multicolored Asian lady beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one that I showed on the
leaf eating the soybean aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a very large group, which I was
somewhere a part of, looked at the sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: biology and ecology of this group across
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at predation rates of this
beetle and combine that with the predation
[SPEAKER_02]: rates of the seven spot and other foreign
species, compared to what it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been for native species, you can come up
with this index, which is how much
[SPEAKER_02]: potential is there for pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do with a little bit how
they forage, but mostly with the veracity,
[SPEAKER_02]: what their predation rate is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can look at how the coccinella
complex has changed over time and then
[SPEAKER_02]: calculate this index over time for all
those different species and see how the
[SPEAKER_02]: suppression potential has changed as these
foreign species have gotten more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that index.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just shows, I won't go into exactly
how you calculate it, but it just shows
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you look at how the species
composition changes and you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: their predation rates are, which most are
published, the herbivore suppression
[SPEAKER_02]: potential has gone up as the proportion of
foreign lady beetles has increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is evidence that we've got
some really hardworking immigrants.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a very basic level, there's more
herbivore suppression potential than there
[SPEAKER_02]: was before we had those foreign lady
beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of the good side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's think about what's the evidence
for the other side of the coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody said these look like
blueberries, and they do, but actually
[SPEAKER_02]: this is grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, again, our friend,
Harmonia axuretis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that it does doesn't
actually have to do with pest suppression,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in the fall, right when they're
getting near harvest time, the Harmonia
[SPEAKER_02]: will get on ripe grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way the harvesting works,
the Harmonia get harvested along with the
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes, and it gets pulled into the vats
where they're going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people come with their bare feet and
squash them, and they're going to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: wine, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one aspect of a lot of lady
beetles, but it's especially pronounced
[SPEAKER_02]: with Harmonia, is they have something
called reflex bleeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they get hassled or molested in
any way, they exude this sticky,
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow, really smelly substance from their
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when they get harvested along with
the grapes, that gets into the wine,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's called taint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it loses its value and in some
cases becomes unsellable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, we've had students in our
IPM class actually do this and put
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels of the taint in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must not be a wine connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't taste it that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, he's originally from Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could just, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it shows I'm generally drinking
too low of a quality of wine to make any
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is that here is one negative
aspect of potentially of this foreign
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing on the sort of negative
side, and again, it's called the
[SPEAKER_02]: multicolored Asian lady beetle,
so I call it the multicolored menace,
[SPEAKER_02]: is if you have ever had ladybugs in your
home or seen them in a building,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are almost inevitably this Asian lady
beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one lady beetle that has the
behavior of coming into houses or
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the native species did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so does it really do a lot of damage?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a structural pest, and it doesn't
transmit disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it gets in these densities,
it's a nuisance pest, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can put out its yellow reflex
bleeding substance, and that can stain
[SPEAKER_02]: different materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a very small but apparently growing
segment of the population is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: allergic to the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, again, that's vanishingly small,
but there are people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, again, is on the bad side.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple points on the good and
a couple points on the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to step back a little bit and
just look at another aspect beyond just
[SPEAKER_02]: direct interactions with humans for the
bad side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, if you look at the closed
circles here, that's the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: adventive or foreign species coming into
the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it's just going up and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are species that established.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been several others that were
released but haven't established.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you look at the open circles,
that is the proportion of native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see, even early on,
these foreign ones didn't do a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had almost 100% natives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then starting here, you really started
to get this dip where you've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: really low numbers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what is causing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's some interaction
here between the foreign species and the
[SPEAKER_02]: native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Admittedly, this is like right around when
disco music was popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of bad stuff happened there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are the foreign species having an
impact on native species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would be more evidence that
maybe they're being bad ombres.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to sort of go on with the idea
that if you look at the two time periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: early on, you had almost 100% natives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, in the later time period,
it's much lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are significantly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a significant change in
the proportion of native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have gone down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in one way, what I say is beware the
deceptive denominator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is that maybe
what's happening is there are just more
[SPEAKER_02]: lady beetles out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be what you would hope,
is that you're bringing in these foreign
[SPEAKER_02]: lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you have more niches because
you've got different crops or you have
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the proportion of natives is maybe
going down just because now you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I thought about that,
or one way that we addressed that is by
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at there aren't many, but there
are several long-term studies in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: system where you can look at the density
of coxanelids or lady beetles pre-invasion
[SPEAKER_02]: or pre-release of the foreign ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can look at it after.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if what's happening is that the
foreign ones are just adding to the total,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you would expect densities to be
higher after.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the densities aren't higher after,
it implies that it's sort of a zero-sum
[SPEAKER_02]: game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if the proportion of natives is
going down, and it's a zero-sum game,
[SPEAKER_02]: it means they're declining, and that's
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to illustrate historical reference,
Zoroastrians were at some point chased out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Iran.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're an interesting group because
they were absolutely pluralistic and
[SPEAKER_02]: accepting of all kinds of races and
religions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were sort of excluded or
chased out of Iran.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to India, but they didn't speak
the language.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the way that the story
goes, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since they didn't speak the language,
they wanted to come in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leader of India gave them this full
glass or bowl of milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he meant to imply, we're all full up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, there's no room for you here in
India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they did is they added sugar to
the bowl and gave it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea was, and this is the idea
with lady beetles too, is that they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: change the volume of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just were able to add something to
the system that made it sweeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the idea with biocontrol,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not trying to make it overflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just trying to add something to the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that indeed what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are bringing in foreign lady
beetles, do you now see higher densities?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the long-term studies,
and there's actually like a confidence
[SPEAKER_02]: interval here that didn't come out very
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that the sort of,
so this is in a proportion, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the top of the line here
is the density post foreign lady beetle
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the original density,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it's one, it means it didn't
change at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's lower, it means the density went
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's higher, it means the density went
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look across all these different
studies, and you do this in a way that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can statistically combine them all,
then what you find is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: the density hasn't gone up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it appears that it is sort of a
zero-sum game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the proportion of natives is going
down across a lot, that we have lots more
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that aren't long-term in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's going down, it appears that
they're really declining.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not just being added to by the
foreign species.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the overall trend, is that when
the foreign ones come in, the native ones
[SPEAKER_02]: decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's look at one specific example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody know what this one is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody know what species this is?
[SPEAKER_02]: You all should know what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a entomology crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the nine-spot lady beetle,
Coxonella novum notata.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you should all know what that is is
because it is our official state insect in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just lady beetle, as this species
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got one split spot here,
four on each side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got this black line down the middle,
which is fairly unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got across the neck shield,
white, and then white all the way across
[SPEAKER_02]: the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it the milk mustache.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those are very characteristic of this
one species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has sort of been our flagship
species for the lost ladybug project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one that's really declined.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at its former range,
it used to be essentially everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very, very common throughout
North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's declined.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some of the few back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the only places it had been
found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those places, only a couple of
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within a few decades, a really sharp
and rapid decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem is, how do you deal with,
how do you get data on a species that's
[SPEAKER_02]: declined so quickly over such a broad
area?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we came up with is this idea of
the lost ladybug project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lost ladybug project is a citizen
science project where we educate people
[SPEAKER_02]: about lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we recruit them to go out and take
pictures and submit those back to us
[SPEAKER_02]: through the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have that data set of what's
happening both with the natives and the
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beauty of doing this with ladybugs
is that we can identify almost 90% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: images that come into species,
because it's all about the spot pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few species that's not true
and they're tougher.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly, we can do that, even if the
pictures aren't that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a group of young students actually
won Jane Goodall's Roots and Shoots Young
[SPEAKER_02]: Filmmaker Contest with this film about
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just play a little bit of it,
because it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tells about how the project works.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that pretty?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's almost over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little guitar at the end.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of simple animation, but really
telling, I think, a lot of important
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons there about what's happening with
ladybugs and how to do the project and
[SPEAKER_02]: what their role is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using this and other ways of
recruiting, we've gotten almost I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we're up to almost 40,000 identified
images of lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for each of those images, we have
where and when it was collected and what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of habitat it was collected in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do we get sort of different data
from this citizen science project than we
[SPEAKER_02]: do from conventional surveys or
conventional science?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons is that we tend to
get a lot of singletons.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will be out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They find a ladybug.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've heard of the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: They send that in.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is that the citizen
science data tends to be broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the conventional science data tends to
be deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you tend to get very intense samples at
a few locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Citizen science, you get lots of samples
from lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just shows that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellow dots are where, at that point,
this has actually been quite a while back,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we got submissions from spotter
submissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pink were the surveys,
and not surprisingly, clustered mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: around universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other nice thing is that when you talk
about the LLP, lost ladybug project,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost all of the observations come from
non-ag situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not necessarily going out in ag
farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only 8% from ag situations,
it's almost exactly flipped for
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional science, where most of the
surveys that you find for conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: science are coming from ag fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that add up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for our nine spot, for C.
[SPEAKER_02]: novum notata, if you look at the C.
[SPEAKER_02]: novum notata per 1,000 observations,
you're tending to find, not tending to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get significantly more per observation
that they find this rare species.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes across several rare species than
you do through the conventional science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is partly because they're so
dispersed, and partly because they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different habitats.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we find?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a quick model that we ran,
looking across what we know of their
[SPEAKER_02]: densities over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's obviously, or maybe not
obvious, but this was a projected one.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are actually the data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that looks pretty dire,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on that, oh, so let me just stop
it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the broad scale data that we
get from the lost ladybug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to make these kind of,
combined with published literature,
[SPEAKER_02]: it allows us to make these kinds of models
of what's happening to its decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we can get from the
lost ladybug project is when a spotter,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what we call our volunteers,
finds a rare species, we can go out and
[SPEAKER_02]: collect with them, or sometimes they can
send us some live specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get those in the lab, and then we
can start to do directed experiments on
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe why the species is declining.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of my favorite spotters,
Allison Yates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been maybe like five years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she found the nine spot in her
backyard in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to fly out, and she was
pointing it out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great if you've ever been out
with kids, collecting, and you know this
[SPEAKER_02]: rare species is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're out in the yard, and she's
like, wow, and I'm like, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's found one, and she says,
look, it's a spider.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, well, OK, good, but keep
looking for the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually we found what we needed,
and we brought those back, and we're able
[SPEAKER_02]: to establish a colony.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what has, based on that, what have we
found?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things is that if you look
at the pre-release or pre-establishment of
[SPEAKER_02]: the seventh spot, which is a close cousin
of the ninth spot, the ninth spot was
[SPEAKER_02]: ranked third, and it had a relative
abundance of 7%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem that high, but there's
lots of ladybugs out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a relative abundance across
a lot of habitats of 7%, you're a player.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in pre-73, there were no seventh
spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you come to the current time,
the relative abundance is actually now
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 1% and ranks down at 15th,
which means you're sort of also ran.
[SPEAKER_02]: And relative abundance of the seventh spot
now 21%, and it's the second most common
[SPEAKER_02]: lady beetle behind only the Asian one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that it's this species that
has caused the decline of the ninth spot,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we think at least the timing lines up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look at some of the experiments
we've done to try to see, is that really
[SPEAKER_02]: the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing is there for the seventh spot
having had impact on the ninth spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there evidence for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first things we found is
that sometimes you get nine spots that
[SPEAKER_02]: really only have seven spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you get a good seven spot
species, but it's got these two ghost
[SPEAKER_02]: spots on it, making it more like a nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started to wonder, maybe it's
not really good species.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a continuum of good species.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a continuum of forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they hybridized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're thinking, that's just wacky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Species can't hybridize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is an endangered salamander and an
introduced salamander.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they mate, they can have viable
offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those viable offspring are actually
the most fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could get a hybrid that's replacing
the native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're saying, well, that can't happen
with insects, but it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can get the viceroy and the
white admiral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it leads to a viable hybrid of
the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we certainly see the spotted form and
the spotless form.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a spotless nine spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that seems counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they mate, and so even though the
forms look really different, they can
mutate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mate, and they can have viable
offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I often ask kids when I go out to
different schools, if a nine spot and a
[SPEAKER_02]: seven spot mated, what would you expect
the offspring to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people say eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they say 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do we actually find?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing, and I wasn't sure if
everybody was going to be 21, so I covered
[SPEAKER_02]: this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we find is that, in fact,
we found this in Oregon, when we made one
[SPEAKER_02]: of those first collecting trips,
that we put nines and sevens in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they started doing the nasty,
the deed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just in case you don't believe it,
I actually turn away if you're squeamish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nine spot and the seven spot can
absolutely mate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned the sound down just because that
would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can mate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so clearly, here's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actually coming out with this
publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that not only is
hybridization the key to lady beetle
[SPEAKER_02]: decline, it's also the key to colony
collapse disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we found in the lab this lady
beetle, and it's the hybrid of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can they mate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they hybridize?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll lay eggs, but the eggs are never
viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there interference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer to this, and there's a lot
more data.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Leo Stelweg could come and give a
whole talk on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's good evidence that even though
they don't hybridize, that if a nine spot
[SPEAKER_02]: female gets mated by a seven spot male,
she becomes less receptive to males of her
[SPEAKER_02]: own species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of her reproductive potential is
being tied up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means that there could be a
mating interference or reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: interference that's one cause of why
they're declining.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be more and more important as
the nine spots, for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: get less and less common relative to the
sevens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the chance that they'll be courted
by a seven spot male goes higher and
[SPEAKER_02]: higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so possibility for interference,
but not hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that happens beyond the
mating is that the nine spot and the seven
[SPEAKER_02]: spot have different life histories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is maybe not the, I could have
done a more exciting graph from this
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, but this is the seven spot,
and this is two populations of the nine
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only point that I want to make
here is that the seven spot develops more
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly in the seven spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the same temperature,
same diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that could give it some sort of an
edge in competitive interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you are developing more
quickly, it means you're getting bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, if you look in the field,
this isn't necessarily following one from
[SPEAKER_02]: the other, but here's what we find for
collections in the field in terms of size
[SPEAKER_02]: of the nine spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So P1's meaning the ones that we directly
collected from the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nine spots that you find in the field
are smaller than the seven spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also smaller than the nine spots
offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you bring them into the lab and feed
them all they want, they grow up to be
[SPEAKER_02]: much larger than they are now in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which implies, and there's evidence to
support that, I don't have time to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: here, but that they're being relegated to
suboptimal habitats by the seven spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you look at the size of the
nine spots that you collect now versus
[SPEAKER_02]: from a whole slew of collections,
pin specimens, they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something is happening in the field to
the size of the nine spots and we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a direct correlation between
size and fecundity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're smaller, meaning they're going
to have lower reproductive output.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what happens if you pair them up,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what Rakim Turnipse did,
another grad student in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a little bit hard to read,
but this is again the western population
[SPEAKER_02]: and the eastern population.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the white circles, it's paired with
[SPEAKER_02]: C7 at low aphid density and then this is
C9 at high aphid density.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just cut to the chase here when you,
in fact here, this will really cut to the
[SPEAKER_02]: chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you rear a nine spot with a seven
spot rather than one of its own species,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get significantly lower survival rates
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it appears that there's good evidence
for the nine spot being either outcompeted
[SPEAKER_02]: for food or in many cases this happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, the fitness of this individual is
low, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very happy seven spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a, well it's not unhappy anymore,
nine spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's evidence then that based on
the timing, based on potential
[SPEAKER_02]: reproductive interference, based on the
differential life histories, and based on
[SPEAKER_02]: all of our competition studies that the
seven spot is actually outcompeting and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes eating the nine spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oops, in that sense, these foreign
lady beetles at least are bad hombres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so back to the original question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are foreign lady beetles hardworking
immigrants or bad hombres?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is clearly yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are hardworking immigrants and
they're doing a lot of valuable biological
[SPEAKER_02]: control, but they're also bad hombres in
the sense that they're coming into houses,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming on grapes, and they're apparently
causing the decline of a lot of native
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on that, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How should we react to that situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing that they're here, we probably
can't get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We not necessarily would want to,
but yet we want to keep the diversity in
[SPEAKER_02]: the coccinellid complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things that's happened
is just, this has been two years ago now,
[SPEAKER_02]: the New York DEC has made the nine spot
lady beetle and three others species of
[SPEAKER_02]: greatest conservation need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in the state, it's listed as a
species that is in need of conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: More recently, this just happened about
midway through last year, Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Committee on the Status of Endangered
Wildlife in Canada, recommended that the
[SPEAKER_02]: nine spot be listed as an endangered
species in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's cool is this is based partly
on, in fact I'll say mostly, on lost
[SPEAKER_02]: ladybug project data, both from the US and
we have a lot of observations from Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is now, has gone to, the way it
works there, this committee recommends it
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it goes to a government agency
that puts it out for comment from the
[SPEAKER_02]: different provinces and we expect within
three or four months, it'll actually be
[SPEAKER_02]: listed then there as an endangered
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so should we, based on this,
what should our larger reaction be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly you don't really want predators,
natural enemies coming in and wreaking
[SPEAKER_02]: havoc on the native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So should we just stop doing this sort of
biocontrol or really put heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: restrictions on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought we should have some
wisdom on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ben Frank, this is often misquoted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, should we just give it
up and not do it anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's the actual quote from Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who give up essential pest
suppression to obtain a little temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: safety deserve neither freedom from pests
or safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, he's actually releasing some
ladybugs right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing that we got a color picture of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that classical biological
control is too valuable of a tool to just
[SPEAKER_02]: throw out even though there's some
evidence that there's bad interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a lot of cases, if you didn't have
classical biological control, you'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing either just letting the pests go and
that could have impact on non-targets or
[SPEAKER_02]: you're probably gonna turn to something
else like pesticides which is gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: an interaction as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what should we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things, at least two things to think
about is testing, pre-testing of release
[SPEAKER_02]: that includes looking at impacts on other
predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't much, if any, of that done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a really intense testing done if
you're gonna do an herbivore that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna release to control a plant,
much less and much less structured if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna release something that's
going after herbivores itself like these
[SPEAKER_02]: ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call that extreme vetting of the
predators that you might wanna.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made that term up, I coined that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing we could do is
conservation measures that will facilitate
[SPEAKER_02]: all lady beetle species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rising tide raises all boats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got the foreign ones here,
you've got the native ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did these conservation measures,
you could help all those species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Tony told me I had to include a weed
science article in this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, this is an article that he and I
just recently published.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the cover which is a,
it's a figure from the paper and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: wanna point out this is the last hard copy
cover of weed science ever and this figure
[SPEAKER_02]: was drawn by an undergrad at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Christine was the main reason we got
this done after 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should really recognize.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an idea he and I had been kicking
around but weren't able to get done until
[SPEAKER_02]: she came on board and whipped us into
shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but the point is that this looks at
one possibility for conserving beneficials
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field is thinking about weeds not
just as weeds but also as a resource for
[SPEAKER_02]: these beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is that based on conditions,
you might actually shift what your level
[SPEAKER_02]: is that you're gonna pull the trigger on
using an herbivore on a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, you can actually
conserve a lot of the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll leave that, this could be a
whole nother talk in itself, has been in
[SPEAKER_02]: fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, another implication for
conservation, redistribution of the rare
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get them back out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at doing that by being
able to sell at cost rare species that we
[SPEAKER_02]: raise in the lab to gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And organic growers especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to wrap it up sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just go, I have like another
half hour really but I'll wrap it up in 30
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all implications for sort of
continental or the scale of the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also more of an international
problem with harmonia and harmonia being
[SPEAKER_02]: taking over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this looks like fireworks but really
it just shows that now 50% of all lady
[SPEAKER_02]: beetles are harmonia exoritus across the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a measure of called effective
species and it's a look at how much
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity there is and how much we're
losing, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that high density means that they are,
that harmonia exoritus is at risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually people have identified two
pathogens that could take this species
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do that, it could leave a real
hole and we could have a problem with pest
[SPEAKER_02]: suppression in that there might not be
enough native species to take up the
[SPEAKER_02]: slack, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a food security risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what do we do for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about national implications,
international implications, organize,
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborate, protect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with the IUCN.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a plan to try to do that
internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have started a specialist group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to point out especially our
Russian member of the group and why I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to point that out is because he
works at the Vavilov Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vavilov, one of the first people that
looked at conservation of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Note all these people were at the Vavilov
Institute and I'll just do one more
[SPEAKER_02]: minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I bring them up is because
they were there when the Nazis came in in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1941, Siege of Leningrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there in this huge storehouse of
seeds and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people starved to death rather
than eating the seeds and potatoes to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect that diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So later, after they gave their lives to
protect that, Vladimir Putin, I think this
[SPEAKER_02]: is 2008, 2009, tried to get rid of that
whole institute and a lot of it was
[SPEAKER_02]: planted in trees that could never have
been salvaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened was that Cornell and
Polish researchers along with huge
[SPEAKER_02]: petitions internationally went out and it
was saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not get rid of this institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my final message is we are here facing
a similar situation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's time for us to speak out as
well and we've got huge problems that are
[SPEAKER_02]: international in scope, global in scope,
global warming, loss of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way we're going to solve those is
by international collaboration and if we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't speak out, we're not going to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The literature about conserving rare
species and what that does in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem function, ecological function,
and particularly in your case of looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the seven versus the nine spotted,
as I understand they have mostly the same
[SPEAKER_00]: niche space and they're doing a similar
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be the detriment of this
non-native replacing the native other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the native isn't there anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's a reasonable question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things that's
happened is that we've gone from
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-establishment of the foreign species
where there was a really even and diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: set of native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gone from that in just a few
decades to a complex that's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: dominated by two cosmopolitan species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in a strict biological control
sense, there is no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, maybe it's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the concern is that if
anything ever happened to the two dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: species, there might not be enough
diversity to take up the slack.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were there and always doing their
thing, it might not be so bad that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could make the argument not clear yet that
they're not hitting all the niches as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as the diverse complex did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, if they took a nosedive and
went down the tubes, then you want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough diversity there to pick up the
slack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is that a lot of times you can
have an invasive come in, the natives
[SPEAKER_02]: tank, but then eventually they
re-equilbrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we could assist that recovery,
then we might get back to a more stable
[SPEAKER_02]: state for something which we don't know is
ever going to happen, but we think is a
[SPEAKER_02]: risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just touching on that assisting the
recovery part of it, I don't really know
[SPEAKER_03]: how decisions are made in terms of who
gets released to where.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's how many athens per square
centimeter you can eat in a given time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're doing with rearing in the
lab, are they native's harder to rear,
[SPEAKER_03]: harder to get?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't they more part of release
systems than some of these battle break?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are no foreign ones being
released anymore, foreign lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The foreign ones were specifically brought
over because there were, first it was
[SPEAKER_02]: Russian wheat aphid mostly for the seventh
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a number of, the harmonium was
supposed to go after pests on sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: woody ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea with why they were brought in
is not because they were easier to rear,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because they were seen as more
voracious and maybe more attuned to these
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign pests that were on foreign crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about equally easy to rear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you find now, if you Google and you
want to buy lady bugs and to release them,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the lady bugs that you are going to
get are one species, Hippodamia
[SPEAKER_02]: convergens, a native species that's all
collected in the mountains of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go over and they estimate up in those
mountains in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people come with these bucket things
and just scoop them up by the thousands,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's okay, except there's three,
well there are several problems with using
[SPEAKER_02]: those as opposed to maybe trying to
re-release these rare ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is they don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't work very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just fly off and they don't tend to
suppress the pests very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two is that they're in such high density
numbers they could introduce diseases
[SPEAKER_02]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third is that there's concern that
by just releasing them from this one area
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're adapted to, that they're
going to spread sub-optimal genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we do our rear and sales and
release program, what we're doing is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's called the local lady bug project,
is we have populations from about five
[SPEAKER_02]: places and we're rearing them and so
you're always getting the lady bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully more locally adapted than the
California ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, with that, let's thank John for a
great talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
