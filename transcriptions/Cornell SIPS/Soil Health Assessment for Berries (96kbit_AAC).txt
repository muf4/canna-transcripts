[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're logged into the 8th of 12 Berry
Soil Nutrient Management Webinar,
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by the Northeast Sustainable
Research and Education Program,
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast SARE, and hosted by Cornell
University Department of Horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kathy Heidenreich, and I'm
going to be your moderator, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: temporarily, as Jeff Miller from Oneida
County Cooperative Extension is having
[SPEAKER_00]: audio issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he gets so straightened out,
he'll be back with us shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be starting in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we begin, I want to remind everyone
that you can put any comments or questions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chat box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let you know that Bob has
uploaded a file to the file box,
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil Health Testing and Adaptive
Management 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a paper that he wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be telling us more about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remind you about the web links,
Northeast SARE is there in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: right, and the webinar archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've missed any of the previous
webinar webinars, you'll be able to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: that link and listen to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that you can shift to full screen
during the presentation if you'd prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: not to be distracted by what's going on,
maybe over on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit the full screen button,
you'll see just the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, if you want to have some
other input, the little fellow on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the screen with his hand in the air,
there's several options there for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some sort of a comment through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I hope everyone is in and warm and
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty snowy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty serious weather warning
out there, so drive carefully on the way
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll introduce our speaker
for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our speaker is Mr. Robert Schindelbeck,
better known as Bob, and Bob is an
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension Associate in the Department of
Crop and Soil Science at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has responsibilities in research,
teaching, and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob coordinates the Cornell Soil Health
Lab operations and has been a part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Soil Health team's development of
soil and soil management strategies to
[SPEAKER_00]: address laboratory measured soil
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's produced numerous peer-reviewed and
extension articles and has delivered over
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 presentations related to tillage,
soil compaction, and soil quality at
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers Twilight meetings and professional
conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob is going to talk to us today about
soil health assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to this opportunity to
share with you some information about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell Soil Health Test and how it could
apply to berries and how it does apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should start out with some very basic
introductory ideas because I think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: very useful in the whole context of
developing testing, soil health testing in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, in a new field like berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a formalized soil health test
yet for berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be something that is very
specific to berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the course of this
presentation, what I'll try to do is bring
[SPEAKER_01]: up issues and points that would allow a
shift in the focus of the test away from
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables, which is what it was designed
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: To more specifically, to berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily limit the utility
of the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that it could be ever better for
berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we started the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually began offering this test back
in 2007 to the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done thousands of samples on both
research and commercial farms in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: and throughout the entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get samples from all over, including
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've learned an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: An awful lot about soil health testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think this is a good opportunity
to, as I say, disseminate this into the
[SPEAKER_01]: berry realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to be building on some of
the ideas that Harold Van Ness presented
[SPEAKER_01]: back in, I guess it was October of 2011,
to the Berry Group called Introduction to
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil Management in Berry Production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to acknowledge, too,
first of all, we always talk about soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health, our soil health group as a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very important concept to
keep in mind that as a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: interested, concerned scientists and
educators and growers and field staff,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much we can bring to bear if we
can have a common goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sure what happened here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed some folks that were on our
core team from its inception back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harold Van Ness, of course, I work
directly with Harold in CSS, Bianca Mobius
[SPEAKER_01]: Clune, John E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dao Wu.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's now at New Mexico State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the crop and soils folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then George Bowie and his then
graduate student, Beth Gugino in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought a lot of information to bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave Wolf over in horticulture,
a real soil biology expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all kind of got together and kind of
shared a common goal to kind of understand
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these soil health concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, without the growers and
extension educators and field staff to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of focus us and keep us on track,
sometimes it's easy to get lost in
[SPEAKER_01]: minutiae.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just had a really good run of a
really good team of people where we could
[SPEAKER_01]: really iron out some nice ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of important funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Northeast Region SARE, we got two
large grants from them, 03 to 06,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 06 to 09, which is really where we're
able to do the foundational work for this
[SPEAKER_01]: support from the Northern New York ADP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a research firm up at Willsboro
where a lot of beta testing went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The New York Farm Viability Institute
helped us tremendously with funding
[SPEAKER_01]: support, even with a subsidy for New York
growers to participate in the soil health
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, IPM helped fund a long-term
research up at Geneva under George Bowie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's where I'll stop with
all the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so what is soil health?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Harold might have shown this
slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to realize that when we
talk about something like health and its
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity to function, these are very
qualitative terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soil quality, they're qualitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, as scientists, we want to measure
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be quantitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of a challenge to measure a
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll show how we go about that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so with a healthy soil,
I would say they're somewhat easy to even
[SPEAKER_01]: spot at a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of know what a good soil,
again, qualitatively looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've listed some ideas here,
some important features of a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got good tilth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's very qualitative, sufficient
nutrients, depth, stores water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have disease organisms,
good populations of beneficial organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really, at bottom, resistance to being
degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can grab my arrow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance to being degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a resilience, a quick recovery from
adverse events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of extreme weather anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your better soils, at a glance,
the healthier soils, they just rebound
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plants are less stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, general signs of poor soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can kind of see that something's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would say something's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what exactly is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, we'd list these qualitative
features.
[SPEAKER_01]: They often come up claddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd say the soil's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a lot of runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water doesn't seem to go in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't germinate well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, declining of yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really want to do, then,
is find out more specifically what is
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the soil, what is actually not
functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to keep in mind while we do
that, as scientists, we're reductionists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to put a very sharp point on
every idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet these ideas still have to exist in an
interactive world, in an ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to keep this in mind that as we
deconstruct and go way down into
[SPEAKER_01]: specifics, we never want to lose sight of
the fact that these specifics operate in a
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This complexity of interaction between
these different arenas of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: physicality, chemical, and soil biology is
really part of what I call nature's
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all interdependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk a little about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of this interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Harold had talked about this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see a hard soil with reduced
rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of highlighted in blue
here some of these physical factors to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of talk about a compacted dense layer
restricts a rooting volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the plant can't extend its roots
into a large volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's an extended drought,
there's less water to draw upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, this compacted soil
causes a reduction in beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: biological processes because of lack of
aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see how there's this kind of a,
it's not necessarily a straightforward,
[SPEAKER_01]: simple effect of what does hard soil do in
hard soil reducing rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to suggest here is all
these concepts kind of go in under this
[SPEAKER_01]: hard soil reducing rooting heading.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is we want to keep all these
ideas in mind simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want our RAM filled with these sort
of accessory ideas that kind of support
[SPEAKER_01]: this concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we'll need that to understand just
what's going on then.
[SPEAKER_01]: For understanding the soil testing as well
as then ultimately the soil management.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to some soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may recognize Carol McNeil.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a vegetable crop specialist in many
counties in central New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standing here in front of a grower field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it has some issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: This field actually tested very high in
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see, this stands very poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are really suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see here is, if you notice
right in front of Carol, some key issues
[SPEAKER_01]: that one thing that our soil's
investigation showed us was that the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: was used very intensively by the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time we saw that organic matter,
he saw the organic matter was decreasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was getting tighter and denser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water wasn't getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil was becoming quote unquote
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use it, you till it, you loosen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it quickly gets back in this
condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, of course, intuitively know that
there's more going on here than a lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil fertility per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just exactly what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the sort of thing that really
interested us at the beginning on our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil's team to kind of get at just what is
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more information in our soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I show how we use soil nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemical testing and nutrient
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I show a strawberry test here taken from
some Molly Shaw's work where we can test
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil in something like a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can even do foliar testing for these
high value crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as on the right here, I show a
picture of a soil report where we get the,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a modified Morgan extraction,
where we get the actual levels of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they low, medium, high rankings?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even a recommendation on what to
add.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've come a long way in soil nutrient
testing and recommendations over the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, really since World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to this ecology here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to come back to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a philosophy of recognizing
that we're going to go beyond just the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the upper right here, the soil chemical
testing, but realize that it's a really a
[SPEAKER_01]: three legged stool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got soil, there's a physical
environment and a biological environment
[SPEAKER_01]: that we need to have, all these need to be
sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or again, using our three legged stool
analogy, the stool can tip over based on
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those being weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this kind of gets to part one of
the talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's we want to measure different
aspects of these, of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can identify constrained soil
indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then part two is then what are we going to
do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to use the, this tar apart
reductionist strategy to go into each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these soil arenas one at a time,
but always keeping in mind that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use that same information later
as we put it back, put this information
[SPEAKER_01]: back together toward dealing with our soil
and managing it in the best way we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, I'm going to start with the
soil chemical testing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see here is the, in soil chemical
testing, a very important issue of pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH controls the solubility of a lot of
metals and just a lot of nutrients in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the soil is a really a chemical
repository of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving down to the biological arena,
we also know that the soil is also a
[SPEAKER_01]: repository of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this cycle of life, for example,
decomposing organic matter releases a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this cycling, there's also a lot of
pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, kind of suggesting this kind of
interdependency so that we don't just,
[SPEAKER_01]: we aren't just growing in clean sand and
we're hitting the appropriate chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a living, breathing biological
environment here that's also affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: these chemical levels and responding to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, moving to the physical
arena, I've heard the soil physical
[SPEAKER_01]: structure called the house, where all
these, where the roots live and where all
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil biology, biological processes
take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly the what's listed here kind of
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a place where water and where the
plant can grow, where water can come in
[SPEAKER_01]: and be stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also where water can exchange with air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the soil can breathe and get fresh
oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also a place, the soil is
also a place where all these processes
[SPEAKER_01]: take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this, if it's not, if our house is
badly damaged, then our biology and
[SPEAKER_01]: biological processes, which may release
chemicals to the plant or make chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less available, will be affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, again, we, I want to stress again,
we really can't talk about any one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these without talking about all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we're going to take this
reductionist approach first to deconstruct
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but keeping in mind that we're,
we want to put this all back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've shown here some photos, taken from
our laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the tests that we perform in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk more about these in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to kind of show a picture so
you get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are fairly straightforward tests,
nothing super involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll go through them one at a time
later, but across the top, I show the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: physical tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then across the bottom, soil biological
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the soil nutrient testing
is mentioned in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a modified Morgan extraction to
then score the soil nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go through these now in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's start with this idea of the
soil house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil aggregate, I'm a soil physicist,
I'm very interested in soil aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil crumbs, what you see here are very
small particles of soil, kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: joined together, glued together,
if you will, into a large crumb or an
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's large pores and small pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as a soil physicist, I'm probably
more interested in the void spaces and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in them than the particles
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: These different pores, pore sizes perform
different functions, large pores,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, rapid water intake and
drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then air intake, smaller pores,
of course, store water over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As these smaller pores stay full of water,
this is where the soil organisms would
[SPEAKER_01]: live in that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a model of the soil house.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left here, we see a good soil
structure where we have well aggregated
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that's infiltrating water rapidly
between the particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always want to take in rainwater that
comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, we see as these aggregates
break down, it's actually a surface
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil closes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me use my arrow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can.
I had trouble with it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: As these aggregates then break down,
they end up self-clogging, and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: a surface compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the water can't get in and
exchange as the water moves in,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, air moves out, stale air,
then fresh air can move in behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to definitely protect these
aggregates so that we can have this sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of model function here on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind also that these large
pores are the most sensitive and most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to be destroyed by compactive
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a couple of pictures from the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a field of what we mean by soil
structural breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we've all seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular interest, I think,
is on the bottom left here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a winery in California trying some
different management strategies between
[SPEAKER_01]: these semi-permanent rows of grapes to try
to increase their water intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see on the, I guess, the left side of
that picture how the water is just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: standing at the surface, kind of puddling
up there, whereas in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slide, they've tried some other things
that kind of have the soil loose,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the water seems to be infiltrating
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to show this slide, this picture,
in contrast to, in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pictures just above it, which were
taken from just a more of a vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: field, a potato field, actually,
where we will get to this later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind that when we discuss
these topics, we're going to also have to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss where they're occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across this whole field at the top,
we would sample and test usually the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't necessarily focus our quest for
information, whereas in the winery
[SPEAKER_01]: example, you can see how right next to the
plant, where it would be a very important
[SPEAKER_01]: place to sample in a, for example,
a cornfield, we can't, we aren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: even managing, in this picture,
managing that area in the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, we want to keep in mind that
these processes occur everywhere in a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable field, but more localized in
some of the berry or specialty vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that actually our way of testing
this, the soil structural stability in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, as we use a rainfall simulation,
really, we apply drops, a half inch of
[SPEAKER_01]: raindrops in the course of five minutes
onto some soil crumbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see on the left versus right
here, the sort of result we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom, it shows where these soils
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a long-term research field,
a tillage field up in Willsboro,
[SPEAKER_01]: right on Lake Champlain.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left, you can see where we've,
what that soil kind of looks like being
[SPEAKER_01]: held as herald, holding a clump of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That soil in this picture has been plowed
for 14 years continuously in the fall,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'd plant corn for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, we've seen the soil change
over those 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, we've done the exact same
thing in these replicated plots,
[SPEAKER_01]: except we've produced the corn without
tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of see again
qualitatively that the soil looks,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's the exact same soil,
but the different management even visually
[SPEAKER_01]: is, makes quite a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we, we can actually put a number on
it then, and kind of move into a more,
[SPEAKER_01]: using a number to discriminate what's good
and what's perhaps less good in our
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is very, very demonstrative
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will use this at field days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a smaller version of this that I
go out to the field with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And test it at a, right in a grower's
field, or at a twilight meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you can see very clearly the
sort of inherent structure in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that, how that can suffer under
different management or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, another test is this available water
capacity test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm showing on the right here that
the soil aggregate with the larger and
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention that we, this available
water capacity is defined as the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in water content of the soil at
what we call field capacity and permanent
[SPEAKER_01]: wilting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So field capacity is that magical state
that the soil reaches after about two days
[SPEAKER_01]: after drain, after rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes an equilibrium with gravity
drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to use, you've heard of one third
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York, we like one tenth bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should mention also that tenth bar
pore size corresponds to about 30 microns,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the diameter of the average human
hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a funny way, when gravity's done
draining the soil, all the pores larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, than a human hair are empty
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smaller than that are still contain
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as time goes on, those larger
pores will, in that range, will give up
[SPEAKER_01]: their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: As time goes on with the, towards the end,
the very small pores, the 15 bar pores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be two tenths of a micron in
diameter would finally be the only ones
[SPEAKER_01]: left with any water in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a fairly standard test in a
soil physics lab and rather
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just sort of the underpinnings
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil compaction, you know, we always
want to know in the field how the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: responds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many things, chemical tests,
of course, we can take it, take this soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sample out of the field, test it,
and then come back to the field with this
[SPEAKER_01]: answer and go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But soil hardness is something we really
have to do in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought, oh, wouldn't it be nice if we
could take soil cores from the field or
[SPEAKER_01]: have growers send them in or researchers,
and then we could do soil hardness tests
[SPEAKER_01]: in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we found out pretty quick that that
just is too difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we address that is to use a
soil penetrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see, you see someone using that
at the bottom left side of the picture
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pushed smoothly into the soil from
zero all the way down to 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we record the hardest value
encountered in a zero to six inch depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the hardest value obtained
in this six to 18 inch depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're getting information on then
is zero to six inch corresponds to what we
[SPEAKER_01]: call the plow layer or the surface layer,
or certainly the active layer of roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the subsoil is yet another
environment for long-term storage of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and deeper rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of these, of course, both areas
are, it's important to isolate these two
[SPEAKER_01]: depths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my arrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to isolate these two depths
to understand just where to then,
[SPEAKER_01]: if necessary, focus our management.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see some dense surface soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the roots, again, aren't able to enter
into this hard soil and take advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: the water and nutrients that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down below here, we see on the left,
without subsoil compaction, the roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to to go down and get water nutrients
further down where on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots cannot penetrate that hard layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are confined to growing in this
little pot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's move into the organic or the
soil biological realm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that organic matter is really
the driver of all these soil biological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic matter, if you follow these
arrows around, the first thing it does is
[SPEAKER_01]: by having the character that it does have
and as it changes, it increases biological
[SPEAKER_01]: activity and diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this then, there's a whole host
of effects of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've highlighted in blue through the
middle here, some of these physical
[SPEAKER_01]: processes we just talked about,
how when we increase this soil biological
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, we tend to get more glues that
help hold these soil particles together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get these nice soil crumbs,
this aggregation that are also more
[SPEAKER_01]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, we also then improve our pore
structure by maintaining this aggregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can maintain those larger intermediate
and smaller pores so that they can all do
[SPEAKER_01]: their important functions rather than
losing or having too many of one size and
[SPEAKER_01]: not another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the soil can't handle those
different issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, ultimately, that tilt and
water storage leads us to healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in green, we also have some important
processes that are in more the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the upper left, we see that with this
increased biological activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: we tend to reduce the capacity of these
soil porn diseases and parasitic organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: to function and to have an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, a healthy robust
population kind of minimizes the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: these, if you will, bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, on the right here,
as this soil biological material
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposes, it releases nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It detoxifies harmful substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we also end up generating
humus, another important soil biological
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very interesting slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was put together by a student of
Laura Drinkwaters, quite a few years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: now, over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to categorize organic matter
into three general types that we can then
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the living organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the organisms and the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recently dead material, which is what
I would loosely call the food for the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the active organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the very busy organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forever changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the stuff that's in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, then finally, the very dead
organic matter, in a broad sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really known as humus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, it's also very important to
the soil in terms of just being an
[SPEAKER_01]: important part of that soil house by
loosening and holding water and just being
[SPEAKER_01]: a placeholder and a loosener in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about the first,
we talk about these living organisms in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, realize also that they're dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they're living and dying,
they're providing food for other organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: in this beautiful food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're breaking down organic debris and
releasing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a very complex, beautiful way,
there's a slide here in the upper right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show some fungi colonizing a plant root
right in the rhizosphere here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we're learning more and more
about these sort of relationships where
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungi can greatly increase the surface
area of the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very useful in more perennial plants
to have these beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're often at odds trying to get
their numbers to increase when we do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like this picture of this earthworm
on the bottom right here, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: the context of creating and releasing
glues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about soil bacteria living and
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these bacteria die, each of them can
burst like a, if you will, a water balloon
[SPEAKER_01]: and have this glue inside them that helps
hold these soil particles together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think also that we have to look
right to the earthworm and think of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slime, if you will, that's on the skin of
the earthworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that moves through the soil,
then that slime is kind of rubbing off as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and helping bind those particles
together, which we often see in their
[SPEAKER_01]: casts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just, again, another example of
this interaction of the soil biology
[SPEAKER_01]: leading to increasing that soil physical
aggregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the feedback of that
to having a well-aggregated environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: this house, where the organisms can then
live better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another test we do of the living organisms
is a potentially mineralizable nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an indicator for mineralization of
soil organic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the organic nitrogen is first
mineralized to inorganic ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from ammonium, ultimately,
it gets converted into nitrate for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we decided was that if we could
measure this, the rate of conversion of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nitrogen to ammonium, we would
have a good indicator of soil biological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very important process.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of organisms operate right in the
same realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have good high values of
nitrogen mineralization, then we'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: an indicator of a good soil biological
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a seven-day incubation,
where we look at the ammonium level in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sample at time zero, and then seven days
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another test we do with the living
organisms is a root bioassay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, our test was developed for
really vegetable crops and field crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we made a choice to use this green
bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I should mention this is actually very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green bean variety we use is one
that's very hard to find because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to so many common diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, that's exactly what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each sample is, each soil sample we
receive is planted out in replicates with
[SPEAKER_01]: this bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after four weeks, we then examine
the roots of the bean and look for
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases that this bean and other
vegetables are sensitive to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we score it according to the
scale at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention here that even in our
current context of this test, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: a dairy farmer is very uninterested in
this test.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if he's growing corn for
several years and then going to hay crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: he isn't interested or it's really a moot
point to him if he's got diseases in his
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that this bean would be sensitive to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely it doesn't anyways because there's
no food source for those organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, I think this is a good
place to bring up the idea that in using
[SPEAKER_01]: this soil health testing strategy for
berries or any particular plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where a team of experts can put
their heads together, I think very
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforwardly, and decide is there
another plant we could use that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: do a test like this that would be more
appropriate for our target crop plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a very important test if
you're interested in screening for disease
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it should be selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant should be specific towards the
desired produce plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then now moving to the not living
soil environment so much, but what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: the recently dead or available or what we
call active carbon part of this of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the what I was calling before
that soil the food for the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the material that can be literally
burned for energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most organisms organisms in the
presence of oxygen are using this
[SPEAKER_01]: literally plant carbon for energy and they
burn it for energy for energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this test does is use potassium
permanganate to mimic that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottom right, you see some tubes of
purple solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That purple solution is a potassium
permanganate indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that's mixed with the with the soil
sample, if there's a lot of material
[SPEAKER_01]: that's available to be burned as energy
for the organisms, that will tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach out more or less of that purple
color, which we then read in the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: left there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this picture, you see a little
colorimeter that with a cuvette that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can then read just how just how purple or
un-purple or how clear that solution is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a it's a very nice way to it's
an indicator to kind of give us an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a lot of fuel here for the
organisms or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the the very dead humic
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is we're learning more and more
about humic compounds, and they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: that that black box of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the those kind of long-legged,
long-chained complex organomolecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of resist breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stick around for a long time and
they're they're related to these black
[SPEAKER_01]: soils or biochar that we hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these just very complex materials
that are not active in the soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, but they certainly support those
sort of functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And humus, I show a picture on the bottom
left, how humus, like clay, can hold a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of cations, which is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it acts as a sponge to hold water,
which is really important on sandy soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but clay soil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned before how because this these
humic materials are very light,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes a clay soil, which is which tends
to get heavy and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps keep it loose and more open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I show some earthworm casts here on
the bottom right as well that contain some
[SPEAKER_01]: very complex, as these are analyzed,
some very complex molecules, slimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, but but other things beyond
beyond simple slimes that really help to
[SPEAKER_01]: bind these particles together and give the
soil that that structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, back to our our picture showing the
effect of adding organic matter on these
[SPEAKER_01]: different soil processes, ultimately
leading to healthy plants at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here I've put in some red boxes,
which are our soil health tests that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I like this slide so much is
it shows the kind of the strategy of an
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology of an interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet what we tried to do then is target
each of these processes, these functions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with a indicator test so we can see
just just how well these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: behaving, just what sort of levels of each
of these different features are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, then I put it here into a
kind of a table where on the right,
[SPEAKER_01]: my right here, I've listed the soil
processes that are associated with each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these then measured indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: This aggregate stability that was that
soil structural test with the raindrops
[SPEAKER_01]: and where we show the soil and the sieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an indicator for our then our
level of aeration in the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: infiltration, rooting effects,
erosion potential, grusting potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: our available water capacity indicator is
really giving us, again, information on
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil process of water retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to use this to kind of
understand then when we get the results of
[SPEAKER_01]: these measured indicators, what soil
processes that are good or bad or
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these processes are the things that
interact between these different physical,
[SPEAKER_01]: biological, and chemical arenas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet we break them out as separate
indicators and processes, but we still
[SPEAKER_01]: want to, again, put them back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is the product of this testing
then is our soil health test report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here's our indicators, which we
just saw on the table, the physical,
[SPEAKER_01]: biological, chemical, and where the blue
arrow is here, those are the values
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next column shows a rating where
we see kind of how we then interpret the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a red, a yellow, there we go,
a red, a yellow, and a green to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us are we low, medium, or high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of the values that come up in the
low range, we then immediately generate
[SPEAKER_01]: these constrained soil processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think why we're doing this test,
we really want to know what in the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: not functioning up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than tell a person,
no, your aggregate stability is low,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we really want to say is there's
these sort of processes that are impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what might you do, as I say,
part two, what you do to increase those or
[SPEAKER_01]: manage to alleviate those if we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you next where we get
these ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we use is a scoring function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that is, this is really just the
normal curve, the data distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at just one of these curves,
this clayey line with these little
[SPEAKER_01]: triangles, we follow that from low to
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the data in our database on
clayey soils for active carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've split it up into the lower 30%
of values in our database.
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle 40% of values in our database
and the upper 30% of values in our
[SPEAKER_01]: database.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a score, if you have a clay
soil and you have a score of here,
[SPEAKER_01]: 550, and you're a clay, we would say,
ah, you're in the lower 30% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would return a red score and say
your active carbon in this sample level
[SPEAKER_01]: would cause certain processes to be
impaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we move up and that was a sandy soil
and we got that same value, we would be in
[SPEAKER_01]: more intermediate range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, we see higher values in
the clay than in the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how we compensate for that by
splitting the samples into different
[SPEAKER_01]: textural classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this was developed under
vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we believe that this sort of ranking
and these sort of values are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: idealized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly vegetable crops and field crops
are trying to grow them at a fairly rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: speed like any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are good target values if we
really want to do some discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more interpretation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems obvious, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, this test has been around
since 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it measures, here's the 15 indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: This entire suite of tests here is $75,
keeping in mind that the chemical test at
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom here is 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's included.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also developed this basic soil
health test, which takes out two of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rather expensive biological tests,
which may not be germane to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, particularly dairy growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took out the potentially mineralizable
nitrogen and that root health bioassay,
[SPEAKER_01]: the root health rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able to cut the costs and
provide a product that may be more useful
[SPEAKER_01]: for landscapers or people that want to
test the soil health of their lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under development are ever more of these
tests as we get a larger database and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to, even in the next year,
release an urban soil health test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll hear more about these options
from Harold Van Ness on, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: March 9th, 2012 in this same seminar
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I didn't mention with the soil
chemical test here, we rank the results of
[SPEAKER_01]: this model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modified Morgan extraction, but New York
growers also receive the standard nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations from Dairy One,
Agro One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a plug for our website where
we have all the submission forms,
[SPEAKER_01]: background info, shipping information.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what you see here today is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our soil health assessment training
manual, just a tremendous resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very colorful and easy to read and
really lays out a lot of these ideas in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very straightforward way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's available for free,
downloadable as a PDF, even chapter by
[SPEAKER_01]: chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so sampling strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of hinted on this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sample the top six inches of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we would move across a,
let's call this a uniform field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could see where we might move in this
W pattern, where I have these round
[SPEAKER_01]: circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling that my five gallon pail,
where I put my subsample of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see the two stars,
that's where I'd take two penetrometer
[SPEAKER_01]: readings, where I'd push through from zero
to 18 inches and record at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: my submission form here, the 10 different
spots, my maximum value of the zero to six
[SPEAKER_01]: inch, maximum value from six to 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I move across the field then,
we get finally a sample from these five,
[SPEAKER_01]: we composite a sample out of these five
subsamples of soil and collect the 10
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrometer readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recommend doing this in the spring,
when the soil is at field capacity or the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall, when the soil is also rather damp in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the soil getting very hard and dry,
which tends to bias our soil penetrometer
[SPEAKER_01]: readings to the point where they're really
not useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more about sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really can't say enough about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get the results from what you put
in the sample bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I often stress with students when
we talk about sampling, is that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a question in mind that you want
to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me start here with a field that has
some nice representative plants growing
[SPEAKER_01]: here, then here's a problem area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we'd recommend here is to
sample this representative area and then
[SPEAKER_01]: collect it as sample one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sample two, we'd take a composite
sample from this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we can contrast them,
we can learn just what's going on in these
[SPEAKER_01]: two different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if we took an old fashioned
strategy might be to take most of my
[SPEAKER_01]: subsamples from the representative area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since my problem area is one-tenth of
the field, I'll put one-tenth of the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: in my bucket from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that will give me a grand average of
the field, because if this area is 10%,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's really not useful towards
understanding and managing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always like to stress that,
again, have a question in mind when you
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, area two, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Area one, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd want two, obviously, separate
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can apply this sort of thinking to
different soil types or management
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that we're trying, where plants
are growing good and not so good in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This test, remember, it's a real shotgun
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of information, and we can
just find out just kind of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: different between these two areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very educational to get all
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to mention this benchmark
sampling, where we would sample just off
[SPEAKER_01]: the field area to kind of see,
again, part of the understanding of our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to see just where our field stands
compared to the native capacity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here I'm going to return to this
14-year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 14 years into our long-term
tillage study up in northern New York in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lake Champlain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the results of 14 years of
plowing in the corn residue and planting
[SPEAKER_01]: corn again in the spring or going no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see here is a very different
looking soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recall they're both Kingsbury clay loam.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are replicated plots, but you can
see it's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's just see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, to me, this is just so
telling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would guess that we'd have some looking
at the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some physical impair impediments
to function compared to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can not only confirm that,
but we can put values on it so that as we
[SPEAKER_01]: modify our management, we can track that,
or we can see just how bad it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the most important thing is
I've circled in pink here these
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this soil on the left is suffering
from, it's got these constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these issues here are kind of
listed, these processes that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lower 30% of the database for clays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when I look at my management
potentials, I can try to kill multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: birds with my management stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the idea here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, in a research setting,
this is also very useful to get all this
[SPEAKER_01]: information to bring to bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly here, too, the steady diet
of 14 years of corn stover has left us
[SPEAKER_01]: with a, while this is a rather good
looking dark soil with good organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, it's kind of one dimensional.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food value is very high for the
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pointed out here, this low act
of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this soil would, we could see then that
even though overall it tests high when we
[SPEAKER_01]: look at all these indicators together
versus low for the soil, we could still
[SPEAKER_01]: modify our management to try to do
something to get some more food for the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, for the soil food web here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is a long-term research
experiment, which we were studying
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage, but it also allows us to kind of
dissect and say, what are some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of tillage?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I mentioned at the bottom of
these reports, it shows the percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, salt, clay, and then the soil
textural class.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil health testing, again,
it's a nice strategy to get at the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: physical, biologic, and chemical
processes, giving us some quantitative,
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive quantitative values on these
individual processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note also that there's, we don't give a
direct recommendation from this test,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just give the values.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real, besides education and
monitoring the effects of our management,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we want to be able to then target
our management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the real goal of this
testing, isn't to produce a pretty piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of paper or even to get a high score per
se, it's to find out what we need to do or
[SPEAKER_01]: what we can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should also mention too that certainly
this low scores or red marks on this test
[SPEAKER_01]: is not an indictment on any growers'
abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply that the process is below what
it, from our database, what it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would, that suggests then that
management to address that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of puts it all together here
across, what we've been doing now is
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about soil processes and in the
context of the soil health test
[SPEAKER_01]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a grower then with this report,
follow all this information, listing these
[SPEAKER_01]: constrained soil processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he or she is wondering, what am I
going to do with this information?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we mean by the holistic soil
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just about to move into adaptive
management, but this holistic idea is
[SPEAKER_01]: these same processes that we understood to
understand these test indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to use those processes
when we think about our management,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we want to, if those processes are
constrained, we need to know how
[SPEAKER_01]: management affects these processes so we
can bring them, so we can raise their
[SPEAKER_01]: values or move those values in the
appropriate direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our manual, what I show here is this,
this is actually table five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives just a broad sense table of short
and long term management approaches to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with, to deal with these different
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had a low aggregate stability in
the short term in vegetables, we'd suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: adding some sort of fresh organic
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a green manure, cover crop
or rotation crop, can actually be animal
[SPEAKER_01]: manure, grass clippings, who knows,
but the short term.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the long term, to deal with poor soil
structure values, we might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider looking at our tillage,
amounts of tillage, perhaps getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: surface mulch or sod crop into the
rotation, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a, this is a first cut
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not a recommendations table
per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collection of ideas and
opportunities that we want to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_01]: then when we think about what ultimately
we would do, what we want to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower come up with or what plan works for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are just kind of, as I say,
agronomic ideas of how things work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to have these in our mind as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, as agricultural
professionals, these are just the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we can hash out with a grower
to find the best result for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show how we do that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put together, this is also in the
manual, this field management sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's four steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a winning approach to
identifying problems in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find out what constraints, we look at
the report here and see what's constrained
[SPEAKER_01]: in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We list, well, what might we do about
those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these are all just discussion
topics, but they're important steps that
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to walk through so that we think,
okay, what might I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What might, right, I do about aggregate
stability, the shorter long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we could go straight to that
table for information, but more than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's local experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: People attend workshops, they hear of new
ideas at a trade show, online,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of put those ideas in here,
and then step three, we have to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the situational opportunities,
the grower we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is a unique individual,
their field is unique, their desires are
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person may have a lot of labor,
they may be young, they may be older,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may have money to invest,
may not, may want to be organic or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this has to enter into the equation
towards this goal, this final goal here of
[SPEAKER_01]: adapting these management, these options
to the grower, the capacity and needs of
[SPEAKER_01]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, what we're after here is a very,
is not just satisfactory, but satisfying
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of strategy for the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an iterative process going
back and forth, talking about what might
[SPEAKER_01]: be done singly or in combination to deal
with some of these constraints,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's available to the grower to deal
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they can or won't do, that's
important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, this is really the goal
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this management strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the condensate of
all this testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so for annual crops,
obviously it's different than non-annual
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got semi-permanent beds here,
or several year beds, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: in strawberries, this could last a couple
of years, or here's our grape example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these grapes could be here for many
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have different options
in the broad acre versus these sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: bedded situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to keep those management
options in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have more and better options here,
because we can bring in heavier
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and focused applications
right where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then between the plants, we don't have
to dilute our application.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can focus our applications,
I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that as consultants and
educators and growers, we want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about the latest ideas,
latest technologies, latest strategies,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can suggest or have a greater
repertoire of management options to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss with the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, we start with a broad
sense, and it's not a recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we say on a case-by-case,
field-by-field, grower-by-grower basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: what might we come up with for a plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every field and grower combination
is different, yet to be of greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: utility, I think this is the way forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so the kind of a synopsis slide
here, this adaptive management strategy is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, to me, the successful soil
management strategy made of these main
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to assess our soil's health to
identify constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just, again, I did want to
say that this isn't a sales pitch for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell Soil Health Test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we use to develop
these ideas and get them across,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's this stepwise approach to
understanding and then using that
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding to move forward with a
practical, logical management approach
[SPEAKER_01]: that ultimately is the most useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first we want to, again, get the
information, assess the soil's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we want to make changes that work for
that firm to address those specific
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we always recommend starting small
and experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any good grower is always doing this,
trying something, borrowing equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: renting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He or she hears about a new cover crop,
so they buy a bag of it and see how it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows on their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes white clover, you hear something
good about white clover and then you try
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow it and it just won't germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on another field, three hills over,
another grower, no white clover is a weed
[SPEAKER_01]: on that field and they can't get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where you want
to start small and just see what works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to adapt these many resources
of information to your farm, discussing
[SPEAKER_01]: with as many people as possible what's
going on with you, learning not just about
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil science, these underpinnings of
soil ecology, but you want to then know
[SPEAKER_01]: how these different processes are affected
by these new technologies, be it new
[SPEAKER_01]: gadgets, new varieties, what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately we're trying to build
our soil so that it has an increased
[SPEAKER_01]: resiliency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is the foundation to soil vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can reduce plant stresses with a
more vigorous soil, it will benefit with
[SPEAKER_01]: increased yield and less diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my last slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I would say thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess if there's questions that we
can move to Kathy as moderator and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: try to answer those one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Bob, for talking with us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question from Jeff Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know if there's a relationship
between gross organic matter as determined
[SPEAKER_00]: by ignition and active carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll like this one, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it turns out that organic matter loss
on ignition, that's the ultimate black
[SPEAKER_01]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's anything that will burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 650 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: You burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that's not mineral vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know the identity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if it's a complex humic
material, if it's fresh LFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alpha meal spread on the surface or alpha
clippings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while that's a useful number,
even tracking organic matter in time takes
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time to get big changes in that
number that you can say, oh, I'm moving in
[SPEAKER_01]: the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the active carbon,
because that focuses on this particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: important part of the soil organic matter,
again, this fuel, this delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritious high energy material,
if you will, the sugar and the candy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the candy and the quick food for
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a lot of that, we can guess our
soil's going to be robust and fast acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can then track if we're trying to
build ultimately our humic fraction or
[SPEAKER_01]: total organic matter amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives us a quicker indicator than in
just a couple of years, we can see those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels changing and say, ah, we are indeed
moving in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wait and see if we have any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next webinar is on Friday,
February 3rd from 2 to 315.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob will be back with us for that
webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to talk to us on how to
improve soil biological and physical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was your first time joining us,
please remember to download the pre-test
[SPEAKER_00]: and demographic survey, fill them out and
send them back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send them to my email,
MCM4 at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Jeff for coordinating
all aspects of the webinar today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was sorry he wasn't able to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get him a new headset and
he'll be back hosting next week,
[SPEAKER_00]: we hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jeff has another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there economical agents to apply to
soils to increase biological activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds like the magic bullet
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, certainly, anytime you add material
to the soil, you're going to affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil biological activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something certainly
organic growers are very aware of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, that's all we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to consider what we feed the soil
is what we'll get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we want to increase biological
activity, we want to increase the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we add a stimulant, of course,
we're just going to burn out our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe in the short term, one thing I
would say that would increase biological
[SPEAKER_01]: activity in a compost pile is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone knows this.
[SPEAKER_01]: While that will sure break down my compost
pile in a hurry, that may be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if I did that out in
the field, I may then have kind of burned
[SPEAKER_01]: off by doing that and adding nitrogen to a
surface organic layer, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will help decompose that organic
matter, but it's possibly too fast and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't take advantage of that breakdown
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where I think
you have to play it situation by
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do have a soil that's loaded
with organic material, but there's too
[SPEAKER_01]: much of it and you want to get rid of it,
then there are, for example, a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: application and a light tillage might be
just the thing to kind of stimulate that
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown and get this release you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to build that,
organic level, then you'd want to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that and find other ways and
just try a different approach than trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to just add some quick and dirty thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be a relay crop or a time delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often say that one of the most powerful
soil management tools we have is time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that apparently is
very, very dear to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, in strawberries,
often the strawberries are there for two
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe three years, but then they're
removed and something else is planted
[SPEAKER_01]: there for several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's in that then, that intermediate
period that this resting stage between the
[SPEAKER_01]: next strawberry crop that we can not only
want to return some sort of income,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we want to build the soil for the
strawberry, address measured or known
[SPEAKER_01]: issues or diseases, drainage, what have
you, so that when we get back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: berry, we've, as best we can, try to take
care of some of those constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if Jeff has another question
or we'll wait and see for another minute
[SPEAKER_00]: or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate everyone for joining us on this
snowy Friday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Jeff wants to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many vegetable growers use their entire
land base fence to fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you convince them to rotate to a
cover crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's just it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the point I was trying to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things you you have to
try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often it's a field day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so thankful for the granting agencies,
for example, New York Farm Viability
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute, that allow different growers to
basically giving them some funds to try
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just for the individual that's that's
hosting this experiment, but for others in
[SPEAKER_01]: that geographic area with a with a similar
soil, for example, seeing how how it kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of responds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the grower then says,
oh, my gosh, I've I can't believe how my
[SPEAKER_01]: my soil is so different after I use this
this cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a I don't want to say wake up
call, but it's very demonstrative then to
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else who is one wondering about
how that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can see it, maybe try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you're going to see more
and more growers finding ways to not go
[SPEAKER_01]: fence to fence with production rather than
being strung out and growing possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: lower, lower value crops, lower quality
crops to grow a little bit less acreage of
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building these soils that are resting,
then as these soils build, it's easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: get these better quality, higher value
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a it's kind of a syndrome
we're in, I think, where we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to get
the most out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with there's there's lots of
examples out there now where we while
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a strategy, there's a that may be a
little bit much of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could kind of merge that with
some of these organic resting techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: but soil building techniques, we may find
out some very useful strategies to build
[SPEAKER_01]: our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you comment on your quickly on your
file that you uploaded for us and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll close.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that file, I went to the Australian
wine industry technical conference back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we talked about there was,
of course, our soil health test being
[SPEAKER_01]: developed for vegetables and field crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a it's the strategy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that you're supposed to use this
test and everything will be everything
[SPEAKER_01]: will work out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's a strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to get information and then use
the information in the from this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process driven suite of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you want to manage those
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but in a different commodity,
for example, wine grapes, the these
[SPEAKER_01]: measured or measured ranges may be even
nonsensical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, it's it opens up the idea for
new research with experts in the field of
[SPEAKER_01]: the particular commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, in wine grapes or I
should say in field crops, we would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that in general, a higher value for
available water capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the soil can store more water,
that's better in general for field crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for wine grapes, that may not be the
case at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be even the opposite because we
want the stress of the water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, again, not our place is to to
address that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the the the work of folks in
that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for wine grapes, how do we address
available water capacity and then see that
[SPEAKER_01]: the strategies there but then this what I
call this transfer protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this I propose to use a similar
strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a good strategy, but you need
to adapt it and adopt it to your
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As as an expert, you can say, well,
no, it's that's not important for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it may be even a different indicator
that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a plant or you're in an area
that was very sensitive, very likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: have salt injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, you'd want to have some
sort of a test that would address that
[SPEAKER_01]: issue built right into your soil health
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do that because it's not an
issue with the crops we're dealing with in
[SPEAKER_01]: our test and in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, that's that's what this
paper talks about is it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a way to make sure you're not
adding eyes and crossing tees in whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: crop arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sure that you're covering
those bases so you can find out where
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're constrained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Bob and everyone for
participating and we'll see you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: third of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
