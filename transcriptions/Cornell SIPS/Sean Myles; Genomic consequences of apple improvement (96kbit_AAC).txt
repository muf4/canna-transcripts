[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And welcome everybody to the Fall 2020
seminar series online.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm particularly excited for our seminar
speaker to kick off with apples as we get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the apple harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today's seminar speaker is Sean Miles
from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first learned about Sean from his
research in apple genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was working on the
horticultural side, he's been working a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot on the genetic side and we have a lot
of overlapping interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really became apparent in our
conversation just before this seminar
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in doing a little bit of research on
Sean, it's pretty interesting and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always really fascinating to learn about
people's academic histories and really
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's training was in human genetics and
he was studying the populations of
[SPEAKER_01]: different people around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was working at the Max Planck Institute
in Germany and actually was working on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the earliest sequencing,
fast sequencing machines and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: process through many samples and doing
things like SNP arrays for humans to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how different populations and
people moved around the world and then got
[SPEAKER_01]: into grapes basically because he fell in
love with a winemaker and figured that if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to find a place to live
together, he better figure out something
[SPEAKER_01]: that he can do where she's going to be
based because grapes can only be grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: so many locations throughout the world and
got into apples later in his academic
[SPEAKER_01]: interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really fascinating and deep research
history that Sean has.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we do for all of our seminar speakers,
one interesting fact, and even though all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these things I mentioned already were
quite interesting, I asked Sean if there
[SPEAKER_01]: was something he'd like to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the interesting and not well known
fact about Sean Miles is that he can tap
[SPEAKER_01]: dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can think about him tap dancing
while he does his seminar today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pass it off to Sean at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if anybody has questions for Sean
during the seminar, feel free to put them
[SPEAKER_01]: in the chat and we'll address them during
the Q&A period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thanks, Greg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, if anyone has any problems
hearing me, then they can put something
[SPEAKER_05]: into the chat there to let them know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking, you know what,
it actually would make the seminar a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: more interesting if I was tap dancing
while doing a talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would need a little more practice,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really quite plan on that,
but I'll keep it in mind for next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll expect another invitation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to mention too, I'm gonna
share my screen here, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is how this works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that if I pop this up, I believe
everybody should be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did wanna mention, you know,
you talked about this sort of circuitous
[SPEAKER_05]: route towards agriculture and it's worth,
since there are many students listening
[SPEAKER_05]: in, I hope that, you know, often it's a
little bit daunting when showing up
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere and getting into something new
and when you're getting into a new subject
[SPEAKER_05]: area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanna assure you, you know,
I did my undergraduate degree with a major
[SPEAKER_05]: in English literature and my master's and
PhD in human genetics and didn't start
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at plants until my postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, these sorts of
circuitous routes can happen in life and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's lots of chance meetings along the
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you put your head down and focus on
doing good science and doing good work,
[SPEAKER_05]: then lots of things are possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I thought I'd mention that because
I know that often, in fact, every time I
[SPEAKER_05]: took a new position somewhere at each
institution that I went to, I would feel
[SPEAKER_05]: completely overwhelmed when I first got
there, like I did during my postdoc at
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I arrived in Ed Buckler's lab who was
talking a million miles a minute about
[SPEAKER_05]: corn and I knew nothing about anything
anyone was talking about in lab meetings
[SPEAKER_05]: as a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you kind of feel like you might,
you should probably know something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that feeling of being overwhelmed and
being stressed out and like feeling like
[SPEAKER_05]: you're an imposter and you're in the wrong
place, I can assure you that it does
[SPEAKER_05]: subside with the years and that's my
little piece of advice for all the
[SPEAKER_05]: students getting in and shuffling around
into their different departments and
[SPEAKER_05]: different endeavors along their career
paths.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing I'd like to start with is
that to show you where I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm in Nova Scotia, Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up here in the sort of northeast of the
North American continent, out on that
[SPEAKER_05]: little peninsula, and it's a beautiful
place to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought I'd just describe a little
bit where I am here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing of the US on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maine is just the west of New Brunswick
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are in, I'm located in the
Annapolis Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for Dalhousie University,
but I actually work out of a federal
[SPEAKER_05]: research station.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like Cornell professors
who are co-located up in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually work out of a federal research
station here in Kentville, Nova Scotia,
[SPEAKER_05]: up here in what we call the Annapolis
Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Annapolis Valley contains about,
we grow about 10% of Canada's apple
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very small area, but it's
sizable in terms of its contribution to
[SPEAKER_05]: apples in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's only about a million people
who live in Nova Scotia overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's mostly rural.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main city is Halifax.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow in our little valley here,
grow almost the majority of the food grown
[SPEAKER_05]: in Nova Scotia, especially all the fruit
crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grow apples and pears and plums and
peaches and more and more grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a growing wine industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not unlike upstate New York in its
growing conditions and the sorts of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a beautiful place to visit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when all this COVID stuff is over,
you're more than welcome to come and have
[SPEAKER_05]: a glance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't often get visitors coming up to
talk about science.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a real pleasure if you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were ever thinking of having a
visit up to the East coast of Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: please do get in touch and I'd be happy to
show you around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a beautiful place to come and eat
apples and drink cider too, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did want to mention, during my
postdoc, when I was at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was a real interest in using modern
genomics technology and the emerging
[SPEAKER_05]: genomics technologies to characterize the
USDA's gene banks or germplasm collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my postdoc project under the
supervision of Ed Buckler was to
[SPEAKER_05]: characterize, develop a SNP array and
characterize the USDA grape germplasm
[SPEAKER_05]: collection in collaboration with the USDA
researchers up in Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also part of the collection is down in
Davis, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a wonderful opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt really fortunate to be able to do
that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've moved on now, started a position
up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our experience dealing with the
USDA germplasm collection, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that it was not planted for the
purposes of doing genetic mapping work
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's planted as a gene bank in order to
preserve and maintain diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that often means that the
plants are planted at different times,
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps on different root stocks,
maintained by different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the data is collected at different
times of the year and in a different way
[SPEAKER_05]: than you would expect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to collect the data for the
purposes of genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I started my position here in
Canada, I made a special request to the
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA that was accepted, fortunately,
to actually make a copy essentially of the
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA apple germplasm collection up in Nova
Scotia, which we now call Canada's Apple
[SPEAKER_05]: Biodiversity Collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: It contains as many of the malus
domestica, so the domesticated apple and
[SPEAKER_05]: its primary wild ancestor, malus subruta,
malus percii.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we didn't take all the other wild
species and incorporate it in here,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the purpose of this population was
really to plant it out specifically for
[SPEAKER_05]: the purposes of genetic mapping and doing
genome-wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we planted this out, each of these
varieties out in duplicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we grafted them all to M9 root stock
in 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 2013, we planted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we ended up with 1,113 different
accessions planted in duplicate with check
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties that are planted throughout so
that you can control for the spatial
[SPEAKER_05]: effects in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in total, it's 2,354 trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that includes most of that material is
from the USDA, but there's also advanced
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding lines from Canada's apple
breeding program and some other stuff we
[SPEAKER_05]: had hanging around in Nova Scotia that we
threw in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're ever interested in seeing
this, what we've been doing to give you an
[SPEAKER_05]: idea, I'm not going to talk about this
collection today.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really the genetic mapping work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk more about the
evolutionary work that we've done based on
[SPEAKER_05]: the USDA collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we've really focused on here in
Nova Scotia with this apple biodiversity
[SPEAKER_05]: collection is to try to get as much
phenotype data as we can on a budget,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very time consuming and expensive
to do, as many of you are aware,
[SPEAKER_05]: to collect traits across an orchard like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've made use of barcode scanners
where we can to speed that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a Herculean effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really to do over a thousand varieties and
harvest them all at the right times,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, because they're all developing at
different rates and put them through,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and collect the data that you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made a little video here and I'm
hoping this is going to work and we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is one of the devices we use
called the Pimpernel that does automated
[SPEAKER_05]: weighing of every apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the so the first step is the
weight weighing right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next step, it goes up into a
penetrometer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an automated penetrometer that
will take a firmness measure and it shoots
[SPEAKER_05]: that apple into a chute that then gets
squished and the apple gets squished up
[SPEAKER_05]: and it does automatically.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes the acidity and the soluble
solids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you get that automatically directly
into the spreadsheet, no writing down data
[SPEAKER_05]: and copying it back into Excel files and
so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we made that trying to find ways of
making that data acquisition process as
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the other little devices is
pretty nifty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we want to get color and shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take a picture of all the apples going
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: You call this little device the Snapple
because it takes snapshots of every apple
[SPEAKER_05]: and you go and put the apple in and it
takes a snapshot and links it to the ID
[SPEAKER_05]: and it goes right up into a little drive
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put this together with some engineering
students at the university.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that sped things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've we've got a decent data set from
our Apple biodiversity question,
[SPEAKER_05]: since many of those are actually apples
that are found at the USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collection in Geneva that the data set
that we will will come to publish here
[SPEAKER_05]: shortly will be, you know, it'll be
publicly available and available to anyone
[SPEAKER_05]: who's also studying these apples in
Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I encourage anybody who is doing work
in apples and is looking for sort of a
[SPEAKER_05]: comprehensive evaluation of phenotype data
that they might like to link to the data
[SPEAKER_05]: that they've got and the genotype data is
going to be all available as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've got about quarter million
markers now of genotypes in the entire
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were really keen to know of
other people who are doing this kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: work on those same varieties and since
they're genetically identical,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just planted in different spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're up in the Geneva collection
doing something interesting, then feel
[SPEAKER_05]: free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to come up with a way of
helping out your study and perhaps adding
[SPEAKER_05]: some data to it that will be useful to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so today I'm going to talk about some
data that we've collected on the USDA
[SPEAKER_05]: collection, which is far overdue to be
published, but it should come out
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is work that was led by two postdocs
in my lab, Zoe Mijakovski and Kyle
[SPEAKER_05]: Gardner, and some help from a PhD student,
Sophie Watts, and my main collaborator,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jun Song from Agriculture and Agri-food
Canada here, who helped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a project that was led in
collaboration with the USDA, led by Ganyan
[SPEAKER_05]: Song in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the USDA apple germplasm collection is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a real showcase gene bank from
the USDA in terms of its breadth and
[SPEAKER_05]: depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, the number of countries
represented in terms of where these apples
[SPEAKER_05]: are coming from is enormous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a lot of them are from the
United States, 228, but there's 100
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties from the United Kingdom and a
good representation from Central Asia,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is sort of the original home of the
apples or where it originated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those progenitor apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this gives you an idea of the
breadth of that collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we did is we collected genotyping
by sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk about some genetic data
that we collected from this entire
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ran 42 lanes of Illumina high-seq,
so generated 7.8 to 7.9 billion hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: base pair reads from 1,949 accessions from
that collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna talk today about what we did
with the other members of the malice
[SPEAKER_05]: species that have not really contributed
or contributed only recently really to
[SPEAKER_05]: apple breeding and apple development to
modern cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm focusing mainly today, exclusively
today on the variety, on the species
[SPEAKER_05]: thought to have contributed to modern day
apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've used these data already actually
in a previous publication to do a genome
[SPEAKER_05]: wide association study to perform some
genetic mapping where we take the data
[SPEAKER_05]: from USDA GRIN database and so we didn't
collect any phenotype data ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just used existing historical phenotype
data from the database and linked it to
[SPEAKER_05]: the GBS data, the genotyping by sequencing
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that resulted in about at that time
when we were doing fairly simple
[SPEAKER_05]: bioinformatics with these data,
we had 8,000 SNPs or single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_05]: polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the markers that we get from the
sequence data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we only ended up with 8,000 SNPs and
some very messy phenotype data I must
[SPEAKER_05]: admit from the USDA GRIN database.
[SPEAKER_05]: Often things are scored as the apple is
either soft or it's hard, but not a
[SPEAKER_05]: quantification of the actual firmness of
the apple for instance, or the apple is
[SPEAKER_05]: either early or it's late, but not the
actual date it was harvested on and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But despite that, even with some
relatively noisy phenotype data,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can catch the lowest hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did in that publication demonstrate
that we identified the main locus
[SPEAKER_05]: underlying firmness that we've done some
subsequent work on and believe that it is
[SPEAKER_05]: very important for ripening, apple
ripening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to talk about that work
today, but I do want to point out that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's really great using these genotyping
by sequencing data or any of this next
[SPEAKER_05]: generation DNA sequence data compared to
microarrays.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're using a microarray,
you run it once and the data you've got is
[SPEAKER_05]: what you've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it turns out with sequence data,
there's always a new algorithm coming out
[SPEAKER_05]: every year to be able to point at your
original sequence data to extract more of
[SPEAKER_05]: that data.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent a couple of years developing
imputation algorithms and genotype calling
[SPEAKER_05]: algorithms that would be more suitable for
non-model organisms like the apple that
[SPEAKER_05]: have relatively poor reference genome
where the order of the markers is not
[SPEAKER_05]: always really reliable, where you can't
really phase apple types because of rapid
[SPEAKER_05]: linkage equilibrium decay and where the
existing genome sequences are kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: poor quality and they're highly,
highly heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those present some challenges for
genotype calling and generating a really
[SPEAKER_05]: good genetic data set.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we worked quite hard on this and
developed our most recent imputation
[SPEAKER_05]: algorithm link computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with link computer, we've actually
managed to generate a lot more SNPs in the
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation that I'm doing today and the
paper that we've got submitted,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got about 20 to 30,000 SNPs so you
more than double the number of SNPs you
[SPEAKER_05]: got from your first try.
[SPEAKER_05]: But since then, we've actually tweaked
things a little bit and we're up over
[SPEAKER_05]: 200,000 SNPs now with the exact same data
that we used to only get 8,000 SNPs from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, with microarrays, you get what
you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the sequence data, there are ways
of using that missing data that's in
[SPEAKER_05]: there, using patterns from the existing
data to fill in missing data quite a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: better, we find.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been a real benefit to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just keep that in mind in that link
computer algorithm for people who are
[SPEAKER_05]: working on non-model organisms and
collecting genetic data and they wish to
[SPEAKER_05]: fill in their missing data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Link computer is great because it allows
you to say, for example, I'm okay with a
[SPEAKER_05]: 10% genotyping error rate if I can get a
quarter million SNPs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can say, no, no, no, I want really
high quality, I only want 1% error rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you might only get 25,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it allows the user to decide what
error rate they wish to accept and
[SPEAKER_05]: therefore how many markers you're willing
to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're on a fishing expedition and
you're doing some genetic mapping,
[SPEAKER_05]: you may wanna make it pretty loose and
have large numbers of markers with quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of error.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuz you can always go back to the markers
that are associated and go check to see
[SPEAKER_05]: whether they're real.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, if you're doing some
kind of population genetic analysis and
[SPEAKER_05]: you want reliable marker data,
you may wanna be more strict.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it allows the user to decide that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'm just gonna get into some of
the questions that we wish to answer with
[SPEAKER_05]: these genetic data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's well known from several
publications and from lots of work that's
[SPEAKER_05]: even been done on the phenotype level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just traditional botany that the
primary progenitor of the modern apple
[SPEAKER_05]: that you would see in the grocery store is
comes from a species called malice aversi,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is still found in the forests of
Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan Mountains
[SPEAKER_05]: along the very close to the border of
China.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here you see malice aversi here
printed in right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_05]: Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's believed that this malice aversi
then as humans moved along with humans
[SPEAKER_05]: over to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there it had some integration from
malice silvestris, which is another malice
[SPEAKER_05]: species.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a wild European crab apple,
very small, astringent and bitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the degree of that integration is
still under debate and there's been some
[SPEAKER_05]: conflicting findings in the literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things that we can do with
our data, since we have some malice
[SPEAKER_05]: silvestris in the collection and some
malice aversi and lots of modern apples,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can ask ourselves the question of what
do the relationships look like between
[SPEAKER_05]: these various species?
[SPEAKER_05]: So here are the sample sizes across the
top for this particular analysis of 749
[SPEAKER_05]: malice domestica.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the, what you would consider
dessert apples and cider apples,
[SPEAKER_05]: modern varieties and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: 115 malice aversi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are from Kazakhstan and 11 malice
silvestris from Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see if we run a principal
components analysis, if we take those 20
[SPEAKER_05]: to 30,000 SNPs and we plug them into
principal components, what principal
[SPEAKER_05]: components allows us to do is visualize
the relationships among all the
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals in two dimensions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have 20 to 30,000 SNPs and you want to
visualize how everyone is related.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially PC1 here is like shooting a
regression line through a 20 to 30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then PC2 is then another orthogonal
kind of regression line through that
[SPEAKER_05]: space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's capturing as much of the
variation in the data as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see PC1 accounts for about
6.5% of the data, 6.74% of the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're looking at here,
it gives you a visualization of the
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships among individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you see the squares on the
right-hand side of the plot, those are all
[SPEAKER_05]: malice silvestris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the European wild crab apple on
the right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that there's two groups of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the one in the top,
they're from Germany and the one down
[SPEAKER_05]: below are from further in Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of structure
within the population, but we're really
[SPEAKER_05]: just concerned with PC1 here and how very
easily the genetic data separate those
[SPEAKER_05]: malice silvestris samples represented by
the squares on the right with the
[SPEAKER_05]: triangles on the left-hand side,
which belong to malice aversi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very easy with these genetic data
to pull these two species apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we want to know where the malice
domestica lie and how they're related to
[SPEAKER_05]: these two groups, then what we do is we
project those malice domestica onto these
[SPEAKER_05]: axes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a way of doing this using
standard principal components analysis to
[SPEAKER_05]: project those samples on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've colored those dots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either they're gray if we don't know
exactly what they're used for,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if they're cider apples, they're in
orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're dessert, mainly what we
call dessert apples or the ones,
[SPEAKER_05]: the eating apples, the ones you find in
the grocery store, or others, some of them
[SPEAKER_05]: are labeled as cooking in Grin,
but they're essentially not cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that basically you form a
cloud right in the middle, right between
[SPEAKER_05]: malice aversi and sylvestris, about 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the conclusion there would be that they
share about half their ancestry from the
[SPEAKER_05]: original ancestor malice aversi and about
half malice sylvestris.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'd be cautious about putting too
much into that interpretation,
[SPEAKER_05]: given the number of markers we have and
the number of malice sylvestris samples we
[SPEAKER_05]: have, which is only 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some more studies coming out
that we know of here in the near future
[SPEAKER_05]: that are doing whole genome sequencing,
which we'll be able to better answer those
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But despite that, one of the most
interesting things here is that those two
[SPEAKER_05]: clouds of orange and blue dots don't
actually line up completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: The orange dots tend to be pulled over
further to the right and the blue dots
[SPEAKER_05]: further to the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's demonstrated here in panel B,
where if you look at the PC1 values of
[SPEAKER_05]: cider apples, you can see that they are
significantly greater than the PC1 values
[SPEAKER_05]: of the other dessert apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it appears from our analysis that
regardless of what the proportions are of
[SPEAKER_05]: the ancestry between sylvestris and
aversi, that cider apples tend to,
[SPEAKER_05]: they appear to derive more of their
ancestry from malice sylvestris,
[SPEAKER_05]: the European crab apple, than do dessert
apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this makes good sense in a way because
the malice sylvestris apple are known to
[SPEAKER_05]: be very astringent and bitter and have a
lot of tannin and are acidic and share
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those characteristics that cider
apples, that are desirable in cider apples
[SPEAKER_05]: and that are less desirable in an eating
apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it may be the case that some of
those desirable characteristics from cider
[SPEAKER_05]: apples are actually introgression events
from malice sylvestris.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't able really to do a piece by
piece genome analysis to see where those
[SPEAKER_05]: introgressions might occur given the snip
density that we have, but I'm sure that's
[SPEAKER_05]: coming in the future too with future data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question we can ask is what
regions of the genome appear to have been
[SPEAKER_05]: under selection during domestication?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are the regions of the genome that
really are most differentiated between
[SPEAKER_05]: malice domestica or the apples that you
might see on the grocery store shelf
[SPEAKER_05]: versus the wild ancestors that are growing
in the forests of Kazakhstan?
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do this, what you can do is
calculate FST, which is a measure of
[SPEAKER_05]: allele frequency difference between the
two populations, between malice domestica
[SPEAKER_05]: and malice aversii.
[SPEAKER_05]: And FST is a very simple measure.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the allele frequency at a particular
snip is exactly the same between the two
[SPEAKER_05]: populations, you get an FST of zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a fixed difference, if all the
domestica are homozygous AA at that locus
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the malice aversii are homozygous
TT for the other allele, then that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: fixed difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they'd have an FST of one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that there are regions of the
genome that are approaching an FST of one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of the dots on this plot represents
one of the snips that we've genotyped.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the horizontal red line represents the
5% threshold genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any dots above that line are within the
top 5% most extreme FST values in the
[SPEAKER_05]: genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we expect when selection happens
at a particular locus is the markers
[SPEAKER_05]: there, they'll be driven to high frequency
very, very quickly over time, and there'll
[SPEAKER_05]: be a large FST value between domestica and
aversii.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're taking a look at all those dots
across the top and thinking, OK,
[SPEAKER_05]: are those lying in any genes that are
particularly important?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a somewhat orthogonal
analysis you can do here to determine
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's really selection or not,
because you can make an FST distribution
[SPEAKER_05]: from two populations when no selection has
happened, and there's still going to be 5%
[SPEAKER_05]: of your markers that are going to be
within the top 5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always a top 5% to every
distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we throw another analysis at this
called XPEHH.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when a marker rises in frequency very
quickly due to selection instead of just
[SPEAKER_05]: genetic drift, then what happens is
recombination doesn't have enough time to
[SPEAKER_05]: go and break down the haplotype that's
around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you end up with is a very long
haplotype that's homozygous in the
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can be calculated as this
statistic called cross-population extended
[SPEAKER_05]: haplotype homozygosity, or the XPEHH.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's shown there on the y-axis on
this bottom panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And each of the dots, again, here
represent one marker.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we've genotyped across the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And its position along that axis shows
whether it shows extended haplotype
[SPEAKER_05]: homozygosity in malus domestica.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we're checking to see,
look for evidence of selection within the
[SPEAKER_05]: domesticated apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dots that lie above that horizontal red
line represent potential targets of
[SPEAKER_05]: selection during domestication and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, ideally in these circumstances,
you see a great big peak that overlaps
[SPEAKER_05]: with FST and with XPEHH.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right underneath that peak,
you look into the genome browser and you
[SPEAKER_05]: see the name of a gene that is really
obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you go and you look at it in
detail and you characterize it in a tomato
[SPEAKER_05]: and you throw it at Nature Genetics and
you get published.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't turn out that way for us,
I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: With no smoking guns, I mean, you look at
the gene list and it's lots of different
[SPEAKER_05]: genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the things you can do when
you don't have any real great candidate
[SPEAKER_05]: genes for domestication between the
domesticated apple and its ancestor,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's worth keeping in mind that when we
look at the ancestor of the domesticated
[SPEAKER_05]: apple, they often really look the same
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they look very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Subversive eye apples sometimes look like
something you could find in the grocery
[SPEAKER_05]: store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in other animals and other plants,
when you look at the wild ancestor and you
[SPEAKER_05]: look at the modern cultivar, it's really
obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, okay, it's seed shattering
or it's ear development or it's something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in apple, it's really not entirely
evident what genes we would look at if we
[SPEAKER_05]: were gonna look at something that's been
under selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have really good a priori
ideas about what they should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things you can do,
you can take a look at all of the SNPs
[SPEAKER_05]: that overlap within the top 5% for both
FST and XPHH.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those represent potential targets of
selection and you can look at whether
[SPEAKER_05]: genes that are within a certain distance,
I think 50 kb we chose, and then you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see whether those genes are enriched in
any particular biological category,
[SPEAKER_05]: are they involved, are they enriched in
some function.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we do a gene ontology enrichment
analysis, we do find these three things
[SPEAKER_05]: that are enriched for these genes that
appear to have been, that show signatures
[SPEAKER_05]: of selection in malus domestica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's target of rapamycin signaling,
cellular response to phosphate starvation
[SPEAKER_05]: and cellular response to stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been suggested before too in a
previous publication that the targets of
[SPEAKER_05]: selection in the domesticated apple are
related to adaptation to new environments
[SPEAKER_05]: as they've moved from the Tien Shan
mountains to new environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our data are consistent with that
hypothesis, but we don't have any really
[SPEAKER_05]: great smoking guns and single genes that
we have a great story about right now in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of domestication in apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can do the exact same analysis
actually by comparing dessert apples to
[SPEAKER_05]: cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are 69 apples in the collection
for which we have genotype data and good
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype data that are characterized as
cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are, so in some cases are
characterized as both, these are the ones
[SPEAKER_05]: that are characterized as just cider
apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dessert apples, we have 288.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a comparison comparing FST between
dessert and cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the FST values are
generally lower, they don't go all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: up to one, the y-axis there is only going
up to 0.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're more closely related to each
other than malus domestica and malus
[SPEAKER_05]: aversiae, that makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we see here is that the same kind
of analysis can be done, but in this case,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can look at genes that appear to have
been under selection, according to this
[SPEAKER_05]: XBHH statistic in dessert apples,
those would be found above the dotted red
[SPEAKER_05]: line here in below.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those that appear to carry a
signature of selection in cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what may have been selected for in
cider apple development and cider
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cider apple breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we don't find any single genes
that stand out as being the sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking gun in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we do a gene ontology enrichment
analysis, we do find that flavonoid
[SPEAKER_05]: biosynthesis genes are enriched in the
regions of high FST and high XBHH in the
[SPEAKER_05]: dessert apples, while malate transport is
enriched for cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that cider apples in general are
more acidic and malate transport genes are
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in the production of malic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very possible that this is
something that's been selected for in
[SPEAKER_05]: cider apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And flavonoid biosynthesis, flavonoids are
molecules that contribute to the tannin
[SPEAKER_05]: and the mouth feel and the polyphenols in
an apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the, Greg can help me on all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he knows a lot more about this
than I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the flavonoid biosynthesis in dessert
apples, one might think, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, in terms of the difference
between dessert and cider apples,
[SPEAKER_05]: dessert apples probably have fewer
polyphenols than cider apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it may be exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be that there's been active
selection against polyphenols and
[SPEAKER_05]: antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, we have some orthogonal data
here to speak to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the phenolic content in apple
varieties compared to their year of
[SPEAKER_05]: release.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all dessert apples that have
a year of release associated with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that it's the only thing
we've found actually that's correlated
[SPEAKER_05]: with year of release.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've looked at soluble solids and size
and acids and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only thing that seems to be really
robustly correlated with year of release,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the year that the apple cultivar
was released to the public after breeding,
[SPEAKER_05]: is phenolic content seems to have gone
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that in the year 2000,
the average for apples that were released
[SPEAKER_05]: after the year 2000, their phenolic
content is on average I think something
[SPEAKER_05]: like 30% lower than things that were
released before 1900.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does suggest that perhaps there has
been active selection by breeders for
[SPEAKER_05]: reduced polyphenol content in dessert
apples, making them less astringent,
[SPEAKER_05]: less bitter, and less tannic, and that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is worthy of future investigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But undoubtedly, the strongest signature
of selection that we find in the genome is
[SPEAKER_05]: for color.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the top panel here, you see the
result of a GWAS for color with these
[SPEAKER_05]: data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in GWAS, we take a look at every marker
and it's the strength of its correlation
[SPEAKER_05]: with a trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, the apples are
characterized in the USDA GRIN database as
[SPEAKER_05]: either red or green, or red or not red,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've actually just done an
analysis here of red versus green apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we compare red versus green
apples and we calculate and we do a GWAS
[SPEAKER_05]: where we're looking for the correlation
between each marker and that color,
[SPEAKER_05]: the strength of the correlation is
indicated by the height of the dot on that
[SPEAKER_05]: y-axis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that y-axis is the minus log 10p value
of the strength of the association.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, that horizontal red line that
you see across here, that represents our
[SPEAKER_05]: significance threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dots that are above that, we're going
to consider significant in this analysis
[SPEAKER_05]: after correcting for multiple comparisons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that there's one very
strong peak here on chromosome nine,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's unsurprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: It overlaps with the red te, this
transposable element that we believe is
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for the red color in apples
that's been described in another
[SPEAKER_05]: manuscript here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sits in the middle of a MIB
transcription factor, which is known to be
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in anthocyanin synthesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're picking up the locus using GWAS.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some little helicopter,
what we call helicopter hits flying around
[SPEAKER_05]: here on the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turns out those actually are not other
loci involved in color, but they're
[SPEAKER_05]: mismaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually belong on chromosome nine,
but the genome is often wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you end up with these little dots
around the genome, and they're just in the
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really have one single locus,
a very strong major effect locus
[SPEAKER_05]: controlling color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we look at the XPHH again,
and we compare red to green apples,
[SPEAKER_05]: it turns out that red apples have a very
long extended haplotype around there,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're often homozygous for this
haplotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see this extended haplotype
homozygosity, this very strong signature
[SPEAKER_05]: of selection around that MIB locus,
suggesting that breeders over the last,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can't really say how many years,
but certainly over the last several
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred years have been selecting for
redder and redder apples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do similarly, you can think of
other phenotypes that may have been
[SPEAKER_05]: desirable during apple improvement,
and that may have been targeted,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that we may be able to find signatures
for in the genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those might be firmness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here we're presenting just firmness at
harvest, and I understand firmness at
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest is one thing, but firmness after a
few months of storage is a completely
[SPEAKER_05]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how much do you soften?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not looking at softening here,
I'm really just looking at firmness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so firmness at harvest, if you run
this in the USDA GRIN database,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's characterized as either firm or soft.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take those two, and we run a GWAS
with our markers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is with 8,000 markers in a previous
publication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we find this, again, this is each
marker and its strength of its
[SPEAKER_05]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The higher on the y-axis, the stronger the
correlation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the dotted line here is the
significance threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we find this one hit on chromosome
three, and it falls within NAC 18.1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And NAC is a transcription factor that's
known to be involved in the ripening
[SPEAKER_05]: process of lots of organisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, its homolog in tomato is the nor
gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the nor mutant in tomato is a
well-known mutant, which is a knockout of
[SPEAKER_05]: the nor gene that inhibits ripening in the
tomato.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in other organisms, we know that
NAC genes are involved in ripening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an excellent candidate gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of these cases where we did
have a smoking gun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do the analysis, we find the gene,
it looks like NAC 18.1.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many times it's been verified in other
collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly when we do it in our whole
Apple biodiversity collection with 863
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties, you can see that it comes out,
that same snip actually comes out as the
[SPEAKER_05]: top snip.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how much more power you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you measure firmness here using a
digital penetrometer and measure the
[SPEAKER_05]: actual firmness and get a quantitative
measure, and you have four times the
[SPEAKER_05]: sample size or twice the sample size
maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that NAC really comes out
very, very strong here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is, is there any signature of
selection around that locus?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any evidence that there's been
selection for firmness during Apple
[SPEAKER_05]: improvement?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question is, well, kind of maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the firm versus soft apples that we do
with our 20 to 30,000 snips in this
[SPEAKER_05]: particular paper that I'm presenting here
in this analysis, we see that NAC 18.1,
[SPEAKER_05]: that green dot again, that's the marker in
the middle of NAC 18.1.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it does not go above the line
and is not significant in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite the fact that we know now that
we've done this in other populations and
[SPEAKER_05]: the folks in Denmark did it, an analysis,
and they also found NAC 18.1 associated
[SPEAKER_05]: with is another European group has.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that that's really a snip that
should be associated significantly with
[SPEAKER_05]: firmness.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is a good lesson for people when
they're doing genetic mapping is like,
[SPEAKER_05]: where did that horizontal red line come
from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who decided that it was going to be there?
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact of the matter is, is in this
analysis, we have 20 to 30,000 snips.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we correct for multiple
comparisons, that red line goes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the criteria become more stringent.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have fewer markers, the red line
goes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if NAC 18.1 is part of the marker set,
in one analysis, it's significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You add markers to your analysis,
all of a sudden it's not significant
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't mean statistical
significance with these somewhat arbitrary
[SPEAKER_05]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very different from biological
significance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth keeping in mind that just
because NAC 18.1 falls below the
[SPEAKER_05]: horizontal line in this analysis doesn't
mean that it's not biologically relevant
[SPEAKER_05]: because we have evidence from other
studies that it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where does it fall in terms of its
significance?
[SPEAKER_05]: The signature of selection in terms of its
haplotype homozygosity, you can see here
[SPEAKER_05]: on the bottom panel, that green dot is the
snip that lies within NAC 18.1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is not within the top 5% of snips
genome-wide, but it's within the top 5.2%
[SPEAKER_05]: of snips genome-wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're in one of these situations
again, where it sits right around the
[SPEAKER_05]: threshold of significance that you've made
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the evidence is a little bit
ambivalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's worth pointing these things out
because sometimes you wish the analyses
[SPEAKER_05]: would come out and provide you smoking
guns every time, but it doesn't always
[SPEAKER_05]: work that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do find some evidence for selection
for firmness, but certainly future studies
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to be required in order to
validate them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So perhaps one of the most interesting
things you can do is take the data and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually calculate how closely related are
all the samples to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So make a giant pairwise genetic
relatedness matrix, and then ask yourself,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, how many of these samples from the
USDA collection are clonally related?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually essentially genetically
identical, barring some genotyping error.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see most accessions in the
collection do not have another clone in
[SPEAKER_05]: the collection, but about a quarter of
them do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have at least one other tree in the
collection that is named differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them have multiple trees that
are all actually the same variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case of Golden Delicious,
there are 22 Golden Delicious in the
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 15 Red Delicious, 10 Macintosh,
and 8 Northern Spy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can represent that here as a
network where every single dot here is an
[SPEAKER_05]: accession in the collection, and a line
between them, or an edge in the network as
[SPEAKER_05]: we call it, represents a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the clonal relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that there are quite a few
that have one clonal relationship,
[SPEAKER_05]: two, three, four, five, six isn't very
common, but then seven or more is really
[SPEAKER_05]: quite common.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see several varieties that have
seven or more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the popular varieties that
have been propagated out and where
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple clones exist and are used.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can do the exact same thing instead
of looking at clonal relationships between
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties, you can look at first degree
relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: So either sibling or parent offspring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, here in panel C, on the
left-hand side here, you see each one of
[SPEAKER_05]: these nodes in the network represents an
accession in the USDA Apple Germacosm
[SPEAKER_05]: collection, and an edge or a line between
them represents a first degree relative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So either parent, offspring, or sibling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see we have in this histogram
on the right-hand side, most varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: have zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there are many, many cases where a
variety does not have a relative in the
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you see many of them have one,
a little bit fewer have two first degree
[SPEAKER_05]: relatives, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them have more than seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Delicious and Red Delicious have
over 60 first degree relatives in the
[SPEAKER_05]: collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about, and 15% of the USDA
collection are actually related to the top
[SPEAKER_05]: eight varieties that are grown within the
United States right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got a huge amount of relatedness
inside this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over half of the collection actually is
interrelated in a series of first degree
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships in this network.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how there's a big clump there
that is all sort of interconnected.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes up over half the collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we say that ultimately,
when we want to do genetic mapping and we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to do it in a large population of
unrelated individuals, well, this is not
[SPEAKER_05]: going to happen in the apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these apples, they're like a big
extended pedigree that you've got inside
[SPEAKER_05]: that collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can quantify the degree to which
they're related in first degree relatives
[SPEAKER_05]: in this manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's particularly interesting I find is
that when you look at those first degree
[SPEAKER_05]: relatives and you highlight, among the
varieties that we've genotyped,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have out of the top 10, we have eight
of the top 10 cultivars that are grown in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of acreage in the USA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, or according to the apple grower
website, something or other, you've got to
[SPEAKER_05]: pick some sort of source.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, these are like eight very
well-known, widely grown varieties in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States are highlighted in red,
those nodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the, again, first degree
relatives are all connected with those
[SPEAKER_05]: edges in the network.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that there are numerous
first degree relationships, golden
[SPEAKER_05]: delicious and red delicious, again,
having over 60 first degree relatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that 15% of the USDA collection
overall is actually connected by a first
[SPEAKER_05]: degree relative to these top eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the top eight in each other,
they're related to each other through a
[SPEAKER_05]: series of first degree relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is not all that different from
what we found in grapes as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: where Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can kind of walk through a series
of first degree relationships down to
[SPEAKER_05]: Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc and
Riesling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all kind of related in a
network of relatedness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see the same thing in apple here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one kind of exception here up
in the top right-hand corner is
[SPEAKER_05]: Honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It only has one first degree relative in
the collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Honeycrisp is an interesting example,
because what we're seeing here when we see
[SPEAKER_05]: this interrelatedness among cultivars,
it does suggest that we've, breeders have
[SPEAKER_05]: made use of the tried and true tested
varieties that are successful in the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense to go and use those as
parents in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what generates a huge number of
first degree relatives in the collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with Honeycrisp, they did,
when they made the initial Honeycrisp
[SPEAKER_05]: cross, they thought that it was a cross
between Honeygold and McCown, or McCoon,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and it turned out with genotyping
afterwards that neither of those were
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the real parents of Honeycrisp as
there are two other varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, Honeycrisp is the only top
successful cultivar here that is not
[SPEAKER_05]: interconnected to the other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that shares very few first degree
relationships with other varieties in the
[SPEAKER_05]: USDA collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect, Sean, that that's going to
change quickly too, because we use so much
[SPEAKER_01]: for breeding programs now and so many of
the new releases that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding programs use Honeycrisp as a
parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to just break in here
because we do have a seminar that ends at
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.30 and want to allow for at least a
couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that students have to move on
for other classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we're going to leave your
concluding slide up here and people can
[SPEAKER_01]: read through that and just let people
either if somebody wants to raise a hand
[SPEAKER_01]: by using the little button below the
participant pane or just jump in here and
[SPEAKER_01]: ask Sean a question now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask with such less genetic diversity,
does that affect the nutritional value
[SPEAKER_04]: more because they're not bringing in new
traits or does that not have anything to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's funny that this less genetic
diversity argument may not really apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because things are related to each
other doesn't necessarily mean that
[SPEAKER_05]: overall there's less genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't been inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we've been inbreeding
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are relatively closely related to
each other, but they're still
[SPEAKER_05]: extraordinarily diverse in heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether that results in less nutritional
value, I think that just needs to be
[SPEAKER_05]: measured.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a measurable thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone could actually agree on what
nutritional value actually is and how to
[SPEAKER_05]: measure it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's outside of my, not my
department.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sean, without another question right
now, maybe if you just wanted to do any
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledgments and then maybe we can just
hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that students may have to sign off,
but we can hang out for a couple of few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and then you have another meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody could give Sean a virtual
acknowledgement and thank him for his time
[SPEAKER_01]: and sharing this data with us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate what you have done and
your research is really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean, if you do have any acknowledgments,
please share those.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did them all at the front and
acknowledged everybody right up front.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can direct people to the website and
then to our Twitter feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you'd like to learn more,
then you can follow us on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun to follow Sean on
Twitter and he does, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: my interest is in the apples, but also in
grapes and many other topics as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: including hemp now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Larry's on the line, so he might
want to follow Sean's Twitter feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a very cool video on Sean's
website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just thought of a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if I ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go right ahead, Connor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things I was wondering is I
noticed that there were some cases where
[SPEAKER_03]: you were able to find loci that may be
associated with adaptation, but it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like, as you said, there weren't,
like for not all the major traits,
[SPEAKER_03]: there weren't always the super like
smoking gum, like super obvious things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if you believe that
for many of these traits that adaptation
[SPEAKER_03]: could be polygenic and if so, like,
how do we actually like tell what genes
[SPEAKER_03]: are involved in that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that adaptation is
polygenic, you don't always detect that in
[SPEAKER_03]: these FST scans super easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a single gene of major
effect, imagine a Mendelian locus that
[SPEAKER_05]: gave a particular advantage and it rose in
frequency and showed a strong signature of
[SPEAKER_05]: selection, then that would be very easy to
detect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, if that trait that's been
selected for is controlled by a thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: genes, then you can imagine doing a genome
scan, you're going to come up probably
[SPEAKER_05]: with nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on how much power you have in
your analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we essentially,
we lack power because we haven't saturated
[SPEAKER_05]: the genome with markers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have really great phenotype data
from multiple individuals and replicates
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the sorts of things that you can
imagine having in a population of corn or
[SPEAKER_05]: rice or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it does become more difficult to
detect that kind of polygenic selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing to consider is that there
may have been no selection, may haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: been really much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how much selection occurs in
each of the crops that we're making use
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in some cases there might not be much
and in other cases there may have been
[SPEAKER_05]: intense selection for certain traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so without knowing what proportion of
the genome do you actually expect to carry
[SPEAKER_05]: a signature of selection a priori,
you don't really have an a priori idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: how much should be under selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really what you're doing in these kinds
of analyses is looking for the lowest
[SPEAKER_05]: hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you do an analysis, for example,
on the color, you find a really strong
[SPEAKER_05]: signature of selection for color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that makes a compelling story and
you've got strong evidence that yep,
[SPEAKER_05]: color was selected for.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're more likely to pick up color
because it happens to be controlled by a
[SPEAKER_05]: one major effect gene, that MIB gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may not find it for things maybe
like firmness or for other loci controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: by too many, they're too polygenic and you
won't find that signature of selection
[SPEAKER_05]: with the data that we currently have or
even with really great data sets.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's controlled by enough genes,
it might be really difficult to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: detect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The genetic architecture of the trait is
critical for your power and ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: detect it in these sorts of genome scans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna, did you still have a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonah, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: My question was over what time scale are
you really looking at this ancestral
[SPEAKER_00]: selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think we all realize now with
all of these breeders that obviously there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot more selection that we see on
specific traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the time scale of that kind of
ancient selection from the more less
[SPEAKER_00]: derived varieties?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when looking at, for example,
the difference between the domestica and
[SPEAKER_05]: the subversi, you'd be looking all the way
back to when they shared a common
[SPEAKER_05]: ancestor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the same thing applies for each
of the analyses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're comparing red and green
apples, what you're looking at is the
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiation since red and green apples
diverged from each other, which might be a
[SPEAKER_05]: really long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not really putting a time scale on
these things that a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is, in fact, in some cases with
really great data, you can do this in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of counting up the number of
generations that and model it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be a little difficult,
I think, in this situation with a long
[SPEAKER_05]: live woody perennial that can one of the
things with apples is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can mate with your great, you can have
an apple mate with its great great
[SPEAKER_05]: grandparents, because there's no real
generational time, which makes the
[SPEAKER_05]: relatedness of the networks kind of
strange and the idea of time and
[SPEAKER_05]: generations a little strange as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because you can vegetatively propagate
them for 200 years and it remains the same
[SPEAKER_05]: individual for 200 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might be tricky, it might be
possible, but I'm not able to give real
[SPEAKER_05]: timelines for the timing of the selection
for these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But needless to say, certainly,
that breeders have honed in a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last 50 years on certain traits
than was the case before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I say breeding, you know,
500 years ago, it may not have really been
[SPEAKER_05]: all that intentional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it may not have been, you know,
making crosses and capturing pollen and
[SPEAKER_05]: making intentional pollination may have
been just keeping the offspring out of
[SPEAKER_05]: from random seedlings that looked the most
desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody else, I think, had a
question, and that will be our last one,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll need a couple of minutes
and then you have a visit with the grad
[SPEAKER_01]: students starting at 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did somebody have a question they wanted
to ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question for you,
Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned about the NAC18 and those
SNPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the nature of those SNPs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a loss of function?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're collecting GBS data, so we get
whatever SNP happens to land nearby and is
[SPEAKER_05]: probably in LD with the functional allele.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we always assume.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that SNP actually happens to be a
non-synonymous SNP in a binding domain of
[SPEAKER_05]: the NAC gene that's described in that
plant genome paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may be functional, but we've done
some additional sequencing of NAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out there's all sorts of
variation in NAC that could be functional
[SPEAKER_05]: that is linked to that D5Y mutation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to do a more comprehensive
sequencing of that entire gene across a
[SPEAKER_05]: large number of accessions, plug that
genotype data back into the GWAS and see
[SPEAKER_05]: which of the markers is really most
strongly associated with the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also like a huge deletion right in
the middle of one of the domains too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be a presence-absence
variation, a copy number variation,
[SPEAKER_05]: or a structural variation going on within
that gene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to try to tease that out
with a little more additional sequencing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to date, no, the causal allele at that
locus is not known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, if it was up to me, I would just
say this is the rest of our day,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'd just keep you on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know you have other appointments for
the afternoon, and other people have other
[SPEAKER_01]: activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, everybody, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join me in thanking Sean for his time and
his sharing his expertise and his research
[SPEAKER_01]: with us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
