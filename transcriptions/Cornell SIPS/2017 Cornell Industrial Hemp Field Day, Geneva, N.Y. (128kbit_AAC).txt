[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to welcome everyone to
Cornell University's New York State
[SPEAKER_09]: Agricultural Experiment Station,
part of the College of Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_09]: Life Sciences at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Christine Smart, and I'm the
director of the School of Integrative
[SPEAKER_09]: Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our hope for today is actually to have
everyone, I mean we're going to introduce
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of the hemp team at Cornell,
at least those of us that are here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll have some folks describing
some of the research that's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my goal is really to have folks out in
the field looking at the hemp and
[SPEAKER_09]: interacting with our hemp team.
[SPEAKER_09]: So once you know what folks do,
you have a question about the overall
[SPEAKER_09]: project.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, I'm pretty much the
administrator of the project, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: the other folks here are doing some of the
research.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have questions about economics,
you can talk to Judd, who you'll meet.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have questions about the varieties
we have here, we have experts on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I always think it's fun to be out
and walking around the plant and asking
[SPEAKER_09]: questions there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you're up?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the internet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't actually have a copy of the agenda
item.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to go with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why don't you start with.
[SPEAKER_09]: The variety trial?
[SPEAKER_05]: With Jamie.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we have out here is a variety
trial.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the trial is planted at six different
locations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four near the Ithaca campus, and two here
up in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie Crawford is here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on up, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_09]: She works for Don Byans, who is one of the
co-leads on the project.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she'll talk briefly about the trial.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a handout.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a handout.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have that, we can pass those
around.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I work for Don Byans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very excited to be here and to talk
to all of you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we first got started on this
project, it was kind of an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were able to line up the 17
different varieties that you'll see out
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the trials today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll want to grab a handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got here a little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on these handouts, we'll see there's 13
different grain and dual purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got four different fiber
varieties that we're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the front of the page, there's a little
bit of information on the different trial
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and planting dates and the sorts of
soils that are in those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's everything from very
well-drained so there's a gravelly field
[SPEAKER_00]: and a sandy field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got some somewhat
poorly-grown spots that we're planting
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to sort of see the full spectrum
of how it's going to perform in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our trials, we planted them in four
foot by 20 foot blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each variety replicated four times in
each trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be able to get some good field
estimates from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aim for 3 quarters inch planting depth
in all of our locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And except for one, where we know the soil
packs really tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers are going to want to know
something about the soil for how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: planting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they're going to have to
use as a basis for your planting depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if that half inch planting depth,
we had poor establishment because we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool snap right after planting and rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have planted corn before,
you know you don't want to plant it before
[SPEAKER_00]: a cold snap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp is even more sensitive than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had good establishment in all of our
trials except for the one where it got
[SPEAKER_00]: done into the 40s with a cold rain
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our first trial we had about an
average of 12 plants per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one was closer to
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were only planted five days
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that three day window after planting
is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Amelia's going to tell you a little bit
about our other trials around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the one behind you,
which is looking very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she'll tell you about some of our
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll pass it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been- Amelia, I want you to
introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am Amelia.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the research, the hemp research intern
this summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with the help of our student employees,
I've been collecting data on all of our
[SPEAKER_08]: trials in Ithaca, East Ithaca,
and Freeville on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: These data include notes on height,
stand, and flowering.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, all of our varieties are
in bloom now, even the fiber varieties,
[SPEAKER_08]: which have been bred in bloom much later
in the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that I've noticed is that the
Mauniches varieties, which are the plants
[SPEAKER_08]: that have male and female plants,
or male and female parts on the same
[SPEAKER_08]: plant, flower later than the Dianiches
varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mauniches varieties also seem to have a
slower but much steadier and more linear
[SPEAKER_08]: growth rate than the Dianiches varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dianiches varieties have had a growth
spurt earlier in the season, which has
[SPEAKER_08]: declined since they started to flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: This pattern of growth has created major
differences in height between the
[SPEAKER_08]: Mauniches and Dianiches varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mauniches varieties on pretty much all
of our trials are between one and three
[SPEAKER_08]: feet taller than the Dianiches varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that we've also learned through
doing these trials so far is that
[SPEAKER_08]: establishment is crucial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hemp seedlings seem to be very weepy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it seems that soil type and
planting date may have its strongest
[SPEAKER_08]: effect on establishment.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we mentioned, our first trial was
planted just five days earlier than our
[SPEAKER_08]: east end of the trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the establishment difference is huge,
and on average, our first trial is almost
[SPEAKER_08]: two feet taller than the east end of the
trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps the planting dates didn't matter
as much, because it's only a five day
[SPEAKER_08]: difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the plants are much shorter,
and they're now having trouble
[SPEAKER_08]: out-competing the weeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: The east Ithaca trial also didn't get the
78 additional pounds of fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_08]: which may have a stronger effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems that it has this very heavy
heater.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our first trial was also planted
following alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was planted, alfalfa was planted there
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may also make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our late Ithaca trial, the second trial on
McAllenfield, was planted just the day
[SPEAKER_08]: after the first grain trial here in
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on average, it's about seven inches
taller.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure whether that's because of
soil type or amount of rain or something
[SPEAKER_08]: else.
[SPEAKER_08]: We plan on combining the grain and the
purpose trial in Ithaca sometime late this
[SPEAKER_08]: summer and into the fall when 70% of the
seeds are matured, which will be very
[SPEAKER_08]: soon, it seems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fiber trial will be harvested
between flowering and seed set,
[SPEAKER_08]: which will probably happen in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your notes posted on the website
somewhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those little nuggets?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any sort of definitive data
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are some of the observations that
we've made.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we have even more solid
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you said fertilizer, was it
triple, or what was put on there?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this trial, 30 pounds per acre of
the 10-20-20.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after they were up, 60 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's consistent with all the
different locations or just here?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another trial on another farm here
in Geneva and we put triple 19,
[SPEAKER_05]: incorporated that at the planting time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And was it based on soil tests?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to balance everything out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or were you doing different fertilizers
for the part of the research?
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Larry Smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a professor and Geneva program leader
in the horticulture section at the School
[SPEAKER_05]: of Integrated Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also hold a joint appointment at
Plant Freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: The question was about fertility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for this initial set of trials,
we wanted to keep it fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tried to standardize the
fertilization process.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would certainly be an important topic
that we want to look at next year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Freeville trial is organic?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's straight manure when you're saying
organic?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on certified organic ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only fertilizer to be on there is
manure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me also say that Jen Gilbert
Jenkins at Morseville is doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: fertilization trials this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to talk a little bit about
how the governor and commissioner has
[SPEAKER_05]: inspired me to have a midlife crisis here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I did buy a Neata convertible
this spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that contributed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Note my eye roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been working for 20 years on
Willow Bioenergy Crops, which you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a two-year-old standard Willow.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in March, we held a hemp summit that
the lieutenant governor attended on the
[SPEAKER_05]: campus, where she announced a $400,000
research grant to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a very strong multidisciplinary
team.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be able to get some good
research done here over this year and next
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were gearing up for that,
planting all these trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the beginning of June,
the governor said, well, we need more than
[SPEAKER_05]: just a few variety trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need thousands of acres of hemp in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be a leader in the country in
hemp production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those of us on the hemp team at
Cornell said, we'll do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started working together with Tim
Sweeney and Jackie Schubb and Chris Lowe
[SPEAKER_05]: and Steve McGratton at Ag and Markets and
the commissioner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were able to secure a $900,000
grant through Empire State Development.
[SPEAKER_05]: That contract, just to give you an idea of
the timeline, that contract was signed on
[SPEAKER_05]: June 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie and her colleague Julie Hanson in
Ithaca worked very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked with Valley Bio in Ontario to
order more than 51,000 pounds of seed from
[SPEAKER_05]: Valley Bio of the cultivar Anka,
which you see here in the trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we worked together with Ag and
Markets to line up growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those growers are here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Gardeneer from Farm Fresh First has
planted nearly 600 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Spope is here from East Amherst.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will have 120 acres planted here
by the weekend, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in total, we will have planted 1,700
acres of this variety across 25 different
[SPEAKER_05]: farm sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a handout here just summarizing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our main aim of that project is to get
growers inspired and also to inspire the
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to send the message that New York is
into hemp in a big way, with strong
[SPEAKER_05]: support from our academic institutions,
Cornell and our SUNY colleagues.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get some data on establishment
methods, because all these growers have
[SPEAKER_05]: used different seeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we standardized was the seeding
rate at 30 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we got three different seed lots,
which have different germination rates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the issues with hemp that
Alan Taylor is going to talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: is the variability in germination rates
and seedling figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our growers are doing some no-till
planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our growers planted with an onion
planter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our growers are harvesting hemp
baby greens, which is becoming quite an
[SPEAKER_05]: item, apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them will, I think, be able to
combine their fields and will be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: measure yields on a fairly large scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of the fields are still to be
planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those fields are effectively planted
for cover crop at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we stand with the hemp
farmer research trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have Judd Reed from Cooperative
Extension.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a team of eight or 10 folks now
spread across the state to help support
[SPEAKER_05]: those farmers and to learn more about hemp
so that we have a strong support network
[SPEAKER_05]: as we move forward into the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Judd?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you introduce yourself, Judd?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you want me to do that for you?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, after you're finished,
maybe if we could just have the Extension
[SPEAKER_09]: folks that are here introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Judd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Judd Reed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with the Cornell Cooperative Extension
team called Harvest New York that tends to
[SPEAKER_06]: look at new emerging crops, emerging
markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of work post-harvest in terms
of analyzing value chains for New York
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so industrial hemp being a new crop
really fit into that, the type of work
[SPEAKER_06]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a colleague of mine, Cheryl Fair,
who works out of our Erie County office,
[SPEAKER_06]: put together a report, an economic report
on the potential of industrial hemp in New
[SPEAKER_06]: York state.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is available.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the table where you signed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I encourage you to grab that on your
way out today.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we tried to do is look at what is the
potential of industrial hemp for New York
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers in terms of what is the return per
acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to do that, we needed to begin to look
at what is the yield per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the price received?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the input costs?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first thing you'll notice if you
look at our report is that there's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of data out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some from different provinces in Canada,
Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and then just
[SPEAKER_06]: a few states as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yield per acre, somewhere around 1,000
pounds, possibly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've got to believe that's going to be
higher, too, if we can begin to get our
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really more of a regulatory
issue than an agronomic issue,
[SPEAKER_06]: just getting those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a little concerned that any data
that you look at from 2017 doesn't truly
[SPEAKER_06]: reflect the total potential of the crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were able to get this ahead of time
and get it in the ground earlier,
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine that that yield is going to be a
lot higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing we have to look at when it
comes to yield is, what are we talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we talking about fiber?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we talking about seed?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the potential market of that seed?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to influence our
economics quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since this is a new crop, there's a lot of
interest in other potential uses of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Larry mentioned baby greens as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm using this as a salad component,
perhaps grown inside greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know there's some commercial
farmers that are looking at this now in
[SPEAKER_06]: the Mohawk Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in 2018, leveraging some of
the funds that the governor announced on
[SPEAKER_06]: that second announcement of funding will
probably going to start looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: trialing hemp as a baby green inside of
some greenhouses in Geneva and Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we'll have production
information on that soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also need to explore what's the
legality of that, of growing this out as a
[SPEAKER_06]: baby green and selling it to a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the most interesting backdrop I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I grow a bunch of baby green hemp
and then sell it to whatever consumer,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the sort of thing we want to
explore and make sure that people
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that they're navigating those
markets properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else I should say, if people are
with me?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's production specialists here as
well that have more agronomic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those people are Mike Hunter,
Jefferson County.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Mike Standert some face as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Janice is here, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other production cooperative extension
people I should mention?
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter Landry is our boss.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that Harvest New York
wants to do is understand better the
[SPEAKER_06]: profitability of this crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to do that, we need to understand what
are the yields of the price that we see
[SPEAKER_06]: from New York farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're growing hemp this year,
you might expect to hear from Cheryl Fair,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, who I work with, or Lindsay Pascho,
who I also work with at Harvest New York,
[SPEAKER_06]: to try to understand the market better.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the prices received so that we
can begin to create some transparency and
[SPEAKER_06]: value chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the real potentials for
this crop is we can grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably a lot of other people who
grow it well too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are we going to have some sort of
competitive advantage with locally based
[SPEAKER_06]: markets, locally New York based
processors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like there's some very good news
on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris or Larry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about the economics, are you guys
going to post the prices you guys paid for
[SPEAKER_04]: the various seeds anywhere?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would say we would.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we would do is probably update
this document with 2017 data.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much real data as we can get from
farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much economic data as we can get and
then update this document.
[SPEAKER_04]: So should I divide 900,000 by 50,000?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you spend all 900,000 on up to a
verse?
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is what was that budget of
the 900,000?
[SPEAKER_05]: So these growers are being compensated by
the acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we fixed the seeding rate at 30
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gave them the exact right amount of
seed for their target acreage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're being compensated $400 per acre
less the cost of seed, not to exceed $50
[SPEAKER_05]: per acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got the seed for two bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the seed for $1.98 a pound,
including shipping from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me introduce Professor Gary
Bergstrom in plant pathology and plant
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Larry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see everybody this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a member of the pest team,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that includes Elson Shields in
entomology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Elson could make it today.
[SPEAKER_03]: My laboratory is very interested in trying
to look ahead to some of the infectious
[SPEAKER_03]: disease problems that we may encounter
that I'm sure we will encounter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Cummings here and Kevin Myers are
with my group and we are looking forward
[SPEAKER_03]: to working with many of you trying the
crop in commercial production to help you
[SPEAKER_03]: out with diagnosing problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I attended, at our professional plant
pathology meetings last week, there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: special session on hemp and cannabis
general diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we've heard is
that there's this myth that there are no
[SPEAKER_03]: pest problems on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is quite untrue.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, what I heard from colleagues in
Kentucky and Indiana and some other states
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been maybe working on this a
little longer than us, that there's been
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of an explosion of realizing pest
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And down the road, as we increase the
acreage and the intensity, we will have a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of things to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as the course of the morning
goes on here, if you don't know already,
[SPEAKER_03]: because of the status of this,
is it really a crop sort of idea or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: a schedule one drug, depending on which
agency you're talking to, there are no
[SPEAKER_03]: registered pesticides for this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that sense, we're all going to be
looking at organic production in at least
[SPEAKER_03]: the initial years of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that does present some problems,
some challenges to us, and we'll learn
[SPEAKER_03]: about that together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that we'll need to work on some
cultural practices at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_03]: things like the sequencing of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to avoid crops that have a similar
spectrum of disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that we're somewhat concerned about
New York State because of our rotations is
[SPEAKER_03]: white mold, sclerotinia white mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we're in rotation with things
like soybean, a number of our vegetable
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, we already have issues with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that hemp's quite susceptible
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing I learned from this
symposium last week, that the spectrum of
[SPEAKER_03]: problems on the greenhouse grown,
like for the baby greens, is almost
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different spectrum of problems
than what we encounter in production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to be attuned to that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to belabor a lot of Latin
names with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of pests that we're
going to be on the lookout for and just
[SPEAKER_03]: want you to know that we're here to serve
and work with you on diagnosing and
[SPEAKER_03]: learning together how we can best manage
some of those problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, you're up for introducing yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see quite a turnout that we
have here this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just two weeks ago that hit the
government on the first Hemp Field Day
[SPEAKER_02]: there and had about an equal turnout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate the interest and
curiosity on this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Alan Taylor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a faculty here at the Experiment
Station, a professor in seed science and
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my involvement in this project is
really looking at the quality aspect,
[SPEAKER_02]: starting from seed testing, of the
different lines and varieties that we see
[SPEAKER_02]: out here, but also to go further into the
research, applied research, of developing
[SPEAKER_02]: some seed enhancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to start, as we're really
beginning this work, is really to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about seed quality and what does that mean
just, again, just from the, how do we
[SPEAKER_02]: define the seed quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you that are not really familiar
with agronomic crops and seed quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's really two components.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the germination we would all
expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously the seeds have to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second part is called purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purity of the seed lot is we really
just want say, when you open up that bag
[SPEAKER_02]: of Anka to plant on your farm,
you want to just have seeds of that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else could be there?
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be other crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be wheat seeds, particularly
noxious wheat seeds may be present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those wheat seeds are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also planting wheat seeds in your
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally just inert matter,
which is really just trash material,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all is how, as we've had to
import seeds from all these trials are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from two main companies,
seed companies up in Canada and the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: from Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning more about the Canadian system is
there are close neighbors here to the
[SPEAKER_02]: north.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly they have to have an APHIS permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: An APHIS permit is a very general,
it just allows them to export seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no specifications or
requirements as far as the germination is
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: A germination test is performed on the
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also noxious wheats, noxious wheats are
defined by the state or for the province
[SPEAKER_02]: to be considered harmful to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only other thing that's reported
is if there's other crop seeds in excess
[SPEAKER_02]: of five percent, which is quite a bit of
other crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you say where are these other crop
seeds coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: As Gary mentioned, there are no label
pesticides and that includes herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ground that that's planted in
Canada is Michael Luce and my program is
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there are, we found oat seeds,
sunflower, buckwheat, a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different contaminant other crop seeds are
already present in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that's really not
desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway we are in a point right now of
just basically of having seeds imported to
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and particularly to New York State for the
production of this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada is has some some standards I want
to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a certification, we're familiar
with seed certification here, but theirs
[SPEAKER_02]: is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have certification level one,
number one, or number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the criteria for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a certified number one,
the seed line would have to be over 85
[SPEAKER_02]: percent germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd have to have three or less wheat
seeds present and a 25 gram sample and
[SPEAKER_02]: then less than one crop, one or less crop
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 25 grams, it's about a shot full so I
think everybody can understand that by
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement of what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the criteria for number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it fails, the seed line either blow
germination or there's other more wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds present, then the next category is
their number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, the germination needs to be
70 percent or higher and then higher
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold the number of wheat seeds and
the other crop seeds would be present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 17 lots out here, I should say
17 varieties, but I think really the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: lot level of a variety as each lot can
vary from one other within the same
[SPEAKER_02]: variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of the data that we've collected so
far, Michael in my laboratory,
[SPEAKER_02]: only 30 percent of those would have
greater than 85 percent germination and
[SPEAKER_02]: only about half of them over 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see the quality of the seed that
we're importing here can be very variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a good quality seed is very
important to get us started on the right
[SPEAKER_02]: foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: In communication with one of the Canadian
seed companies, again because they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: what even they call, they're certified is
not exactly what we are defined in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to, based on our
conversations, actually put on the percent
[SPEAKER_02]: germination and the thousand seed weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, things that we're used to on our
seed tags, they do not require that but
[SPEAKER_02]: since they are exporting, that's something
that they can add.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that will be helpful for next
year as we look forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we're focused right now on just
doing these standard routine tests
[SPEAKER_02]: following standardized procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any seed testing laboratory in the United
States or Canada would be following the
[SPEAKER_02]: same rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from there we're going to move forward
in looking at seed quality and seed bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we develop a practical seed,
bigger test, especially as Jamie is
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, under a good soil
condition, you get a good stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under a cold, wet condition, the stand is
reduced over 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to better understand seed
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there more high quality seed lots,
higher, bigger seed lots?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be able to identify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The standard germination test simply does
not have the power to resolve seed bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other aspect is we're starting off
with a fairly weak seed to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they get established and growing,
then they grow pretty vigorously as we can
[SPEAKER_02]: see out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's that very early germination,
early seedling establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the critical stages of getting
them up and growing out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're interested in kind of the seed
technology tools that we're developing
[SPEAKER_02]: really for small seeded vegetables and
also for organic production of seed
[SPEAKER_02]: enhancements to try to enhance,
to stimulate that early seedling growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also as we do not have any chemical
seed treatments that we can use to control
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal diseases, what can we do kind of,
again, going to the organic toolbox and
[SPEAKER_02]: see can we use that and apply those as
seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for sake of time, if there's
any questions at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your germination rates for these posted
somewhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at this time, but we will be doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're correlating a lot of information
right now in the field, the stand
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment, and other growth
parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for all the postings, has it got to go
through a whole process before they're
[SPEAKER_04]: able to post it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like in the fall or can you post
notes as you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris handled that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question was, can we post notes as
we go?
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that incomplete data is not
useful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that if you don't have all the
germ rates from all the seed lots,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's probably not useful to post it yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But those will be posted.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a blog that Jamie Cummins is in
charge of.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everything will be posted on the
website.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will go up as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only trick is we're planning for next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even some data would be helpful as
opposed to waiting for the, if it has to
[SPEAKER_04]: go through a publication, process,
which I understand has to happen for the
[SPEAKER_04]: official stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'd be nice if there was like an
informal update on what we're finding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to plan for next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd be happy to have a personal
conversation rather than posting things
[SPEAKER_05]: publicly before they're ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why today while we're here,
I'll hand the microphone off to Jamie in a
[SPEAKER_09]: sec.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the hope is that we'll wander around
and you'll actually be able to talk to the
[SPEAKER_09]: folks that have those data and get that
information.
[SPEAKER_09]: As preliminary data, as soon as you post
something, someone will download it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they won't have the final
version.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a bit of a nervousness about
posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to say you need to be a
little bit careful because seed lot data
[SPEAKER_00]: is not the same as variety data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because we got two seed lots in
our variety trial that were just awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was because they were old seed
lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say anything about those
varieties in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be careful about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, I have a question for Larry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you were talking about seed
enhancements.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were talking about something like
T-42.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I supposed to be OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, what are we calling
seed enhancements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed enhancements is kind of a general
term, which could be the seed treatments,
[SPEAKER_02]: could be a beneficial seed treatment as
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: As trichoderma would be as a seed
treatment to control cell-borne pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have what we call
myostimulants, which are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: different natural plant materials to
actually enhance the germination rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these two can kind of go in concert
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ultimate goal here is to protect,
but also to enhance the early germination
[SPEAKER_02]: and stand establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question and clarification of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you able to test germ rates for
different seeding depths?
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is on seeding depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let Larry as the seeder spend his
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think because we have these same
varieties planted on six different sites,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll get an idea of that consistency by
variety across the six different sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four reps on each site.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we have a pretty good
replication of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The salad greens, is that being grown in
hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones that I've seen are not grown in
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're grown in soil mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you've seen as well?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think what we're curious about is,
I think the first question would be,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's the fertility approach to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's going to be organic inside of
the greenhouse, that takes a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: finesse to get those fertility levels
where they need to be, particularly around
[SPEAKER_06]: some nitrogen issues, where nitrogen is
not available in soil mix very easily,
[SPEAKER_06]: oftentimes, for organic production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Conventional would be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the Canadians doing much?
[SPEAKER_09]: From the folks I've talked to,
everything is for seed, predominantly for
[SPEAKER_09]: seed and some fiber, not roots.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so Peter, did you have anything
you wanted to add before I pass it on to
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any comments from the field,
from the farms that you guys have visited?
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed control is an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to find the plants in somebody's
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every grass and broadleaf you can find is
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing on that topic is that Kevin
has been taking weed counts in the general
[SPEAKER_03]: weed pressure in the various trials,
and it's directly correlated to that
[SPEAKER_03]: initial stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a cultural practice, getting a good
initial stand is very good competition
[SPEAKER_03]: against the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I showed up today, so he's like,
wow, that's what it's supposed to look
[SPEAKER_09]: like?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was Mike and Gary saying that weed
control is definitely an issue,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we've seen that in some sites as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I encourage everyone now that you know
sort of who knows what, that when we begin
[SPEAKER_09]: to walk around, you can ask folks more
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jackie from the New York State
Department of Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exciting for us to get out of
the office and come out and see the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: in production, and we're very excited
about the potential here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this crop, it's something emerging for
New York State growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very thankful to Cornell, Larry,
Chris, and the CCE team for helping us in
[SPEAKER_01]: this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I'd be remiss if I did not
mention our appreciation to Suni
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrisville, who really led the way in a
lot of what is going on now that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing last year, so we have a little bit
of history, while not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are here are representing
the regulatory facet of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a very cumbersome,
difficult area to navigate, and I also
[SPEAKER_01]: have to take the time to thank the Ag and
Markets team, because while I represent
[SPEAKER_01]: the Commissioner's office and the
Governor, I've got a great group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, and the Commissioner has a great
group of people behind him and working on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim Sweeney is here, who's Special
Assistant for Works is now targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you know Chris Loeb, our Division
Director of Plant Industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is up to here in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then absolutely, while you don't see
them, they're very essential, and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: our Council's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: To start out, we all need to know that the
2014 Federal Farm Bill provides or gives
[SPEAKER_01]: authority to State Departments of
Agriculture and educational institutions
[SPEAKER_01]: to conduct agricultural research projects
on industrial hemp, and I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasize the word research.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State and the Governor signed a
couple pieces of legislation putting laws
[SPEAKER_01]: into place that allow us to move forward
with pilot programs that allow us to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: process, and sell products from those
research projects, and much of what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard here this morning is our partnership
with CORE now, initially with the $400,000
[SPEAKER_01]: through these preliminary research trials,
but then to take it out in the field and
[SPEAKER_01]: start gathering some agronomic data on
farms across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to emphasize that it is the
grower's responsibility to identify a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: International seed must be obtained
through a DEA authorized source at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Governor's direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Department is working towards getting
a DEA permit where we will be able,
[SPEAKER_01]: once it's in place, to facilitate seed
coming into the state from international
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the process of that,
and we have been in the process for quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a while on that, and we're hopeful to get
that in place so that we can go out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: solicitation hopefully towards the fall
with enough time that farmers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested, farmers and businesses that
are interested in doing a research project
[SPEAKER_01]: can research, identify a seed source,
and then we would work with them to
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate it getting to the farms and to
the businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are in the process of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, we're hoping to do a
solicitation or to look for some more
[SPEAKER_01]: research projects this fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the seed front, we are focusing our
efforts internally on the need for good
[SPEAKER_01]: viable seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard a lot of conversations about
that here this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at our seed lab to maybe run
some tests on some of those things that
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan has mentioned as far as germination,
inert, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also looking, and was one of the
initiatives underway, it'll take us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little time, but a seed certification
program in New York State in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big things, and I forgot to
mention it, is this program initially
[SPEAKER_01]: started out with 10 sites that were
authorized by state law, and we as an
[SPEAKER_01]: agency decided to start out with
educational institutions with those 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: and had four of those institutions come
forward, Cornell being one, and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked to the tremendous interest in
getting growers involved and businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expanded those 10 to private businesses
and farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor of the state of the state
came out and said, no, we're opening this
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be growing, looking at this
crop beyond 10 sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have the ability to expand the
program and look at other research
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a working, we also announced an
industrial hemp working group,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to have discussions about where
the areas of need are in the research
[SPEAKER_01]: arena so that they can help guide the
agency as to what kind of projects we look
[SPEAKER_01]: for, and we're also on the processing and
looking for a rolling kind of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're considering now,
rolling application for processors versus
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where with the grower ones, you'll have an
application period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also investigating just a processor
license just to know where the processors
[SPEAKER_01]: are, where the potential markets are for
the crime, so that they are on our radar
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also through partnering with the
entire state development, they've come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with processing grants up to $500,000 for
processing grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also working, having some
initial conversations with the Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Health with respect to any of the food
supplement areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having some conversations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is, oh also we, our
regulations that are in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: currently this program started out with
educational institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our regulations that are on the books
solely pertain to educational
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other entities that are involved in
this program have been operating under
[SPEAKER_01]: department guidance and partnership
agreements with the agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking to move that arena into
some kind of regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're looking at the
regulations, we are trying to minimize
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we initially came out with a program
that had a lot of checks, checking the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes, making sure, I think we're feeling
much more comfortable with the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would be potentially making
regulatory changes that lightened up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulations that are in place and also
bringing the, putting those guidance into
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really for the protection of
everyone involved in this county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a schedule one drug,
so everyone needs to keep that at the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of their mind when they're exploring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, did I miss anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the guidance documents being updated
and that should be released along with the
[SPEAKER_04]: new applications here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're waiting, we're somewhat
sitting tight because we'd like to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really where we are as an
agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get the DEA permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably it has been two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be a little, I don't want to
hound them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're navigating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very diligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is coming from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that the agency is
involved in in a very big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've done a pretty good job
so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a huge undertaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the best partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a little bit on,
you're going to have a large volume of
[SPEAKER_04]: testing with this 2,000 acres in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a little bit on the state
of readiness when you start taking our THC
[SPEAKER_04]: test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't have Chris here
with me, but I know he has a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of it's going to be,
I don't know if I see it on the bench
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but I think it has to do with the
source of seed and the comfort level
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make sure that's another issue
that we're working through is lab
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are, all I can say is we're aware
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working every day on that issue,
capability for the regulatory agency to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull our regulatory samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the whole kind of
service sector that's out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that want to have their crop
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole other area.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're aware of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to answer your question a little bit,
Mark, we do have cooperation with our
[SPEAKER_05]: Institute of Biotechnology on the Ithaca
campus.
[SPEAKER_05]: To test all the samples from the six
trials, all 17 varieties for the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid spectrum of compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, in talking with Chris
Logue, because ANCA is a certified
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar in Canada, our concerns about
that are a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: You test only the cannabinoid profiles or
you test flavonoid profiles?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been the one that's been talking
to Joss Rose.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is the head of our metabolomics
facilities at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a plant biologist in the School of
Plant Sciences.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said that to start with,
they're planning to do the cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_09]: panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So more than just the CBDs, a more broad
panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of folks are going to want
to know what all is available.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not a regulatory issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just an informational component.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once we determine, based on
standards, how well we can do,
[SPEAKER_09]: then we'll be able to provide a better
idea of the breadth of testing that can be
[SPEAKER_09]: done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, there'll actually also be a
protocol for exactly how the samples are
[SPEAKER_09]: collected in the field for that testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our protocol will be identical to that
that Ag and Markets is using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Chris and his team are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know with Wadsworth, Department of
Health Wadsworth, we had a conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: with Chris Smart here as to how to achieve
that consistency while we have
[SPEAKER_01]: participated and gone to other parts of
the country to see how the samples should
[SPEAKER_01]: be taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that protocol is determined,
we will then be doing outreach to our
[SPEAKER_01]: Horton inspectors, a few key Horton
inspectors that will be responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling those samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any expectations at the
federal level for the next farm bill?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I think it's on our radar
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put words in anyone's
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the governor is aware, the
commissioner is very aware of this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we understand that there's at least a
foot in the door in the farm bill with
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a bill introduced in Congress
now to relax some of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that made me think of something
that the whole thing we're working under
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't sunset with the 2014, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be reauthorized or does
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're starting to look at it as a
whole as an agency at the farm bill and
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to have discussions and
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to hear from folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So point person on, I would guess,
on federal farm bill, who I work closely
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the commissioner's office with at
the Jeff Palmer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we would love to do now is have
everyone just sort of go out and wander
[SPEAKER_09]: through the field.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have questions on seed for Alan,
on diseases for Gary and his team,
[SPEAKER_09]: the mics and Janice have been out in the
field so you can get ideas from them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please just interact with us,
ask us any questions you have,
[SPEAKER_09]: and enjoy the hemp.

University.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
