[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jacob Johnston.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with the project YardMap at the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a citizen
[SPEAKER_01]: science program aimed at creating habitat
in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: YardMap essentially allows scientists to
better understand how landscape use and
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening choices affect birds and
wildlife populations in residential or
[SPEAKER_01]: urban settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of us have yards that were at
one time a wild space before it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: yard, before it was a city, before it was
a neighborhood, before it was anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're sort of getting back into
this culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at ways that we can share
the space with ecological sort of concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: and techniques using ecology in the way
that it has been proceeding through
[SPEAKER_01]: centuries of time in order to coexist,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a new understanding of
sharing spaces and a new concern for the
[SPEAKER_01]: greater concern for the environment over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so YardMap seeks to help, I guess,
use that concern a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also nurture it and help people to
make better decisions based on education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that citizen science
is really all about is using the public to
[SPEAKER_01]: not only teach them more about what
they're doing and what they're interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in, but also to provide better data back
for us so that we can create better best
[SPEAKER_01]: use practices, best practices,
and things like that to send back out to
[SPEAKER_01]: those citizen sciences and to the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in sharing, ecologically sharing the
space, you would have room for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have a vegetable garden or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have some wild areas and some
culture and some native lands around it,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, like forest edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of us are backyard
conservationists these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is becoming a very big part of
environmentalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is becoming a very big part of our
culture and society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that there's a lot of people
out there that are enthusiastic about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they want to participate in
protecting nature and conserving birds,
[SPEAKER_01]: wildflowers, trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's this great big push for
pollinators, like bees and butterflies and
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we engage the backyard
conservationists?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get people to put forth the
effort and collaborate and work together
[SPEAKER_01]: and join knowledge and essentially be a
more refined and robust tool?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what the Kona Lab of
Ornithology excels at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do here is focus collective
talents to solve problems that people in
[SPEAKER_01]: urban and residential areas may be
noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of programs at the Kona Lab
of Ornithology that monitor different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of environments, different types of
habitats, and different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: activities that birds and, of course,
another wildlife engage in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more citizen scientists we have
out there telling us what is going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the backyards and the neighborhoods and
things like that of places, then the more
[SPEAKER_01]: we can understand how those animals are
using it, what they need, and what is not
[SPEAKER_01]: working and what is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the lab, we revolve around bird
conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, there's over 350,000 people
engaged in bird conservation activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are citizen scientists mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why birds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we interested in birds?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it special about birds that has
such a draw and has such an engagement
[SPEAKER_01]: with the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very charismatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're indicators of environmental
health, their migration patterns and
[SPEAKER_01]: distributions, and tell us a lot about the
environments that they use, the habitats
[SPEAKER_01]: that they utilize, and where they can and
can't go, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell us the population densities and
their abundance and diversity can tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot about the environmental health as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They occur in all different types of
habitats.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a greater prairie chicken that
occurs in a very small year-round range
[SPEAKER_01]: from about Kansas, I think up through
North Dakota, just in a small band there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the arctic tern,
who has a 24,000, 25,000 mile migration
[SPEAKER_01]: range from pole to pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes an entire year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this bird here is circumglobal,
whereas the other one is a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: niche habitat that's pretty specific to
what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arctic tern as well, on the coasts and
in the poles where it breathes and
[SPEAKER_01]: overwinters, requires a certain type of
habitat, but also all the spaces in
[SPEAKER_01]: between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every connecting point that it lands and
stops on its year-round migration needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be some sort of habitat and some sort of
space for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use birds because they encompass the
entire globe and they encompass almost
[SPEAKER_01]: every aspect of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have really unique and amazing
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kill deer is known for its impressive
display of being broken or wounded when
[SPEAKER_01]: you approach its nest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds a nest here in the gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might even be able to find a nest if
you look closely in the gravel,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's very camouflaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when a predator or a threat approaches
the nest, they sort of limp away with a
[SPEAKER_01]: broken wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bend their wing funny so it looks
broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these intricate and unique habits that
birds have interest people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really grab people's attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become these very charismatic fauna
that gain support from the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be anything from meek to
majestic, like this red-tailed hawk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's found across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very integrated into our
lives, into our urban and rural
[SPEAKER_01]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share our world with them whether we
know it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see the snowy owl in this
picture, there it is, which is not an owl
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see very often, but they do
incorporate themselves into our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we want to know is how can we
best coexist with them because they
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate, they're going to live there,
they're going to be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many they are and how healthy they are
is sort of up to us now that we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what their needs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So birding is a very, very popular
recreational pastime.
[SPEAKER_01]: 85 million Americans across the country
participate yearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: $900 million are invested annually in bird
watching and birding and support like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our biggest programs at the Lab of
Ornithology here in Citizen Science is the
[SPEAKER_01]: eBird program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the Project Feeder Watch,
which has 17,000 users that participate in
[SPEAKER_01]: a four-month feeder watch study through
the winter and early spring where they
[SPEAKER_01]: watch, they put out bird feeders and put
out different types of feed and different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food for the birds and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they collect the data,
they count the birds and they report that
[SPEAKER_01]: data through online tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nest Watch grew 32% in 2013 and it's on
track now to break the 20,000 nest record,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, to break a record of 20,000
nests protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really getting big and popular
and this is a program that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in where you locate nests you
actually have to take a training course
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn how to be a part of the Citizen
Science Project so that you don't infringe
[SPEAKER_01]: on the safety or the health of these birds
while they're nesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people really appreciate
that and learn a lot of appreciation and
[SPEAKER_01]: respect and have a lot of gained
admiration through projects like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that's really popular is Cubs
Celebrate Urban Birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one boasts over 250,000 members from
about 23,000 urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentor disadvantaged kids and they
even have a program where they teach
[SPEAKER_01]: birding by ear to blind youths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all these programs and they're
all online and they have some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell Lab of Ornithology has some of the
best tools for engaging citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one thing that's missing,
something that's a little more personal,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more closer to all of us,
and that's our yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why would we want to focus on yards?
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is it with yards that drew
our attention and made us want to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we take a look at the average
American yard, we see that it's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: bird friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's not really environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the average American lawn is about 60%
of the grass and it contains a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: impervious areas like the grass,
like the driveway here and the rooftops.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually a small area for maybe a
flower or vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of our property, our American
yard is lawn and that lawn is not a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to encourage a reduction in
lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually one of our nation's biggest
crop and it's not very good habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this increasing growth of urban
and residential areas across the country
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, or every year, I'm sorry,
about the size of West Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes settled, urbanized,
or somehow turned in from wild habitat
[SPEAKER_01]: into human habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the growth is growing at a rate that is
hard to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we want to do is instead of
changing that habitat into something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to work with that habitat,
with yard map.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to encourage people to think small
with their lawns, be environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, and use other types of
landscaping in your yard besides a lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: that is more effective and more efficient
in providing habitat for birds and
[SPEAKER_01]: wildlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bee there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a collection of wildflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously much more bountiful and
plentiful and environmentally friendly for
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of creature that may be wandering
through your yard or flying overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we create habitat for birds and
wildlife in our yard?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the main ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that we need to focus on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the main ingredients are food,
water, and shelter, just like anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and freedom from danger, which is
something that isn't always at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the list or at the front of our thoughts
when we're creating habitat in our yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food, water, shelter, and freedom from
danger creates a habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do we mean when we talk about
food?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bird feeder with seed is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can provide food for birds in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't realize though,
or maybe they don't realize that birds eat
[SPEAKER_01]: more than seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most birds eat mostly bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a Eastern blue bird doing the
caterpillar thwomp, I think they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high force smash onto something
that breaks the skin apart and makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, they eat caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: A single pair of breeding chickadees needs
75,000 caterpillars per season to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five nestlings.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we get these caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we bring in the bugs to feed the
birds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we look at some data that was
produced shortly ago, we see that
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillar richness, the diversity of
caterpillars, the number of caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the number of species greatly
outnumber the number of caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of species on non-native or
introduced invasive plants as compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: native plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woody plants are even much greater
attractant to butterflies and anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that lays eggs and produces
caterpillars or larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to provide food, we need to provide
plants that provide bugs that provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to provide water for birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get water out of the food they eat
and they get water flying around over
[SPEAKER_01]: lakes and ponds and things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move around a lot, but they don't
always, they don't move a lot every day
[SPEAKER_00]: or, let's see, I'm sorry, I'm mixed up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so providing water in strategic places
across the landscape such as yards really
[SPEAKER_01]: makes this connectivity across the
landscape and increases the chances of
[SPEAKER_01]: finding habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about water, it could be
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a pond or a creek
running through your yard, if you do,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're providing water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, say if you're in a suburban
area or a dense urban area, then there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other ways you can provide water
for birds like bird baths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are some tips that we provide on
yard map for the, you know, for ideal bird
[SPEAKER_01]: baths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want them to be safe,
we want them to be clean, and we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to be traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too deep of a bird bath or if
it's not clean on a regular basis or if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's shrouded by shrubs or trees,
then they can be preyed on by cats,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the great things about citizen
science is this back and forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: this call and response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put water in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we get this response back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I put water in my yard, but these
birds drowned in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why did they drown in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we understand what better and more
effective and efficient types of water we
[SPEAKER_01]: can provide for birds, and it goes back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Structure is another thing that's very
important to provide in your yard for
[SPEAKER_01]: birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds need structure to perch on,
to display from, from mating, to call
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need structure to build nests in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And structure can be any number of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Structure means anything from vertical
height to horizontal width to texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little advertisement that we put
out through yard map that talks about the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of structure in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds aren't taxonomous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily know the species of
the plants in your yard, but they do know
[SPEAKER_01]: the texture of the needles or the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do know the density of the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do know the height of the tree or the
quality of the wood that is being built,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're building their nests out of
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a diversity, they're
actually experts at what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are the ones that are capable of
providing it or not taking it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say if we're building a new home
somewhere, and instead of clearing all the
[SPEAKER_01]: trees from an area, you could leave them
and just, and even this is another thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we promote here is dead trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes dead trees are more productive
and more, provide more, have more species
[SPEAKER_01]: using them than a live tree does.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called snags, and they're
rotting wood, and they provide homes for
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of bugs, which provides foods
for the birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also provide holes like cavities for
nesting birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that we need besides
food, water, and shelter is freedom from
[SPEAKER_01]: danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be a number of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freedom from danger refers to anything
that may draw your, draw or attract birds
[SPEAKER_01]: or wildlife to your yard, but then hides
or disguises some danger there that you
[SPEAKER_01]: may not know of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear a lot about cats and, oh,
my cat would never, you know, never hurt a
[SPEAKER_01]: bird or maybe only get one or two here and
there, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is birds kill billions of
birds every year because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: billions of cats, maybe killing several a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may not seem like much, but in the
end, it is a very powerful force against
[SPEAKER_01]: bird populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is a graphic that shows freedom
from danger from windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some new recent studies have come out
through a feeder watch that show that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeders that are placed in the wrong space
or too close to a, I'm sorry, too close to
[SPEAKER_01]: a house, but not close enough,
create a deadly collision zone where birds
[SPEAKER_01]: frightened from a feeder or startled from
a feeder will gain enough speed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not have enough, I guess, agility to
clear the house or clear a window.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're closer to the house,
their speed is not that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're farther from the house,
then they have the distance to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a zone that we found through
citizen science that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is more deadly for placing feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when to mow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you have large yards,
mowing can endanger fledglings or
[SPEAKER_01]: nestlings that haven't fledged yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these things work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all need to work together with us
as we all are integrated in this
[SPEAKER_01]: coexistence that we're discovering more
and more about over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of coexistence, we're realizing
also that a greater diversity of birds and
[SPEAKER_01]: a greater diversity of plants and wildlife
around a neighborhood or around a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people improves their well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is true in almost any demographic and
almost any society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what Yard Map seeks to do is
collaborate with groups of people to join
[SPEAKER_01]: people together and to create a community
of yard mappers, a community of people
[SPEAKER_01]: making connections or connecting points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connectivity is a very big concept in
ecology that connects large expanses of
[SPEAKER_00]: wild areas through small expanses of wild
areas like yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: One yard that's yard mapped and is being
managed for wildlife is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two yards is even better because that
provides stepping stones from,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a national forest to, you know,
Lake Saranac or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have these stepping stones of
habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have stepping stones
connected, you have corridors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have corridors and stepping stones
and all of this when a community works
[SPEAKER_01]: together to provide all the necessary or
essential parts of a habitat across the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape, that's when we can all make a
really big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
Thank you.
