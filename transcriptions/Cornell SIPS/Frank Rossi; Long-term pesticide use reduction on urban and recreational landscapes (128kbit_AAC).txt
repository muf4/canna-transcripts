[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see some familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to talk about my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually spend most of my time doing it
and not much time talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: summarizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a really good exercise for me
and sort of tying some things together to
[SPEAKER_00]: give people who have absolutely no idea
what I've been doing for the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: a snapshot of one particular area of my
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Tony said, and I'm very proud to say,
I almost feel I've been around long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to say I'm one of those old-fashioned
extension scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe very strongly in my
commitment as an extension specialist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to see that in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the pleasure, of course,
you can't avoid being involved in basic
[SPEAKER_00]: research at some level at this place,
and I've always had the pleasure of being
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm going to talk to you today
about is this intersection of
[SPEAKER_00]: systems-based research done at the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: level and changing people's behaviors and
using data to drive your education
[SPEAKER_00]: programs and then further continue to hone
the research and education ideas that you
[SPEAKER_00]: implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the environment that I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we now know as the urban ecosystem,
we've got really nice terms for that type
[SPEAKER_00]: of landscape now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the particular landscape that I
will be talking about today, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: many that we work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Tony said, I've had the pleasure of
working with the practitioners at Central
[SPEAKER_00]: Park, and a lot of the interest that I
initially get is we have a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can you help us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then laws get passed that says,
well, you can't use those things anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have those pesticides anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then not only do you become,
as I am, an extension scientist where you
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of help them solve short-term issues,
they begin to see the long-term challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to face as the people who
think much of this is their front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these people have a fair
amount of affluence to draw upon,
[SPEAKER_00]: affluence and influence to draw upon to
impact the way this particular landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: gets managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spend a lot of time on the
intersection of managing plants in urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Jenny Gowniffen said in her
presentation in our department meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning, the sort of socioeconomic
intersection and understanding how much
[SPEAKER_00]: people are involved in the decisions and
the way things get managed out in these
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the driving forces,
believe it or not, in the urban landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: is mimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fair amount of research that's
been conducted now to say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they see that's the way the landscape's
going to be, that's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it in sort of common vernacular as
keeping up with the Joneses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've observed this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the problems is once one person
does it badly, then you've got it
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also show you a pretty large
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's important to
understand about the urban environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly from a stormwater
perspective, where I really spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: my time thinking about reducing inputs
because of these reasons, is 80% of the US
[SPEAKER_00]: population lives on about 10% of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the urban environments have a,
put exceptional pressure on the ecosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: that service them that most of the time
are not in cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing the urban green infrastructure
into the city now begins to connect this
[SPEAKER_00]: population with an ecosystem that can
service them for their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes they put a disproportionate
pressure on those ecosystems that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: much dispersed from where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of interest in the urban landscape
rebuilding it, building more, and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, all the roles that the stormwater
management system impacts this grass is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover a fair amount of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a 2005 NASA publication by
Malesi and others where they did some
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral scans of the United States to
look at where grass was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by no surprise, grass is where the
people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a lot of grass out here that
people are managing as turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of grass out here,
I assure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of what we call managed turf is
managed in these urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens to be in close proximity
where we pave a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all of a sudden now eliminate a big
component of stormwater management.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, make a lot of problems worse
because where people are, there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be significant amounts of impervious
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that potentially goes onto
that landscape, if it is allowed to escape
[SPEAKER_00]: into those impervious surfaces,
then gets channeled and funneled and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated into some of the other issues
that this wonderful picture I saw on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter the other day, I couldn't help
myself but steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The connectedness of the watersheds and
the rivers that connect our American
[SPEAKER_00]: continental United States society and when
you start looking up in here, I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be surprised if at some point we
start to see laws drawn along the lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: these watersheds as they do throughout
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kinds of connected, this
connective tissue in the water system is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I connect myself to in the urban
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that's ultimately gonna be impacted
by the inputs that we bring into this
[SPEAKER_00]: urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do people use in urban
environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to the tune of about five and a half
billion dollars they spend on lawn and
[SPEAKER_00]: garden products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an enormously large economic
driver in the green industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look just at pesticides and
fertilizers that could potentially have
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient and other health effects,
you're looking at in excess of 50% of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the money is spent on stuff that gets put
on that landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That even if we did sort of crude
percentage losses in the 0.0001 percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: points, you're still looking at enormous
amounts of materials that can concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and get into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when you look at pesticide
use specifically, New York State's been
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping records for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the pounds of
pesticides by county, which is the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: DEC has been collecting them for many
years, you see that some of the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide use gets associated in the urban
areas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, up to Hudson
Valley into Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of pesticide use in urban areas
and lots of rural areas, not as much,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we know there's a lot of
agricultural production going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wonder why someone would be
talking about pesticide use on a golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course or in urban areas, there's an
enormous amount of pesticide used in those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is all of it on lawns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a lot of this could be and is
probably related in urban areas to
[SPEAKER_00]: structural pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say all of this is getting
blanketed on turf and golf courses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for sure, pesticides are a part of our
lives, which is very disconnected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I think many of our citizens view
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they don't use pesticides,
but they don't look under the counter and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the raid and the tick on their lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tick material on their dogs,
which is the same grub control we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns, there's an enormous disconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the stuff ends up tends to be a big
problem, and so my approach to this has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been pollution prevention,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not using it, if we're not
relying on it, the chance that the USGS is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find it in a stream, and oddly
enough, when you see some of their highest
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide concentrations, they tend to
be located at least in the northeast in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these heavily urbanized areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're not immune to this from the
nutrient perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the north and south fork of Long
Island, where they've done some recent
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient use and testing well surveys,
surface and groundwater well surveys,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have found that fertilizers on lawns
and golf courses, because of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of golf courses and lawns in
these affluent areas, there's a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of materials used, and there have
been legislative initiatives in these
[SPEAKER_00]: areas to further restrict the use of these
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been challenged as scientists to
be able to say, well, how can you justify
[SPEAKER_00]: this use?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my colleague and retired colleague
Marty Petrovic spent a lot of his career
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this particular issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pesticide issue continues to,
the restriction of pesticide use continues
[SPEAKER_00]: to gather momentum, and Tony's native land
of Canada, one of your native lands of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, they've really led the charge in
banning pesticide use in urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, primarily on lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Montgomery County, where this
recent legislation was promulgated and
[SPEAKER_00]: about to be passed, it was going to impact
golf courses as well, especially municipal
[SPEAKER_00]: golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that people don't
realize is a lot of municipalities,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the state of New York,
manage golf as a recreational landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they provide opportunities for laws
to be passed that don't have to be voted
[SPEAKER_00]: on by the citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the governor signs an executive order,
that's the way the parks get managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way the municipalities get
managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is they're trying to
get some of these executive orders,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least on public land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Montgomery County went a little bit
further and said, we want to ban it on
[SPEAKER_00]: private land as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you start running into the private
public land issues that we face in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has gone one step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been, the PMRA has been a very
activist organization since the new prime
[SPEAKER_00]: minister came into power, that handsome
looking guy you got up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so chlorothalonil, a very commonly
used contact fungicide, is going under
[SPEAKER_00]: significant restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ipidion, thiophanate methyl, chlorpyrifos,
all of these commonly used turf pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably going to be completely
removed from the market in the next five
[SPEAKER_00]: to seven years in Canada, which I think
doesn't bode well for people who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell chemicals in the United States,
because I think that is exactly the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying it for the better part of
25 years of my academic career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe by the time I retire,
much of what I've been barking about might
[SPEAKER_00]: actually come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you deal with the public that
when you ask them about environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, how do they respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a couple of Gallup surveys I
wanted to make you aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percentage of Americans worrying a great
deal about certain environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of the ones that I work very
closely with, drinking water and
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination of soil and water,
not necessarily by toxic waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pollution of rivers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see for the people who worry about
environmental issues, which is about half
[SPEAKER_00]: of the American population, a full half of
them are very much worried about the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that our work focuses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep these inputs out of those
water bodies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the fascinating thing about the way
people view the environment is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy is not doing well over the last
two decades, since we've started to see
[SPEAKER_00]: more significant financial crises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can track the financial crises on
this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple question that says if
push comes to shove, should we favor
[SPEAKER_00]: economic issues over environmental issues,
or should we face environmental issues
[SPEAKER_00]: over economic issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many, many years, up until the
turn of the century, they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a minute, protection of the
environment should be given priority over
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'd think, wow, we're experiencing
this big environmental movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think what you see is a steady
decline in people interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental quality, certainly at the
level that they're interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their economic life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this creates a number of challenges
when you're constantly talking to people
[SPEAKER_00]: about environmental issues, whether
they're going to be interested in what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying, whether there is a driver
to motivate them to change their behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: by using less products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that goes back to the
sort of socioeconomic stuff that Jenny was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about in our faculty meeting this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph really depicts that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an extension scientist, it's sort of
nice to learn new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I learn new things, I want to see
how I can help change people's behavior by
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that science and putting it to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the stage I'm trying to
set moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on faculty a couple years when this
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spitzer signs an executive order banning
pesticide use on state park land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1998, he comes in for the five
minutes he was governor and really sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: went through and in his normal way sort of
slashed and burned everything and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: real activist agenda and banned pesticide
use on state park land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, so did Suffolk
County Parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I thought was interesting was
what about the 27 New York State Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Park Recreation and Historical
Preservation courses?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that long acronym stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about those courses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about the three courses on Long
Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they just wrote, oh,
these are state parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't eat pesticides on state parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So state parks don't use Roundup anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use any synthetic chemical
pesticides when there's not a golf course
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jennifer Grant, who many of you know,
Dr. Jennifer Grant, is the director of the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been colleagues since really I knew
her even when I was a graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the late 1980s when she was
beginning her work with Rod Ferentino in
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jennifer came and said, look what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we have golf courses without
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, you can't have a golf course
without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, how do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how dead silent the
conversation went after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever tested trying to manage a
golf course without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say organic, otherwise I can
promise you they're using regular chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these executive orders said anything
with an EPA number can't be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the executive order that was
signed when we first started this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she said, how do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it was writing proposals and
the normal process we go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was simply, at first we
pitched the idea to do it on our research
[SPEAKER_00]: plots because as a practical golf course
guy I said, who's going to let us kill
[SPEAKER_00]: grass on their golf course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was fairly sure that was what
was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecologically, if you are maintaining a
golf course for 70 years with pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden you stop spraying
those pesticides, what kind of chance do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think ecologically those plants have
that have been held up all these years by
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing diseases and preventing insect
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances of them working are very less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I blame Jennifer for me being here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, my relationship with her
has been one of the great joys of my
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been fortunate to start working with
the Beth Page Park guys in the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Island training them because it was
announced back in 1997 that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the 2002 US Open,
which was the biggest golf tournament in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't have a staff that even
knew the first thing about how they might
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare a golf course for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were state park workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this golf course, which is one of the
great ones in the world, was left into
[SPEAKER_00]: decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its demise and decline was well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just wasn't money to keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaders of golf wanted to sort of
reinstill public golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the first time the US Open was
held on a truly public golf course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of golf course you sleep in your
car to be able to play first thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had this long relationship with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally will tell you,
I leveraged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said to the park superintendent,
Dave Catalina, at the time, I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, man, you have five golf courses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need one of them to test this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, absolutely, that's what we
should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost gets me choked up every time I
say it because if he said no, I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave us a golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically said, yeah, do what you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2002, Beth Page was a great place to do
it because the world was looking at Beth
[SPEAKER_00]: Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world had their eyes on this golf
course that hadn't been on television
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, hadn't ever hosted a major
tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had to be sort of pulled off in a
five-year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see, it was enormously
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even got to work with my nephew who was
on the grounds crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you do as an
extension scientist in my world is when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's work to be done and there's a
chance to get up and do it, it's a way you
[SPEAKER_00]: build relationships with your peers and
say, hey, he's not just a guy who locks
[SPEAKER_00]: himself up in those rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's out there actually, boy, he knows how
to run a Greensmower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He honestly knows how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do because before I came back to
graduate school, I was a golf course
[SPEAKER_00]: superintendent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say how much of a benefit
this is in changing people's behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the great challenges
environmental groups have in general is
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to change systems many
times from the complete outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how else to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm this guy who's been in the turf
business for 30-something years and have
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently tried to make changes in this
environmental way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, after 25 years, I feel like
some of that work is coming to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what work is like during a US
Open when it rains a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe they actually try to
play golf in this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even wrote a book about the
tournament mentioned a couple of times in
[SPEAKER_00]: this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time, again, the big
tournament was played on a public stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bethpage is a busy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love playing golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll play between 50 and 60 thousand 18
hole rounds a year on the green course
[SPEAKER_00]: that we play on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not uncommon that when you play
at the golf course here, this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the putting green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a group putting their ball in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group here finished putting and is
waiting for these guys to tee off who are
[SPEAKER_00]: teeing off while there's people on the
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a par three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're hitting to the green while
people on the par three are standing back
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for them to head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a constant play, traffic,
and all that foot traffic creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges for living things, of which
grass plants are mowed at about a tenth of
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch when they're experiencing that
traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the Bethpage State Park?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's five golf courses, 1,500 acres,
260,000 rounds across the five golf
[SPEAKER_00]: courses, only 35,000 on the championship
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's second only to the parking lot at
Niagara Falls and income for the state
[SPEAKER_00]: park system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing makes more money than the parking
lot at Niagara Falls, and Bethpage is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically a close second to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our work is being done on the green
course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't necessarily think about that at
the time, but the green course that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the original golf course that was on the
land when Robert Moses bought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, bought is a loose term for Robert
Moses.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sort of said, I want it, and next thing
you know, he had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they built out the golf course
to include five other properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our work was on the green course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to just set the stage for the
first part of the study because the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is actually the second part of the
work that we've been doing in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first 10 years, 13 years,
we were conducting an experiment that was
[SPEAKER_00]: a systems-based trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the easiest way to explain it
is when you go on a diet as a person,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes nowadays there actually are
prescribed foods, but generally you can
[SPEAKER_00]: eat lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weight Watchers has a point system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these many points for this food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't tell you exactly what to eat
all the time, but they say, here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff has to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would describe the way we
approach the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 18 putting surfaces, which is where
we wanted to do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put nine of them under what you're
normally doing on the golf course,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nine of them under what we thought
would be practices that reduce overall
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on the plants and maximize their
ability to withstand pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're under less stress,
theoretically they'll be less exposed,
[SPEAKER_00]: less vulnerable to particularly fungal
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal pathogens, insect predation are the
two big pest problems on these playing
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had nine the way they were doing it
and nine the way we thought they should do
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within those nine surfaces,
we replicated three pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that they normally used, one that we
would call a sort of a progressive IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, and one that initially was
following the executive order.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chemicals with an EPA number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll show you in a minute why we had
to adapt that particular treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ultimately become what we published as
bio-based pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biologicals, reduced risk products that
the EPA indicates as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did, we published a paper in our
International Turfgrass Research Journal
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2009 that summarized our first
seven years of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't expect you to pay attention to
the suite of practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to see that these were
what the cultural management systems
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say cultural management,
it's how you mow, how you fertilize,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are enormously intensive management
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enormous amounts of intervention on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a put the apple tree and see it
in 30 years kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is every day, they're at it doing
something to these playing surfaces on a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different ways to condition
them to perform the way they're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we often call the most
dysfunctional building in the entire state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York, that's the state house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goals of our original project as we
set it out was to first, how do we,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you ban pesticides, what are these
growers gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have, there was no one's ever
sort of said how do you do this with one
[SPEAKER_00]: hand tied behind your back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those questions had never really been
asked before, so we said wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to figure out what sorts of things
work and give policy makers an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would invite them out on a regular
basis during the study to say hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the treatment that the law you are
about to impose, this is gonna be what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when everybody starts managing
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the funeral service for the
second putting surface on the green
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't take long for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two years we made it to July one
year and early August another year and
[SPEAKER_00]: then basically within a week that's what
happens and they die from the most
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly found fungal pathogen that no one
ever worries about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease that actually came in and
killed these surfaces is one that no one,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you ask people what are the top 10
problems, they barely make that top 10
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so common that they just spray all
the time for it and never think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden when you don't have
the tools that solve common problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have alternatives to those
problems, alternatives to solve those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, it becomes very difficult to not
have surfaces like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were putting surfaces that had been
managed with chemicals in various ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes, or form all the way back to
Chlordane in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: These greens had never seen, these putting
surfaces had never seen a growing season
[SPEAKER_00]: without regular pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we stopped doing it two years in a
row, this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the final treatment that
bio-based, sorry, the bio-based pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management here at the bottom had to be
implemented because Dave Cannellano looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at us and said do you have to keep killing
these greens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you learning something?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're learning something by continuing
to kill them, by all means continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill them, but if you're not learning
anything maybe you can stop and we did one
[SPEAKER_00]: more thing before we stopped and that's we
invited the policy makers out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Suffolk County legislators,
we probably had four there and we had two
[SPEAKER_00]: state senators and their aides there for a
twilight field day with about 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 people and we said this is what happens
when your law gets enacted and their
[SPEAKER_00]: comment was oh, I think that there is
this, and maybe you see this in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture as well, there's this
pervasive attitude, what do you need
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard can it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need pesticides for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a golf course, why are you using
them on a golf course?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that we would take away a tool
and it would result in something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: I think speaks to the level of ignorance
that we have in much of our legislatures
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to these kinds of
complicated issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our operating principles with the
project was number one, establish cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that reduce stress, create an
environment that has less problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you're going to intervene
with a product, I can tell you every snake
[SPEAKER_00]: oil salesman in the country found out we
were doing this and said hey, we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic potion for you, Frank, and we had to
immediately say wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: who says that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said well, we tried it in a
greenhouse one weekend on cucumber and it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of stuff that we were
confronted with when we started this work
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So challenges of new technology,
I will say, you know, God bless those
[SPEAKER_00]: people at Bethpage for putting up with,
you know, if I had 10 ideas, one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: might have been a good one, but they let
me try all 10 of them, and we tried
[SPEAKER_00]: brewery waste compost for snow mold,
we had to push the snow off and put the
[SPEAKER_00]: brewery waste down because there was data
that said that would work, and lo and
[SPEAKER_00]: behold, we didn't have snow mold,
but we had the worst case of fairy ring
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole idea, I read a recent paper
recently that increasing pseudomonas has
[SPEAKER_00]: led to more take all patch problems in
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A galminomyces species problem goes up
when you increase microbial activity of a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular microbe, so I think we have a
lot to learn about these sorts of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this drove many of the golf course
guys crazy this one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gone to pharmaceutical grade
microbial fermenters, put these bugs in,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the microbes in there, brew them,
do a slurry, put it in a spray tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: and spray it every day for 150 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that, and it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it certainly reduced some of the
pest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a microorganism, and for a while
they were injecting this stuff into the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system, but it just wasn't
practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been better to bring 100
more pounds of pesticide into the
[SPEAKER_00]: operation than use this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried direct injection sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Landers, when he first came to
campus, had worked with us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pure tank of water with jockey
tanks that it will allow you in real time
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust rates and locations and a
two-fold boom setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a state-of-the-art prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we had an intern that used it,
once that kid left, everybody looked at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and said, I'm not sitting on that thing,
and agriculture's been doing this for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time, and now it's finally
starting to come back to the golf
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, GPS-controlled sprayers,
variable-rate technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 15 years ahead of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this on the golf course 15 years
ago, and we couldn't even get them to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One student did it one year, and we could
never get it going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a big deal with the organic
movement on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of people with a lot of time
on their hands that really believe organic
[SPEAKER_00]: is the solution to every problem known to
man, and if we just used more compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: the world would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the research in Ithaca and
found, and then we actually did it on Long
[SPEAKER_00]: Island as well to appease some of these
real critical people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't think we were doing anything
useful because it wasn't organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct injectors on the side of the
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this actually at the Cornell Golf
Course as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products that you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's billions of dollars spent on
products that have no practical value for
[SPEAKER_00]: use in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what we say, we can't stop them
from using them, but they continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a sense of the golf
course, we're talking about fairly small
[SPEAKER_00]: putting surfaces, about 4,500 square feet,
and they get a fair amount of traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show you this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a seven-year track of the rounds
of golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happened after the first two
years of killing greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when we started, and then the
greens died, and they didn't come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the greens died, and they didn't
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once the state revenue people said,
whoa, we're making less money on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there is something to this golf
course thing that we should pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made some adjustments to our
systems that allowed us that bio-based
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management, and we saw a return in
rounds of golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I show this to people who manage
golf courses as small businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: like many small farmers, they're like,
oh, yeah, when our greens aren't in good
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, people don't like playing here,
or they want a discount on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you how rude Long Island
public golfers can be sometimes when they
[SPEAKER_00]: find they can't play a putting green
because it's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a discount on the round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, speaking of the golfers,
we did interview them regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Jennifer's part of the project
dealing with the golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would survey them and ask them
if percentage of golfers that said they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted you to keep quality high,
use pesticides whenever they might help,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep reasonably good, use pesticides
judiciously, minimize pesticide use
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of quality, and don't use
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you see in this graph that's
fascinating is, particularly in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the study, we didn't show,
we didn't survey them when the greens were
[SPEAKER_00]: dead necessarily, but a lot of these
golfers went through this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an occasional increase,
and when we started looking at this data
[SPEAKER_00]: further, it did track economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better the economy was and the more
they liked playing golf, the less they
[SPEAKER_00]: cared about pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And golfers in general don't care much
about pesticide use in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have sort of grown accustomed to it,
like people who live in agrarian societies
[SPEAKER_00]: and see farmers apply pesticides all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see it as something abnormal
that people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on golf courses, where people don't
normally see other people applying
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, people who are not golfers get
all worked up about it, we find that the
[SPEAKER_00]: golfers tend not to get that worked up
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you rate the overall
condition of the green course in 2008?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had about a 60% very good and
28% adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to say, tough New York
public golf crowd, we've satisfied about
[SPEAKER_00]: 85%, 90% of the public, and we're driving
down pesticide use in this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we surveyed the golfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked them about how they thought
it looked and how they thought it played.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green quality rating by golfers,
looking at our IPM with alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practices, all of them thought
those greens were good and equal to,
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically, the same as the way they've
been doing business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed this alternative
collection of practices that the golfers
[SPEAKER_00]: say is doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consistent with the way they've been
doing business in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can make our adjustments to their
management good for the environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent to the golfer, that's the
sweet spot that I think we were shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: for when we started this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And playing surfaces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can skip over some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We monitored labor hours, because one of
the knocks on alternative or organic is it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not necessarily find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the AC is alternative culture,
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green bar is the standard
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bar is the progressive practices
that we've implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see early on, when we first
started implementing them, it took more
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing the way they managed,
you'd expect things to take more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've gone along, we saw that,
oh, they got used to this different way of
[SPEAKER_00]: management, and then it no longer took
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: More time than the conventional approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fundamentally, the title of my talk is
pesticide use reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk to you about the way we
look about pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, practitioners pick them based
on multiple factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jennifer likes efficacy, economics,
and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an easy way to summarize the
way people select pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cornell guidelines that guides
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our approach at Beth Page and then
with our larger state park group has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, New York State labeled
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be labeled for use in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the use of the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you how we went about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to introduce some sort of
environmental screening that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's 10 pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different based on their potential
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to screen the products you use
based on this screening model known to
[SPEAKER_00]: many as the environmental impact quotient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I get to a discussion at the
EIQ, I want to give you a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an enormous amount of data
available looking at efficacy of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land-grant institutions have no problem
spraying plots, have no problem telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you what works and doesn't work,
and they do such a good job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can use that information and
translate it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paul Vincelli, a proud Cornell grad at
Kentucky, publishes a particular bulletin
[SPEAKER_00]: every year that ranks efficacy,
looks at fungicide, nematocyte tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and says, these do pretty well in a lot of
different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do poorly in a lot of different
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do good in some, not good in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he ranks the efficacy of the
various products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've put this into a tool to help the
managers make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the EIQ is one you may be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Kovach, a former fruit IPM specialist,
developed this model many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if he could compare organic apple
production to IPM apple production to
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional apple production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the original intent of this
model, that he began to run chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: through to demonstrate one test management
system versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This model is heavily scrutinized by the
scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person published a paper said,
it's no better than random numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will say there are some caveats to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the model was originally developed,
there was a lot of products that were
[SPEAKER_00]: really bad we were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that's
affected its efficacy as a model of
[SPEAKER_00]: screening is a lot of those products are
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wide disparity in potential
environmental impact of a lot of products
[SPEAKER_00]: is more related to their overall amounts
than necessarily their inherent toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model that Joe developed,
Jennifer and I sat down and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we should give these guys a tool at
BethPage to screen these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We adapted this a little bit for our use
and then began to have them use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a table that a turf manager
would get at BethPage for dollar spot
[SPEAKER_00]: control, a sclerotinia minor, that common
disease that killed those greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a variety of products that we know
have decent efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frac code, for those of you that
aren't familiar with these action codes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a HRAC code, an IRAC code.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the frac code, fungicide resistant
action committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically codes them based on their
mode of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to stop using a particular
contact fungicide called chlorothalonil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the concern was, oh,
we're going to get resistance to these
[SPEAKER_00]: other chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, you're going to get
resistance if all you do is spray one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular type of chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use a variety of modes of
action, you're more likely to hold off
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance management continues to be and
is a merging issue in our field as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what they'd have and the
subsequent EIQ numbers that go along with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage them to use reduced risk
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage them, when efficacy was
there, to use OMRI listed products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've used a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at the EIQ of the
various management systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't expect you to grab all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what I want you to do is
compare this one to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is conventional culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is what we were
learning in these other pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, these bio-based ones,
treatment integrity was compromised a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started using them in their
conventional treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were not the best research result,
but a really good behavioral change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, this product works as good as
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's better for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sense is if you give growers options
that they can afford and that work,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely they're going to use those
approaches if it's not a big shift in
[SPEAKER_00]: their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I want you to compare to,
not this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternative culture and IPM versus
conventional culture and conventional pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see the real low EIQ,
which is indicating the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: impact is significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way of looking at the same
data, which culminated in a publication
[SPEAKER_00]: that Bob Portman, so we lost unexpectedly
this past March.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were sorry to lose Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't just lose him from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob passed away suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a big shock to our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was his master's work and a
longtime colleague with mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we got that data, we hired Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, hey, we learned this stuff on
the green course.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we take it to the whole state
park system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply the same thinking and started to
look at our EIQ for our pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: programs and compare them to different
golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were collecting pest management
programs, pesticide use records from
[SPEAKER_00]: around the country, comparing what some
golf courses are doing compared to what
[SPEAKER_00]: our flagship golf course, the tournament
golf course, was doing and the average
[SPEAKER_00]: state golf courses were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we were starting to
establish a basis baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the University of Wisconsin has taken
this and they're creating a statewide
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative of all their golf courses to be
at or below an average EIQ value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things you notice,
these are various parts of the golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course, small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this represents about three acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about four acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairways generally can be 20 to 30 acres
of turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough areas, 40 to 60 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you apply pesticides to larger
areas, the larger your EIQ goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been still comfortable using the
EIQ because while it's a measure of
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity of the material, risk is a
function of toxicity and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the toxicity of the
product and the exposure that a golfer or
[SPEAKER_00]: the citizens might have by deploying these
compounds on a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look, so now you're looking at
seven years, one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six years of data we've collected
from 15 state park golf courses that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been participating in the expanded program
since 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the total environmental impact
of their pesticide use over that period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see when we started the
program, this was the year before we
[SPEAKER_00]: started, we started the program,
we said, hey, use this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray less compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the EIQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, right away, we saw big
reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I break this out into all the golf
courses, all 15 courses, only the five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six on Long Island, no, seven on Long
Island, and then eight upstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seven and eight golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly the same number of golf
courses, but you see the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide use is occurring on Long Island
golf courses, on Long Island golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they immediately began to drop their
EIQ, and they got pest problems like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we started to take this out to a
broader audience, they were going through
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing we went through when we
started 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I think we've seen is sort of a
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: We watched a big increase for a couple of
years, and Jennifer Grant and I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: very closely on training and trying to
figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the last few years, we've
implemented a strategy that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave you with as I wrap up what we've
learned in these last few years about
[SPEAKER_00]: really changing pest management behavior
using this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this data allows us to do,
and what Bob really left us this great
[SPEAKER_00]: gift, is this enormous database that
allows us to look at their behavior based
[SPEAKER_00]: on environmental impact of the products
that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took the field use EIQ, which is the
toxicity of the material calibrated for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate, multiplied by the area treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that a majority of increases
across, this is all 15 golf courses,
[SPEAKER_00]: came from large increases to rough areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed control was the primary product
that's driving a lot of this, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: additional fungicide treatments that are
getting made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once people see a really good golf
course, they want to keep playing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you give them a perfect apple,
they want a perfect apple all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sort of were a victim of our own
success that we got good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at it and we watched their
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, wait a minute, we're going to
start to stop this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to make some changes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see fairway use, which was high,
has gotten bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting green use has stayed fairly
flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it got very interesting and
where we've really implemented the
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we want you to stop using
products that are very high toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it represented in 2015, about 50% of
the products they were still using,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would call bad actors or EIQs above a
value that we liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to see a decline in their
use, but boy, that use went up quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, even above where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the education's been focused
most recently, and that is two pest
[SPEAKER_00]: problems on these golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That about 50%, 48% of all the pesticide
used on these 15 golf courses went at
[SPEAKER_00]: these two pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this EIQ data allowed us
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing this, we tried to
implement some training, which included
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of predictive models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skip B over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of predictive models that was
saying that we've been working with our D
[SPEAKER_00]: guys at the Northeast Climate Center,
we had these predictive models available
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started using these models a long
time ago and developed risks that could
[SPEAKER_00]: predict when this disease would be a
particular problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked the practitioners to monitor
that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you have these dots in low,
medium, and high risk put out in indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is below this is low risk,
medium risk for disease, high risk for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the trace of the risk that was
experienced at BethPage in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there was about a 12 to 14
day period when risks were very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we want to reserve those high
risk control products for only those times
[SPEAKER_00]: and use softer products or products with
lower EIQ values during periods of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: risk if they're needed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we began this in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave them some suggestions for looking at
a model, what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually looked at their chemical
applications during that period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and found when you look at their EIQ
values, that one, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at some of their highest
EIQ values, they're following when some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressures were the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to see that by bringing
a lot of different ways of thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management to bear for these people,
they're starting to adjust their
[SPEAKER_00]: management to be more in line with when
the risk occurs, how to use these lower
[SPEAKER_00]: EIQ products, and how the result in the
end is going to be less environmental risk
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy Wilson is our project manager and
deserves all the credit in the world for
[SPEAKER_00]: putting up with me all these years of
visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down on Long Island from April to
November every other week for the better
[SPEAKER_00]: part of seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the most recent Barclays
tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shifted some of our work to enhance
pollinator habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The project continues to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get $100,000 every year from state
parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've started to plant some of these
out of way areas now into places where
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators have some more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, our most recent extension
accomplishment was publishing this New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State best management practices for
golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is primarily for water quality
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the EIQ and the things that we've
learned from our project are embedded in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm right at my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish I had time for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe take one or two quick questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have two questions on approaches that
you consider or do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one was trigeminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other is, are there known
suppressive soils to the tumble diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: you're interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And could you use a microbiome transplant
type of approach to try to enhance control
[SPEAKER_00]: of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer to your first question,
did we use trichoderma?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue to use the trichoderma
product down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked very well on a number of root
pathogen problems that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as suppressive soils, no such luck
there, Janice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Eric Nelson early on in his career
was working on that particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we found some things with pythium
that might be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think anybody's taking that
work any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's something that the
microbiome is, Jenny's working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be a future for that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't found any suppressive soils
that we can characterize that exist
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody have a last question?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, let's thank Frank, everyone.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
