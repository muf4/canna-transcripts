[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pleasure to share with you for the
first time part of my research work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of my talk is identifying
potential atherotic group in Nigeria
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava using data from ITA breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava, my favorite crop, belongs to the
family of ephobiasias, that is flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is predominantly classified as an
art-crossing species despite having both
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a plenally propagated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava is extremely heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this heterogeneity nature of
this crop, to improve the performance of
[SPEAKER_00]: population cross is always a big challenge
in identifying the optimal palatal
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One possible way to address this obstacle
is to use reciprocal recurrent selection
[SPEAKER_00]: through which you can identify two
atherotic groups to optimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: performances of the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three main objectives of this
study to estimate additive and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-additive genetic variants and assess
their predictive ability in genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result from this objective will be
used to simulate progeny from palatal
[SPEAKER_00]: combination, knowing very well that to
evaluate thousands of progeny from a pair
[SPEAKER_00]: of cross is always impractical in the feed
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is need for us to do simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the simulation, we are going
to use the result to predict genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: merits of parents toward identifying
atherotic group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the general concept of the
whole study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to have two population,
the training population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will consist of historical data
from next-gen project in ITA breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to use those historical
data to predict the performances of the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny simulated from the candidate
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the candidate population, we have to
start by identifying existing germplasm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we are going to simulate
half-dialel among the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to simulate 100 progeny
per family, and we are going to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: their performances by using the historical
data from the training populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the main performances of those
progeny and their genetic similarity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to classify them into two
atherotic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is NEON?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have started to pull a number of
trials together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a total number of 38 trials
across different evaluation stages,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone evaluation, preliminary year trial,
advanced year trial, and uniform year
[SPEAKER_00]: trial across two locations, Ibarra and
Ikenne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a total number of 7,342 data
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have SNP data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's need for that in order to
capture the segregation among individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: within the same family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after doing all the quality checks,
so we end up having training population
[SPEAKER_00]: size of 684 samples by 12,317 sleep
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do all sorts of analysis using
different kinds of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of them is somalibri in R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with, the traditional practice
for you to analyze data is to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: exploratory analysis to have idea of what
your data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the bus plot and histogram
showing the distribution of fresh fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the data seem to
approximate normal distributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: except that of clone evaluation,
which is a little bit skewed to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the point, which is the
mean, is a little bit higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: median.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the SNP data, you know it's always
characterized with error noise value due
[SPEAKER_00]: to how that data is sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the pipeline we follow to get
rid of error noise values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fitter based on site missingness,
mannerly frequency, fitter load depth
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, mean depth sites, and the
threshold I use is the one in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after fittering the data, so we have to
impose this clean data using Begu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also use Blink to convert it to
dosage formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's need to have APMA formats so
that we can use that to get the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the detail of how we went about
cleaning the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava being a deep blood organism,
the SNP data is biallelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the frequency of the first
allele, frequency of the second allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use just a manner, we fitter for
mannerly frequency using 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the site missingness, we use threshold
of 10% so that those sites that have 10
[SPEAKER_00]: and above across the sample should be
removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, we did the same thing for the
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a threshold of 10% so that those
samples that have 10% and above missing
[SPEAKER_00]: data across the sites should be removed,
should be excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the site depth, the depth here is the
number of sequencers per site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use threshold of 10 or 100 so that
those samples between 10 or 100 should be
[SPEAKER_00]: retained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those below 10, those are the sites
with low sequence error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some sites that have high
depth due to probably repeat region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those ones are also eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are interested in this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after all these fittering criteria,
so we end up having 962 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 12,317 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having got the clean SNP data,
so I use SOMA library in R because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: the kernel to extract the genomic
relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the formula adapted from NDelMA
2011 and Faraday 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, so the question is,
from these three components of epistasis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones will I use in my models?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to come up with these correlation
matrices by extracting up diagonal
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, additive by additive is
less, has the least covariance with
[SPEAKER_00]: additive and dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may have you, why do you have to use
additive by additive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that cassava is an out-crossing
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike a separate crop like wheat,
where additive by additive is well
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk more on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with the analysis of the data,
I use two-stage approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first approach is to analyze the
phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the kernel evaluation trial,
this is the model I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kernel evaluation trial is early stage
of breeding program where we have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: lines to evaluate it because of
insufficient planting materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to use checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chests have to be replicated in every
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the other evaluation stages,
we have enough planting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we normally use randomized complete dot
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the border fitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where the genotypes are taken to be
random to estimate the genotypic variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the G-prop model fitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this is the fresh seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the intercept part of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is additive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same thing for the, so we use this
as the baseline model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other multiple kernel models,
in addition to additive effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have dominance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have epistatic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dominance and epistatic effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is studentized residual from the
phenotypic data, which is a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics to detect an outlayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the variance component
estimated from those different evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see that the residual variance
keep declining from early stage to later
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because at late stage of
breeding, we have, it's a kind of a trial
[SPEAKER_00]: with a large plus size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you fitted those G-prop models?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field statistics reveal that the
model which incorporate additive dominance
[SPEAKER_00]: and epistatic seem to give the best
prediction abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, and this is
histogram showing the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: those predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the, I tried to partition the
total variance, total genetic variance
[SPEAKER_00]: into different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, the dominance and
epistatic seem to contribute a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meaning that we cannot ignore the
importance of non-dominance effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that the model that has
additive and non-additive is likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you good prediction for genetic
merits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lesson learned from this lesson is
that the model that include additive and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-additive effect predicts genetic
merits accurately, and the dominance
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is not completely independent of
additive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meaning that they overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dominance effect seem to play a major
role in flushing threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future work is to consult with IT
research team to assemble the candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: pools from which we have to, from which
the authority group will be defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still need to explore other genomic
prediction method to compare the result
[SPEAKER_00]: with the existing ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to simulate a probability of 100
progeny for each pair of parental
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give special thanks to my special
committees for their support.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the advice from time to time to all
the member of John Luke group,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends for advice in one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Melinda Bill Gates, UK Hage for
the financial support toward the research
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried fitting these models?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do the additive fit, and then you
add a dominance kernel, and then you add
[SPEAKER_01]: an epistatic kernel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you actually tried to fit just a
dominance or just an epistatic and compare
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the additive itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, so you have this thing
where you're doing like a nested,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start with an additive only,
then you have an additive plus dominance,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have additive plus dominance plus
epistasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, have you tried to fit
just dominance or just epistasis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my experience that you end up
with really similar prediction,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in an inbred, by modeling only
epistasis, I could end up with really
[SPEAKER_01]: similar prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I tried to do is,
I did that early this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of using the additive by
additive as epistatic components,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to use additive by dominance to
see what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I observed is that the process
irritability is much higher, around 0.67.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I look at the prediction
accuracy, it's almost the same thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: that of additive by additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's because there's a big scale
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
