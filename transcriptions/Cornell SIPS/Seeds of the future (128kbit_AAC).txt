[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Lisa, for organizing
my second visit to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember when the first visit
was, which is a consequence of my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember this room, so I gave the
same seminar in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why Seeds of Future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we have in front of us all
these problems, water, poverty,
[SPEAKER_00]: hunger, malnutrition, biodiversity,
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the problem is becoming six
because problems such as obesity and
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes are becoming epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps because of professional
deformation, I tend to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is related to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about seed,
we are not talking about only planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting, farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually talking about food,
because all our food is coming from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: directly or indirectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our health depends largely on what we
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about seed has much bigger
implication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed is related to water because
agriculture is using 70% of global water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The country where I live now is using,
well, 36% of that is 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this water goes to three crops,
rice, wheat, and maize, which are using
[SPEAKER_00]: globally nearly 50% of the total water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other two crops are using another 20%,
even though they're grown only on 2% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed is related to poverty because
recently has been shown that infant
[SPEAKER_00]: malnutrition, in the first 1,000 days,
brings to mental retardation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is associated with poverty because
these children will be taken out of school
[SPEAKER_00]: early, will not perform very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As adults, will not have access to a
well-paid job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not feed their children
properly, and this would be a vicious
[SPEAKER_00]: circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunger and malnutrition, you know that now
we are in the absolute situation in which
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are overweight and obese
are nearly more than those who tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: will go to bed without having enough food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, overweight,
obesity, diabetes, and most recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: nonalcoholic fatty liver are becoming
widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to give you an idea of the
incredible increase in overweight and
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity in the last 10 years, particularly
in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the number of people overweight and
obese went from less than a billion to
[SPEAKER_00]: more than two billions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, the number of
fitness centers has gone up by 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And selling equipment to lose that fat is
becoming a very big business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diabetes, if we pull all the people
affected by diabetes in one country,
[SPEAKER_00]: that country will be the third most
populated country in the world after China
[SPEAKER_00]: and India and just before US.
[SPEAKER_00]: The probability of dying by diabetes is
almost doubled in the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been projected globally that
there will be an increase in diabetes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 15 years, basically in all age
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in sub-Saharan Africa,
with the increase in urbanization and the
[SPEAKER_00]: increased use of processed food,
it's projected an increase in all the what
[SPEAKER_00]: are called modern diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunger and malnutrition are increasingly
being seen as a problem of accessibility
[SPEAKER_00]: and availability rather than a problem of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we are already throwing in
the garbage bins 30% of our agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, people in the north is much
better off because throwing about 10 times
[SPEAKER_00]: more food in the garbage bin than the
people in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change, many things have been said
about climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things which are not said
often enough is that, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody has got any idea of how much hotter
I hope we'll be able to be a bit hotter in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca next time I come, or how much drier
is going to be the climate in 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you look at the two major,
well, the color has changed, but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the two major models, the Australian on
top and the American on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference in color,
which is better here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is major differences in prediction
with the Australian model being a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in case of a rainfall is the American
model being a little bit more optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see big differences in prediction
in Western Amazonia and Sub-Saharan
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, from a breeding point of
view, climate change is likely to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: moving target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly what to shoot for
and most probably, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different target in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody is today able to tell this
farmer in Yemen or these farmers in Uganda
[SPEAKER_00]: what will be the climate that they will
have to cope with in 20 years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because when you go
to a supermarket, keep in mind that that
[SPEAKER_00]: food is only produced by 30% of all the
agricultural activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of the world food is actually produced
by those guys that you've seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, even FAO has recognized this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing which just came out
recently is that one of the expected
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the CO2 increase in the
atmosphere is a decline of the content of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and zinc in C3 crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's serious because there are
already 63 million people dying because of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron and zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do our crop are already being affected by
climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is this set of data,
very impressive, 2.5 million data from
[SPEAKER_00]: about 40, nearly 50 years period,
where they classify the area that's
[SPEAKER_00]: planted with maize, wheat, rice,
and soybean globally as areas where the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop never, the yield never improved or is
stagnating or is collapsing or is still
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybean, nearly 25% of the area yield
never improved or are stagnating or are
[SPEAKER_00]: collapsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize, nearly 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice, nearly 38%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, the green revolution crop,
nearly 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these four crops, between 24 and 39%
of the area which is planted, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: yields either never improved or are
collapsing or are decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptation to climate change is becoming a
major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, plants have an
extraordinary ability to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling the PhD student during lunch
that probably they are too young to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 450 million years ago, the first
plants did not have leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at that time, the CO2 content of
the atmosphere was 15 times higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, there was no need of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few stomata on the same would be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then between 400 and 350 million years
ago, the CO2 content started going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took 50 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about this complex
structure, and this was only because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was enough diversity to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a further demonstration,
there were samples of leaves of these five
[SPEAKER_00]: tree species collected at the time of
Darwin at about 1820, 1840, and kept in
[SPEAKER_00]: the herbarium of the Department of Botany
at the University of Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were sampled again in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the decline in the frequency
of stomata as a response to the increase
[SPEAKER_00]: of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity is pretty much at the center
of discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you see this is a classroom in a
university in Iran, where I go often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they often invite me to give lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these students added to the banner,
biodiversity is our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a global recognition that is
essential to secure global food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reduction of biodiversity has been
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody agrees on these figures of
75% of diversity of agricultural crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have been lost, the same for the
fisheries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an estimate that if the
temperature goes up more than 3.5 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of the species will not pick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here, I think that there is a big
contradiction in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on one side, many of the top
scientific journals are publishing often
[SPEAKER_00]: these papers warning about the danger in
the decline of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side, the science which
is producing the seed that most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are planting has gone almost
exclusively in the last 40 years towards
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these is again associated with
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these tendency of plant breeding
towards uniformity has of course caused an
[SPEAKER_00]: increased uniformity in the food that we
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we eat increasingly uniform food,
why we should have this big diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor of our intestine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper think that they found the
trend between the decline of biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: in our gut with increased frequency of
diseases with an inflammatory base like
[SPEAKER_00]: asthma and several types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the uniformity of food is also
associated with the fact that most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: food is basically produced by these
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you sure that you are the one
deciding what you are going to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long will it take to have this
extraordinary extra light Coca-Cola?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this uniformity dominated
agriculture, which is basically where the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market is dominated by very few
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the same companies are also
controlling the global pesticide market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically a lot of money because
most markets are worth billions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now concerning pesticide, there was
recently a conference of medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm quoting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that out of the 12 most dangerous
chemicals, nine are pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mostly affecting children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are inevitable because a famous
entomologist, Pimentel, is quoting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of data indicating that most of the pests
have got natural enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So resistance and each insect pest has as
many as 10, 15 natural enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we go back to the issue that
also pesticides very often end up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: food chain and end up in our plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the solution then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, GMO crops, in my opinion,
cannot be the solution because they ignore
[SPEAKER_00]: the fundamental theorem of natural
selection, which says this for PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: students should be accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many others, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically predicting the rate of
change as a ratio between the variance for
[SPEAKER_00]: additive genetic fitness and the means
fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: In simpler terms, it says that when the
environment surrounding a living organism
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, that living organism evolve to
get adjusted to the new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the speed of this adaptation depends
on the amount of additive genetic variance
[SPEAKER_00]: for fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the example of cotton in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004, farmers started describing the
fast resistant weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, 92% of the farmers in Georgia had
to hand weed half of their cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is happening with all GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sooner or later, because and this is
equivalent to, you remember the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion about horizontal and vertical
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same mechanism of vertical
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ends up by selecting an organism which is
able to overcome that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the terminology of Robinson,
the vertical resistance and GMOs are
[SPEAKER_00]: within the evolutionary ability of the
organism to overcome that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why horizontal resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will see now mixtures are beyond
that evolutionary potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happened basically everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the best of the hypothesis,
they can be a quick fix, which is only
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary and which is likely to create
another problem, which requires another
[SPEAKER_00]: GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I discuss this idea in this paper,
which took quite a while to be accepted,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the criticism was that I did not
consider the second generation GMO crops
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistant to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you look at the literature,
weeds have already developed resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple resistance to more than one
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several species with combined
resistance to more herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you see this extraordinary
success of GMOs in US, but you also see
[SPEAKER_00]: the monopoly of the seed market,
you wonder whether it's a problem of,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it actually a commercial success or is
it a problem of choice of seed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of pesticides has not gone down
with very few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are data from projection from USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, there's been a substantial
increase in the number and volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic agriculture can be a solution
because it minimizes soil erosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces water loss, uses organic
fertilizer, use crop rotation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most importantly, it promotes evenness
among enemies so that organic agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't put any pressure on the organism
with certain diseases to evolve because it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows them to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, in organic agriculture,
you always have a little bit of damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem is that yields are
generally lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been four meta-analyses
published in the last five, six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that all these
comparisons are biased by the fact that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are comparing varieties which have been
bred for conventional agriculture and we
[SPEAKER_00]: plant them under organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how did we go from these diversity,
which was available until even in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and is still available in some
countries, to these uniformity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at the evolution of
plant breeding, four millennia was done in
[SPEAKER_00]: a very different way from what we do today
by farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, farmers were selecting for
specific adaptation to their own
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, because each one was
selecting different things, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was diversity both between and
within land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these resulted in resilience,
both at the farmer level and the global
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with the beginning of scientific
plant breeding, the major change was from
[SPEAKER_00]: selection for specific adaptation to
selection for wild adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these found this best expression in
the Green Revolution, which was a term
[SPEAKER_00]: which was used by the then-director of the
USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a technology based on the concept
of a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a variety, irrigation, fertilizer,
pesticide, and mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a resuscitation and you are
addressing a multitude of different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, a very smart way of solving
the problem is that you put fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put irrigation, you put fertilizer and
irrigation, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make all this environment as
similar as possible so that the same
[SPEAKER_00]: variety can fit in all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, if you think about,
because of this package, Green Revolution
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time privileged food security over
food safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, what happened was that there
was an increase in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy level remained constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a decline in protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about global food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a decline in iron and decline in
zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that now, we have to eat 4%,
23%, and 6% more cereals to satisfy the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily requirement in protein, iron,
and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what then we can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: If this has been partially associated with
the way in which we are doing plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, how can we change plant breeding
to make things different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm talking about plant breeding in
general and not selection in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we are talking about
molecular breeding and genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not affecting the efficiency of a
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's affecting the precision in which
we are doing selection, which is one stage
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how efficient is this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, usually, particularly public
institutions are measuring the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of response to selection and in
terms of number of varieties released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I've been suggesting is that the
response to selection should be weighted
[SPEAKER_00]: against time, because different methods
are different in timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one should consider the number of
varieties adopted rather than the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of variety released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one should consider also other
elements, such as the cost-benefit ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: and the increase of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fundamental problem in plant breeding
is the relationship between selection
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and target environment,
which usually in form of plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: are different, except in Australia,
where most of the breeding programs take
[SPEAKER_00]: place in the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that the response to selection
depends on irritability, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: irritability, you all know this formula,
is depending on genotype environment
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction and environmental variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take care of these with good
experimental design and statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remembering that G by E is made up of
genotype by location, genotype by years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and genotype by location by years,
if we set up our program in such a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can distinguish between genotype
by location and genotype by years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found that the genotype by location
is repeatable, then we can split our
[SPEAKER_00]: population of target environment in
subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In such a way that within each group,
the variance due to genotype by location
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction is less, therefore
irritability is higher, and the response
[SPEAKER_00]: to selection is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is this formula really useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's actually measuring the
response to selection in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are making selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't want to do varieties for the
resuscitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do varieties for the outside
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we should use is actually a
formula of correlated response to
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the selection here, and I measure it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this introduced the genetic
correlation coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the major contribution of
Falconer when he said that the same trait
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring two different environments
should be dealt with as two different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because despite of the relationship
between irritability, it all depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic correlation coefficient,
which is always less than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way of increasing these is to make
the selection environment and the target
[SPEAKER_00]: environment as similar as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you do that by selecting the
target environments, making a selection
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and target environment the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what farmers have already
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been selecting their own
environments when they selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is also the basic principle of
participatory plant breeding, that you do
[SPEAKER_00]: selection in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we call decentralization,
which is expected to increase response to
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, but which is usually met with a
lot of resistance by many scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much more comfortable to work
within the resuscitation than to go
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this resistance is
justified by saying, well, at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of a breeding program,
we have a lot of lines, very little seed
[SPEAKER_00]: of each line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prefer to do a lot of replication of
station, and therefore we have no seed
[SPEAKER_00]: left to work outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, the tendency is actually to do
less replication and use that seed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more location by using new experimental
design, like the partially replicated
[SPEAKER_00]: design, randomized with optimized
randomization, and using row and column
[SPEAKER_00]: design and spatial analysis to increase
the precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then you can use the little seed
that you have to do less replication and
[SPEAKER_00]: use the extra seed to actually add more
location right at the beginning of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other reason that they often say,
but resuscitation are so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: precise, are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture I took a few days ago in
the campus of ICRISAT, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: international centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decentralization per se will not increase
adoption, because adoption is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex decision that the farmers have to
take, is difficult to predict,
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on gender, crop, environment,
and is difficult to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's much more easy to measure
the number of varieties released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make a breeding program more
efficient, one can think about combining
[SPEAKER_00]: the decentralization and farmer
participation, because decentralization
[SPEAKER_00]: increase heritability and therefore
response to selection, and the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: participation increase adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I've been trying to do
starting in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, the first idea came from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know a guy by the name of Herbert
Weber, who in 1908 published this paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan Breeding for Farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And without knowing it, I published this
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only difference is that there is a
width instead of a form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if this is a breeding program,
where you have generally crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but other methods of including genetic
material, this new genetic material
[SPEAKER_00]: includes also material coming from genomic
selection and marker assisted selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you will see in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main aspect of this is that most of
this work is done on station.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some countries, these steps in the
farmer's field is necessary for the
[SPEAKER_00]: registration of varieties, and all the
decisions are taken by the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in a participatory breeding program,
the difference, I mean, the stages are
[SPEAKER_00]: still the same, but many more stages takes
place in farmer's field, and the decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: are shared with the farmer's community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a form of participation,
which is known as participatory variety
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, where the difference is that
the stage where the farm, the material
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out of the farm of the cessation is
delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the problem is that the farmers
have much less choice to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a conventional breeding program,
you have the hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses segregated in population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then selection and a few lines,
and then the lines get a name and get
[SPEAKER_00]: registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start the production of
certified seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, only then, a farmer have a
possibility of deciding whether all this
[SPEAKER_00]: work was actually useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many developing countries,
all these names of variety release are
[SPEAKER_00]: basically names in the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in participatory breeding,
you start from the same starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done by the scientists of station,
creating all this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the diversity goes in farmer's
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be pure lines, population clones,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers evaluate the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is as inclusive as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major difference is that because
the farmers are living with the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start expressing initial adoption
during the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start multiplying the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does not exclude going to the
official channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what happened is that it
changes the relationship between adoption
[SPEAKER_00]: and release.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in the conventional, you first
release, and then perhaps you get
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you start getting adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you release what has been already
partially adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientific is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that there is this transfer of
material from station to farmer's field,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sharing of decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other aspect is that you can
replicate all these in as many villages as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I was working for about 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the blue are the registration
of the ministry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red color are the villages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main difference here is that each
village is considered to be as an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent selection site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we select in that village regardless of
how the material performed in other
[SPEAKER_00]: villages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we go from an initial
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the program in Syria,
which was the largest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 200 plots with 160 types of
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers do the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is selected goes in stage two,
which is, of course, less entries,
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated trials, bigger plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process continues until in stage
four, you start to already having half an
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each year, there is a new stage
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the program is fully implemented
in a village, you can find trials in stage
[SPEAKER_00]: one, stage two, stage three, stage four.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very demanding for some
countries and some national programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a simplified version where a
new cycle starts at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous cycle so that this is more
manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each stage, the farmers are
evaluating the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a number of measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are analyzed using those methods
that I said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers are using this data to
decide what goes from one stage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done in a number of places,
different environment, different social
[SPEAKER_00]: context, irrigated and non-irrigated
recently under organic conditions in
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy, and with a number of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both cross-pollinated and self-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic assisted breeding is fully
compatible with participatory program
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a recent figure published by Rajiv
and Susan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see, here there is all the
different genomics method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to draw your attention on
the last bit of this figure, which says
[SPEAKER_00]: identify and recombine superior genotypes,
multi-environment testing, and improve
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering who identifies where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Superior where for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-environment testing, you know,
is the bread and butter of any breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who are the best lines which goes into
the multi-environment testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I think participatory
program breeding can be combined in a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular breeding program to make sure
that all this work is then translated in
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the farmers may not see
anything coming out of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now moving from conventional to
participatory for some breeders is
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it's a very dangerous thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it's full of sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some, you see the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a weak point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weak point is that because of this
need of collaboration between institution
[SPEAKER_00]: and farmers, what I found is that the
attitude of institution and scientists is
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes negative, sometimes
unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even worse is mutable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tell the story of rise and fall
of participatory breeding in Kermanshah in
[SPEAKER_00]: Iran, which is a country where I started
this work back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kermanshah is this place down here,
much closer to Baghdad than to Tehran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Roentgen, who was at that time the
director of the provincial offices,
[SPEAKER_00]: was absolutely enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he participated in the first meetings
in the mosque.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very quickly, the program spread
throughout all the province.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he started calling his colleagues in
other provinces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started spreading outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one day, I arrived in Tehran in
the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Khatija Razawi was waiting for me
at the airport and told me, Salvatore,
[SPEAKER_00]: bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Roentgen has been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been told that you are not
welcome in that province.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program was ended from one day to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program is still continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we are expanding to rise and to
maze, to rise in the north and to maze in
[SPEAKER_00]: the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, this was a sort of warning
signal that if the research institute
[SPEAKER_00]: stops supporting the program, then what
will be the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the future, we thought, was to combine
participation with evolution, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: without inventing anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all published in 1956 by
Coates-Hanneson, an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary-prohibiting method,
but was based on work done in Davis,
[SPEAKER_00]: California by Harlan and by Robert
Hallard, and basically consists in making
[SPEAKER_00]: big mixtures, as big as you can,
possibly with segregating population,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with fixed material, and let this
material, these populations, evolve in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area which are your target environment,
which could be many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is that you plant and
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this process, because of the
crosses, which also in a cell-pointed crop
[SPEAKER_00]: always happen, the seed that you harvest
is never the seed that you planted,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the population is evolving and is
evolving, adapting to all changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: including those climate changes without
necessarily knowing now what the climate
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be, because it's got all the
time to slowly adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we do, we are using the
fundamental theorem of natural selection
[SPEAKER_00]: to our own advantage, exploiting the
evolutionary capability of our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also use these populations to
select a material for the participatory
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with a huge population of
barley when I was still in Syria,
[SPEAKER_00]: with 1,600 F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the following year, we made one
of dune wheat and bread wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this went to many countries,
one of which was Iran, where this
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology ran me into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because originally, evolutionary was
translated into revolutionary,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not the right word to use in that
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it spread to many provinces.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some pictures in different
villages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the province in which I cannot
travel, but the evolutionary population
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is bread wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been made locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is going on also in Jordan and
in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ethiopia, the population has been made
with locally adapted material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have rice in Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have maize in Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have rice in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, there is some work here in
Washington state on mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this material went to Italy through
the Italian Association for Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and spread throughout most of
the regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some local institutions started using
it for some squash, tomato, maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: and beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are other pictures about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened very often is that,
like in this case, they used this idea to
[SPEAKER_00]: make their own local evolutionary
population with locally adapted material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually was done by inter-crossing
11 commercial hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that basically a farmer
can do by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the market by different hybrids,
mix them in a salad bowl, plant the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what he gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the farmers start using
these as a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process is that while the
population is evolving, at intervals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the farmers and the scientists can
decide, they can select and get new
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we've done already in Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are head rows coming from these
individual spike selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the farmers, it's like having a
gene bank in their hand, a gene bank which
[SPEAKER_00]: is evolving with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are usually advised to store the
seed every year so that in case of a major
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster, they don't lose all the past
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, going back to the question,
if the Results Institute stops providing
[SPEAKER_00]: technical backstopping to the program,
then the place is replaced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is fully in the hands of the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Iranian farmers who always
like to do something new, I found that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were actually using a locally made
evolutionary population of bread wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less complex, about 100
varieties, to start making bread with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some initial difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, particularly, this group of
women, they made up a small company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this bread is becoming a major
commercial success in a number of villages
[SPEAKER_00]: because they discover it has curative
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be eaten even by people allergic to
gluten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there is this lady who is running
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met her for the first time last
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was telling me that demand for
this bread is so high that very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: she doesn't have enough supply to satisfy
the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now doing the same so that in the
case of Iran, what we found was not only
[SPEAKER_00]: that these populations have higher yields,
better wheat control, and better control
[SPEAKER_00]: of diseases, but actually, they become a
crop which produce a product which is
[SPEAKER_00]: economically profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing this now in a number of
countries, including Italy, where I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sister-in-law who is allergic to gluten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's baking her own bread with this
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's making all sorts of different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is quite a lot of evidence that
evolutionary population actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some arguments against,
one of which is that under harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, even though there is a strong
selection pressure, the irritability may
[SPEAKER_00]: be too low for evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under good conditions, there is a high
irritability, but there is low selection
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another argument is by Denison,
the author of this book, Darwinian
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that natural selection has got
10,000 years to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to check out things,
so what you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both objections prove to be not
correct by a lot of scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is historical data on the evolution
of powdery-meat resistance in composite
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work done in Davis, California,
with different types of mixtures,
[SPEAKER_00]: double applied lines and composite cross,
with the composite cross evolving much
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, particularly within the region of
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixtures of rice, a variety of rice
planted in alternate strips, which control
[SPEAKER_00]: blast much better than the monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works also in crop, self-pollinated
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this classical experiment by
Moran with a nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this nematode is basically equivalent
to a self-pollinated crop because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: made of hermaphrodite, and mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the reproduction is by
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically a self-pollinated crop
with about 5% out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did, they changed the mating
system by mutation, inducing 100% crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: and another percent selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put all this material under the
pressure of a violent bacterial pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: for 40 generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found is that the 100%
selfing did not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 100% crossing made it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But surprisingly, the wild type with just
5% out-crossing was able to mate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the frequency of out-crossing
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this experiment by a German
scientist on Lentil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made this evolving these populations in
different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found significant differences for
things like seed yield, seed weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and beginning of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Italy, we have this population evolving
in two contrasting regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, it's only one year
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the two in both locations plus
one farmer selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that in Tuscany,
the material evolving in that region and
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer selection were much better than
the one evolving in Sicily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Sicily, it was just the other way
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about four years of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the change is rather quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per millimetre in Niger, there's been an
increase in drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the 200-millimetre
isolator was at 17 degrees latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone down now to nearly 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, the size of these
circles is proportional to the earlyness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there has been an
increase in small circle in this period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar data are coming from Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They compare the wild wheat and wild
barley from 10 different populations each
[SPEAKER_00]: collected in 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the green bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 28 years later, in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, in all cases, there is a
significant increase in earlyness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to me that if they want,
institutions can do plant breeding in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way, and addressing some major
global issues, even working at individual
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if hunger is not a problem of
production, but a problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility, by working at this level,
you can increase the amount of food
[SPEAKER_00]: straight in the hands of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an effect in biodiversity because
being decentralized and based on specific
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation, of course, it select varieties
which different from country to country,
[SPEAKER_00]: from village to village, and very often,
depending on the wealth and other
[SPEAKER_00]: differences from farmer to farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Syria, in the period where
we monitor the adoption, you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon by which, given in 2007,
you have these varieties being adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other varieties start being produced in
2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other, again, in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, by 2010, those adopted in 2007
disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process is extremely dynamic,
creating a situation which, for diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: and insects, is basically out of reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an idea of the diversity in
this material at molecular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with the evolutionary component,
it becomes a powerful mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation to climate changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is particularly fit for organic
conditions because it doesn't require any
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering that when we're talking
about climate change, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation strategies and adaptation
strategies, by combining organic
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and the evolutionary plant
breeding, you actually have a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mitigation effect of organic
agriculture and the adaptation effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, instead of having one
solution for all the environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: we changed the philosophy in having
different solutions for different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in evolutionary plant breeding,
therefore, it not only brings back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers the control of seed, decreases the
crop vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dynamic way of adapting crops to
climate changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, these
populations are not patentable because
[SPEAKER_00]: they change all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had a discussion with a few people
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me that the major weakness
of GMOs is that being a quick fix,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not a stable solution because
they actually put a pressure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: organism, and it evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I express this concern in public,
then the pro-GMOs tell me, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the same thing as vertical
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why a lot of pathologists have
been suggesting to breed for vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, which is much more difficult,
but it's much more durable and doesn't put
[SPEAKER_00]: any pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is exactly what evolutionary
population do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an evolutionary population,
you always find a little bit of a disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: some attacks from the insect, but it's
never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you should see the incredible
efficiency of mixtures in suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen farmers becoming organic not
because it was a choice, a philosophical
[SPEAKER_00]: choice, because there's no need of using
any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are not enough diseases,
insect damage, or weeds to justify any
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contrary to the GMOs, the evolutionary
population, actually, they get better with
[SPEAKER_00]: time, while the GMOs are beautiful in the
first two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a new race or a new weed is
coming, basically, you need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: another GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolutionary population do exactly the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get better with time because they get
better and better adapted to that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alternative to the GMOs will be the
evolutionary population.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, the seed is fully in the hands of
the farmer, and it does not have to depend
[SPEAKER_00]: on anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you think about, and I'm passing
this message also to International Center,
[SPEAKER_00]: there could be nobody who can give you a
better material than material which has
[SPEAKER_00]: been evolving for 10 years in your field
and the new way of practicing agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, and because there is
no major plant breeding efforts going
[SPEAKER_00]: towards organic agriculture, you put one
of these populations under organic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, and they bet that if you are
using the selection from that field in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to varieties under
conventional, then the comparison between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's more or less like saying the
difference in reaction among scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: towards this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a farmer in Iran was asked
exactly the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel investing a piece of land
which is basically unproductive just to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep this population evolving?
[SPEAKER_00]: And his answer was, but this is an
investment in my future and the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have one farmer in that
community spreading that message,
[SPEAKER_00]: that message will go across the community
much more effectively than if you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I do, during lunch I was
discussing the very first beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: this work in Syria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now what I do when I go to a new
place, like a new village in Iran,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never go there and say, I come here with
a new solution to your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually go there and say, well,
I've been invited to this place to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what I'm doing in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try through this method to generate
the interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, OK, if other farmers are doing it,
why not us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they asked me about the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you may have different solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you have a situation like
Ethiopia, even more Eritrea, with very
[SPEAKER_00]: small farm size, then you have to design
the experiments involved in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, using incomplete block
design, where you're giving each farmer an
[SPEAKER_00]: incomplete block rather than the entire
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it basically ends up growing five
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you play also with the size of the
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Syria, there was not a major
problem with land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Jordan, we had farmers going from half
an hectare to 200 hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the half an hectare did not have enough
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 200 hectares guy told us, I don't want
to break my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is that the small farmer
was using another farmer in similar
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, similar soil type to do a
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 200 hectares guy was involved in
the final stage of seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're basically fast to understand
what is a system, generate an interest by
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers, and let farmers be much more
proactive so they actually ask you to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's much easier because I have
several examples around the world with
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the beginning, I was just telling
the students during lunch, I started with
[SPEAKER_00]: a farmer community who actually did not
understand the question several varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: of barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was translated into Arabic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer did not come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked my technician, what is the
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, they do not understand the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean different varieties of
barley?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are different methods that
you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that particular case, I told my
technician, I said, well, you need to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them what we have in the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he told them, he said,
oh, you know, in the station, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: 70,000 different types of barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can imagine the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I said, OK, if you're interested,
I said, would you be interested to see all
[SPEAKER_00]: the 70,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: They start laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually, we went down to 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the first participatory trial
I had in Syria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there I exploited a typical
Arab habit, which is bargaining.
