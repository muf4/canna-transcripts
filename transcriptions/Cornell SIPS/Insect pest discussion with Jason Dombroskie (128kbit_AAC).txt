[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Jason and I am the coordinator
[SPEAKER_00]: for the insect diagnostic lab and the
collection manager for the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University insect collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two jobs wrapped into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'll do over the next little while is
discuss some of the things that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting over the past few months in here
that might be of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm very keen to hear what you've
been getting and I'd be keen to get any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that you might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing as a stupid
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of really good questions from
people that submit things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first thing that comes to
mind for me, it's very fresh in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: is hemlock woolly adelgid, which I'm sure
many of you have been experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just finally spread to my yard a few
days ago or at least I noticed it a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in a neighborhood where the
neighborhood association sent out a
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly worded email warning against
treating your trees for hemlock adelgid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my concerned neighbors thought
it was a little sketchy that they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I did a fact check on it and it
just didn't stand up on many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I respect people's right to treat or
not treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor and I share two hemlock trees
and we chatted over barbecue last night
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will treat them and that the cost
benefit analysis sort of strongly weighs
[SPEAKER_00]: in favor of treating them, probably
thematic cloprid or some other neonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody else been seeing hemlock
woolly adelgid in their counties recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Joyce from Dutchess.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had it for years because especially
along the Hudson River where it's warmer
[SPEAKER_03]: was where we first saw a lot of damage on
some of the stately old hemlocks along
[SPEAKER_03]: with some of the historical sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's come out throughout the county and
about every third year there's another
[SPEAKER_03]: article.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I would like to say is when
the article came out last year,
[SPEAKER_03]: an elderly couple came in and they were
almost ready to weep that they had this
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful hedge and it was going to be
destroyed and what would they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took them outside to the hemlocks
that are here at our farm and home center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had hemlock woolly adelgid for
five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weakened the tree, but I was able to
show them what to look for and ask them to
[SPEAKER_03]: go scout before they hired someone to
spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's new to your area, I would say
that people shouldn't overreact and they
[SPEAKER_03]: should understand what it is they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understand that it doesn't necessarily
kill the things overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Joyce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really keen to hear what the mortality
is like in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the two trees that we are going to
treat are pretty weakened to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not even be worth saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you see much mortality at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to give a rough percentage,
what would you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What we see is they thin over several
years and get to the point where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to look ratty enough that people
take them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones here at our building,
because it's a county building,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're quite thinned with maybe a third
of the tops gone and the bottoms are still
[SPEAKER_03]: green enough that no one has deemed them
to be worthy of damage, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're going to fall down or at the
risk of causing damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jason here, as a hiker and a person
who frequents trout streams, I'm seeing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of mortality on these big old
beautiful hemlock forests on the north
[SPEAKER_02]: slopes in these kind of more untended
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really quite curious to see sort of
where the hemlocks are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think you guys have mentioned,
I suspect it's not 100% mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I guess sort of as we're
experiencing with things like beach bark
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, we're going to eventually select
for more tolerant genotypes that will
[SPEAKER_00]: survive the outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sad to see some of these really
old stately hemlocks go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just curious to see what the
potential introduction of natural enemies
[SPEAKER_00]: will eventually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are unaware,
there's a small beetle called Laracobius
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been introduced that loves hemlock
woolly adelgid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a little chamomile fly
that we're looking at introducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing with the chamomile
fly, it's not been recorded for New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State, but we do have specimens in the
collection from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty close by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more of a jurisdictional thing
that we have to seek permission to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it into New York State, even though it
probably does already occur here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just our knowledge of smaller flies
is pretty sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was going to, unless there's
further questions about hemlock woolly
[SPEAKER_00]: adelgid, there was a comment about winter
cutworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was quite fascinated by that because
most of you probably have realized a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly recent invasive here called Noctua
pernuba.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common name, unfortunately,
is the large yellow underwing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not related to any of our native
underwings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a type of cutworm, but it's got
bright orange hindwings with a black
[SPEAKER_00]: border.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forming is quite variable in pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be from a dull orangish brown to a
mottled darker brownish, almost black.
[SPEAKER_00]: That species was introduced into Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been, I think,
in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sort of sat in Nova Scotia as a
number of invasives have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for some reason or another just
boomed westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the early 1990s, it showed up
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was collecting moths when I
was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just became abundant immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within a few years, I think by
the year 2000, it had made it right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from people that were doing
experiments here at Cornell that the year
[SPEAKER_00]: that species showed up, it just wiped out
various experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a standard cutworm, just like
some of our other pest species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're quite noticeable in that the
larvae are sometimes active mid-winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a bout of warm weather or about
a freezing rain or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem to come out and march around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can be separated from similar
cutworms that are native.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually a little bit bigger
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of hard to judge, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key character to look at is the
markings along the side of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a series of black
rectangles that go from about a third of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way back right to the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those black rectangles are quite
prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only really distinct marking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got that, you've got Noctua
pernuba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to verify, was that the winter
cutworm you were talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was Joyce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because my focus is consumer,
I had a woman call and said, my beagles
[SPEAKER_03]: are eating these caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she called them cutworms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're throwing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they, and are they poisonous?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going in my little diagnostic lab
and looking them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she actually brought in the samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were fast little buggers once
they got warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally emerged all happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went down to our agriculture
colleagues and said, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's winter cutworms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they knew it from a crop pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to figure it out by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was because it was in someone's
lawn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dogs were eating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did find the University of Michigan
article from several years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just so active,
it causes the dogs to throw up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how I learned about the winter
cutworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like that common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you probably know with insects,
common names, unless it's a major pest
[SPEAKER_00]: species, are next to useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary from place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that name because it actually
makes sense, because it is a type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cutworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're most prominent winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much any month of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're multi-volting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have several generations a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the winter, they just really stick out
like a sore thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do wonder if they're chemically
protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I suspect they're probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of queries here in the
diagnostic lab from a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: organic producers, especially
distributors, where they buy organic
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They distribute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: A customer finds a bug in their salad,
and they complain, and sometimes threaten
[SPEAKER_00]: to sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question that the distributor
wants to know, well, there's three
[SPEAKER_00]: questions they want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question is, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second question is, where is it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And third question is, how dangerous is
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first answer, it varies if they
can send me something or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's a grainy cell phone pick of a
black speck that may or may not be an
[SPEAKER_00]: insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they send me a specimen, usually I can
get some sort of name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question, where is it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the answer almost always is
wherever that crop is grown, because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these pests are pretty widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third answer that I say
semi-sarcastically is choice edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these crop pests are perfectly
edible, and you're unlikely to die if you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a few where it's like,
OK, yeah, that will make your stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: upset if you eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as soon as your tongue hits it,
it's going to realize that tastes really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of amazing to me how some
consumers just overreact to a bug in their
[SPEAKER_00]: salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really unfortunate,
and we really need to educate people that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not vegetarian or vegan,
it shouldn't be a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just either throw the salad out and
get a refund, or just ignore it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not winter moth this year, or not winter
moth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter cutworm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are now dealing with the spring
emergence of things like stone flies and
[SPEAKER_02]: huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of rivulets and streams and
wet areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a pest pro come in yesterday
with some stone flies, and the customer
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted him to spray the entire outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: of his house to kill them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just resting on the yellow
siding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do get that kind of, we don't know
what it is, there's a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and shouldn't we just kill it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, as you can imagine,
I deal with those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the more amountable recent ones,
there was someone submitted springtails
[SPEAKER_00]: that were all over her deck last year,
and she wanted to know how to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you could nuke your soil,
but I really don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a natural part of your soil,
get used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it dries out, they'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most dramatic example was a pest
control company in New York City called me
[SPEAKER_00]: up and said, okay, listen, we're calling
you up by request of our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really think there's any need to
do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me photos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it was is the top floor of a
skyscraper adjacent to Central Park,
[SPEAKER_00]: that on the outside of the windows that
are not openable, there were ecumen wasps
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that were working in the
top floor of that building wanted the
[SPEAKER_00]: building sprayed because there are wasps
on the outside of the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just baffled me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very interesting chat with the
pest control operator and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged to give them literature on what
these ecumen wasps actually do and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not dangerous at all, especially
since there's no way for the people to be
[SPEAKER_00]: even in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the sight of them was just
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I'll do, I'll open it up
to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any specific questions
for me?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Joyce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to us about folks' experience with
earthworms or invasive earthworms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really interesting topic and I
can't claim to be an expert on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a topic that's near and dear to
my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, as I'm sure many of you
know, there are no native earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were wiped out by the previous
glacial period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have probably eventually made
it back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expansion rate for earthworms is
typically about a meter or a yard a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either on purpose or by accident have
introduced a number of species of
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworms into New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally from Europe and more recently
several Asian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the garden in general, earthworms
are a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They build soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some strong arguments that
earthworms can be quite detrimental to
[SPEAKER_00]: certain forest systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I used to work up in Algonquin Park
in Ontario, where again there's no native
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworms, you can actually see the
expansion ring of where earthworms have
[SPEAKER_00]: been dropped from someone's bait bucket on
some of the lakes because there's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: limited settlement history there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no earthworms and people have
dumped bait buckets and you can see a ring
[SPEAKER_00]: where the inside of the ring, the leaf
litter lasts less than a season.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, the leaf litter accumulates
for about three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the effects of this is it does change
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, when you get rid of the
leaf litter, yes you do have that nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: pulse, but it also causes the soil to dry
out in the later summer, which is a drier
[SPEAKER_00]: time of the year up there, which can dry
out some of the soil organisms as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does also change over probably long
periods of time the forest composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that typical three-year duff layer
up there, only really big seeds get
[SPEAKER_00]: established or really well nourished
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like sugar maple and beech are
the dominant trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things like eastern hemlock,
yellow birch, and eastern white pine
[SPEAKER_00]: either depend on disturbance, like small
ground fires, or getting established on
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks and logs as they commonly are up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is changing the composition to
favor some of these smaller seeded trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also further south and southern
Ontario, it's favoring things like ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: which now is being nailed by Emerald Ash
Borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely having an impact there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies in Michigan, they're showing
that certain types of botrychium,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the grape ferns that are quite
rare, are being negatively affected by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also depend on thick duff layers of
leaves to protect them from competition
[SPEAKER_00]: from other sort of smaller seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effects depend on what habitat
you're talking about, but definitely they
[SPEAKER_00]: are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My suspicion is that they're really
changing the invertebrate composition of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf litter in forest systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case in point that before earthworms are
here, probably the biggest macro
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposers of dead leaves on the forest
floor were specific types of caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole group of caterpillars
called herminians, they're called leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: litter moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still around, they're still fairly
common, but they probably were the major
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposers, but they're not as efficient
as earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kept a very complex intact habitat,
lots of habitat for things like ground
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles and other insects that live in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect there's some huge effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as far as earthworms getting
dispersed, they're very easy to disperse,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially bringing soil and things like
that, but in studies done in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Alberta, they found that you can find
earthworms speckled along the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of logging roads, and that earthworm eggs
really strongly adhere to the tread of
[SPEAKER_00]: truck tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trucks are distributing them just
by driving from places with earthworms to
[SPEAKER_00]: places without.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sort of answer your questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, because for the others
listening, it is interesting when someone
[SPEAKER_03]: calls up on a rainy day and says,
my lawn is moving, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, help your lawn, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought something up, Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we are talking to folks about creating
backyard biodiversity and building
[SPEAKER_02]: habitat, things like ground beetles that
are great predators, they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: losing their habitat because of these
worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understanding those beetles a little
bit more and knowing what they like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's part of our messaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you build good habitat in your
backyard?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like they need brushy kind
of cover and loose debris that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: hide and hang out in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's two points I want to
make here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is why you see earthworms crawling
around on the surface of the ground on
[SPEAKER_00]: rainy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to believe, as do I think many
other people, that it was because,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, it's raining, they'll drown down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually can survive perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the soil is not constantly
saturated, they can do just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I recall going for a hike back in
my undergrad and just pondering,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do earthworms survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do earthworms cross streams?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking down as I was crossing a
bridge and seeing earthworms on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of this stream wiggling along,
I was like, oh, OK, that's how they swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real reason why they come out on
really rainy days is most species use that
[SPEAKER_00]: as a time to mate and disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's much more efficient to travel
across the surface of the ground than
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's raining, it's moist
enough that they're not going to get too
[SPEAKER_00]: desiccated being above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main dispersal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing was on ground beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure most of you have seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see how common ground
beetles are in an area, go out at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a headlamp, and just shine at the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have really distinctive eye shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two dots that will look right back at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see six or eight dots, those are
typically wolf spiders, also quite common
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sample the ground beetles,
the carabids of your backyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately what you'll find,
unless you're out in a pristine wild area,
[SPEAKER_00]: is most of the dominant species are
European in origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really taken over, especially in
disturbed habitats, and especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to promote ground beetle
diversity in your backyard, basically you
[SPEAKER_00]: need a place for them to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the species that are there are
nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the day, they hide under logs
and rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I always advise people,
especially when I do master gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: trainings, when I talk about how to
promote having beneficial insects in your
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, like ground beetles, is have a
place for them to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surround your garden by things like
cobblestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cobblestones are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of rocks, any sort of debris that
they can go under during the day is
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing about that is,
for people that are really curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: what's there at night, is you can lift
those cobblestones up and have a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that hide there during the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of those things will be
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some things like some of the cutworms
will use that, but on the balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it's generally beneficial to have
places for things to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one enemy to a lot of these
beneficial insects is just lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawns are just biodiversity deserts,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any comments or further questions on that
or something else?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Joyce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to be noisy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a photo of the cutworm if I could
share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can someone give me the ball?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to me, that actually might not be
Noctua pernuba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have those rectangles,
but they're just not quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be another one called
Speedlotus clandestina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clandestine dart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it has another common name as
well, which is a native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to compare to literature on that
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I looked at it, I threw it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I called her, I said,
send me photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the only two photos I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what her dog was eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutworm identification can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably Noctua pernuba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably Noctua pernuba.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of folks emailing us photos
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten past asking them to put the
ants on the phone so that they can tell us
[SPEAKER_02]: who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're sending us photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, we always try to get them to
follow up with a sample or stop by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that people are going more
and more to the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just finding everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're getting really confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look into it,
it's only from South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting a lot of that too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, are you getting a lot of samples
via photo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say even in that short time,
it's drastically increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage people to submit photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because quite often, we can at least
alleviate some of their fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common things people
submit to the diagnostic lab is they are
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about bed bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll send a photo, a dermestid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right away, I can say, OK,
no, that's not a bed bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dermestid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could submit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you what kind and where you
might want to look for it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an interesting question yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was giving a collection tour to a soils
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the students asked me,
OK, so we have this lovely thing called
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet in Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should people submit something to the
diagnostic lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer was quite similar to yours
that, well, for some things, absolutely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a big showy butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can consult the internet and probably
get a reasonable answer for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you've got a background to
entomology, you can sort of figure out or
[SPEAKER_00]: know the reputable website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you all know, there's so much
garbage out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, when someone submits
springtails, I send them a little blurb
[SPEAKER_00]: back on springtails and what to do kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always have to put the caveat,
by the way, springtails do not breed under
[SPEAKER_00]: your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you Google springtails,
unfortunately, you will find articles that
[SPEAKER_00]: say, yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also find articles that say they're
government conspiracies and that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: implanting fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of different things that are
going on in the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use that to sort of understand
what's going on in your brain and your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and controlling things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, most people will sort of
laugh at the last few, but there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: that go down that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spend a fair bit of time on the
phone, especially in the winter with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have gone down the rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be really challenging to
convince them that, Well, A, I'm not part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, that some of these websites are
blowing hot air, that there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people that submit stuff,
I'm just surprised that they didn't Google
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are just so obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had, let's say, a pest on your
hibiscus, it's pretty easy to Google pest
[SPEAKER_00]: hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a good chance you'll get a
reasonable answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some just submit really distinctive
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that I find don't use the
Googles and talk to me first tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of on the older end of things and
just not so internet savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the ones that are really
susceptible to paranoia tend to not even
[SPEAKER_00]: have email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to talk to them either in person
or on the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: With what seems to be an early spring,
we here in the Huffington Valley have all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of things blooming and the red
wings, black birds are back.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think we will see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we see more activity, earlier
activity?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we anticipate in terms of calls?
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh my goodness, what is this in terms
of early spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, it's really hard to
crystal ball these sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an earlier season, what I would guess
is that certain migratory species that
[SPEAKER_00]: become pests, things like corn earworm,
armyworm, they might be able to get here
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and establish sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the big years that we have for those
typically correspond with really warm
[SPEAKER_00]: winters further south.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ideal conditions for them that aren't
too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may see more larger numbers of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that sort of falls into this
pattern is diamondback moth, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: also generally migratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some exceptional individuals
that can overwinter further north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even in New York state, there are
records of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had at least here in Tompkins
County, we only had a few quite cold days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might not have been cold enough
to kill off things like diamondback moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just sort of advances the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be able to squeeze in another
generation and become more of a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it really depends on how much
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the other thing that was quite
striking about this winter, at least here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Tompkins County, is the very little
snow that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cold snaps seem to really hit the
ground quite hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably noticed a lot of needle
ice this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have bare patches of ground where
you get these sharp icy needles that pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up with soil capping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically a condition you get when
you've got no snow cover, cold snap,
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically water through capillary
action comes up for the soil and forms
[SPEAKER_00]: these needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really quite damaging to a lot of
insects that just overwinter in the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In years where you have a lot of snow
cover, and the winter is not exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, you actually have insects and
especially spiders active all winter long
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that certainly probably wasn't the
case, at least during the cold days this
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, since there was essentially no
snow up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short version of my long-winded
answer is it's hard to say, but I suspect
[SPEAKER_00]: a few more pests will get an early head
start this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the forecast for black-legged
ticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, black-legged ticks, also known as deer
ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found very few this winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in previous winters, if I'd go out,
I'd get a few on me on warm days in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it was just slightly below
freezing, you'd still get the odd tick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen none this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's just an anecdote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any real data to support
that, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only way we'll find out is
just by experiencing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more familiar with some of the other
tick species up north, and the big things
[SPEAKER_00]: that seem to knock them back were the fall
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to remember back to what
our fall was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fall conditions being exceptionally
cold and damp were not friendly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were warm dry falls, they seemed
to do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That winter, I suspect, is probably
similar for black-legged ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My short answer is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any kind of hot pests that you
hope you don't get any samples of that we
[SPEAKER_02]: should be on the lookout for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot pests that we don't get samples of
that we should be looking out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few bark beetles that have
been showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a bark beetle workshop two years
ago in Florida, and it is disturbing how
[SPEAKER_00]: many new species show up every year,
especially in the southeast, but also up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can go undetected for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a number of bark beetles that I
would worry about, but quite frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, we have so many non-native
bark beetles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for four specific ones,
I wouldn't worry too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down towards Long Island, southern pine
beetles have seemed to spread north and is
[SPEAKER_00]: nailing a lot of the pines there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far north that one will
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least with the western counterpart,
the mountain pine beetle, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: highly dependent on a lot of old trees and
warm winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is probably a fairly warm
winter, so it might have spread a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further north.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far north it will get
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as other things go, I really don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new longhorn beetle that has
shown up near New York City in Westchester
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unfortunate thing is it's so
indistinctive that the way to key it out
[SPEAKER_00]: is it lacks all the distinctive features
of all the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been well-established in that
yard, and I think it's probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a pest on trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems most of it will be emerging from
firewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some evidence, at least in
Utah, where it's established, that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect fruit trees negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, your guess is as good as
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all need to be prepared for
anything that's sort of new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm asked the question,
OK, how do you prepare for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive, the thing I advise people is be
familiar with what's in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something looks different,
be suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these new invasives that become a
problem, they tend to show up and show up
[SPEAKER_00]: very drastically and suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll stick out to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say probably yes and probably no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with a really healthy garden,
the beneficial insects should be diverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in diversity of species and diversity
of families and orders of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you depend on one species, let's say
one type of ground beetle, chances are
[SPEAKER_00]: some event will knock them all back.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this weird winter where we had almost
no snow cover, and when it got cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no snow cover, it seemed,
yeah, some of the things will be
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with a lot of our native
species, though, is they are adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: this for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, some will get knocked back,
some won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And insect populations will fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my wishy washy answer of maybe,
maybe not, depending, somewhat,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you highlight some of your preferred
sites for gathering some information on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll point out a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Laurie mentioned, the Insect
Diagnostic Lab, if you Google Insect
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnostic Lab Cornell, you'll find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have fact sheets for a lot of
different insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can click on that, and there is
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's information if people want
to submit samples to us, or you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: client that wants to submit to us if it's
a really difficult sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the information for how to send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really key to emphasize that I need
the information on where it's from,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's from kind of thing, and also to
package it appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disturbing how many people it will
put an insect, wrap it up in a Kleenex,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in an envelope, and send it through
the mail, and expect me to piece together
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 pieces of insect and try to identify
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always make sure they put it into some
sort of crush-proof container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the shameless
self-promotion aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, Bug Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bugguide.net, if you've never used this
website, use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bias is I am one of the editors on this
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what you can do,
so if you're completely clueless,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have no idea what you can do,
go to ID Request.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to set up an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically add an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You submit an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what it is, it can be
identified in a few minutes or sometimes a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually someone will move it to an
appropriate place.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I use it a lot is if you go to the
guide, you can pick your insect group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pick beetles for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the family that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've got some sort of scarab
beetle and you want help identifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show you general images.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to browse, it shows you the
different subfamilies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can quickly browse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, OK, I think I've got an
aphrodion dung beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It narrows it down further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that and go right down to
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for each species, there'll be an
image, the info for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them will have elaborate
information on it and habitat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will have a lot more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will have links.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where it gets really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the links where you can get
more information for proper
[SPEAKER_00]: identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you went to 40 ions, you'll see that
link is the really good one to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: things to genera and then to species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for each species, you can also
Google, let's say you've got something on
[SPEAKER_00]: fraxinus, caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sometimes can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives you some of these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you go to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, it kind of looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where they've got specimens from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, it's an Eastern thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the time you see it sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I think, one of the most
useful resources for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just that, but it also will link to
other useful resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this particular species,
here's a link to Moth Photographers Group,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has information and other websites,
so several websites that have further
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, beyond that, start with Bug
Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't have the answer,
it'll link you to the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can always submit to
the insect diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a general rule for people related to
the CCE, if you don't want to pay the $25,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just want a yes or no answer,
I will do that for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a what is this answer,
I do charge for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as if you're expecting yes or no
answer, if maybe is an acceptable answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yeah, I can usually do this for free,
and especially if it's something rather
[SPEAKER_00]: quick like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find my contact info through
the insect diagnostic lab or just Google
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always keen to hear what various
educators get in other cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for a lot of the things that are
easier to identify, I never hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't come across to me very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
