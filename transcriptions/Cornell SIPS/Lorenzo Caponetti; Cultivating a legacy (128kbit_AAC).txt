[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, my name is Lorenzo Caponetti.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a farmer in central Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of the landscape that I can
look at from my place, which is not a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape at all, but is somewhat
challenging in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we are based in a little town that
is called Tuscania, which is about 50
[SPEAKER_01]: miles north from Rome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuscania is not in Tuscany today,
but used to be about the same thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,800 years ago, then some type of
accident happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, again, this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Lake Bracciano, Lake Pico,
Lake Bolsena.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all a volcanic ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just at the edge of it,
just where the volcanic soils are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And onto the pleocenic clays below,
we have 125 acres of total surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different topography, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can see here all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is all cliffs, where the lava come to
an end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our soil is very different from the top
part of the farm to the bottom part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm, which is good, of course,
because diversity is always good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is also challenging in a sense,
because sometimes you want to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: just what you know, and the more you have,
and the more you have to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the other side of the landscape
that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is looking out of the ridge
where the main house is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little river stream of water
that is permanent, but we don't pump any
[SPEAKER_01]: water out of it, because it's so
over-exploited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to be sustainable if we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is to show how our
topography sometimes is very peculiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these types of cliffs that are
very vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the tufa rock that is a
volcanic rock, a volcanic type of
[SPEAKER_01]: formation that is very light, and very
porous, and is retaining a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it ends abruptly with these cliffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these cliffs have been worked out
in the passing centuries by mankind,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point that we have this
single-standing rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all that remains of a cliff that
was there, that was completely hollowed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, either to carve out materials for
building, or for any other kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes that we can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little sort of an open-air cave.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is man-made.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was carved by the Etruscans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a pre-Roman civilization that was
using our grounds, let's say like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: some 2028 to 27 to 2600 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this was carved out in order to
let a road go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Etruscans were very peculiar and very
good at modifying the topography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for having roads go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: The track of an ancient road that was part
of a system of road that later became one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the first roads to ever be paved by the
Romans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's not that everybody in this world
has something like that on his farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds sexy, but it's not that
easy sometimes when you have to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the tombs, these are graves dug by
the same people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seventh and the sixth century BC was
kind of the peak of the Etruscan
[SPEAKER_01]: civilization in our region.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to dig all these underground
cavities to use as graves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to look like houses,
and they were decorated as houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the main leg of the legacy that we
have of them, because their actual houses
[SPEAKER_01]: were built in mud and wood, so we have
very little left of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this nice underground cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a columbarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This used to be a deposit of cinerary
urns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were burying the people, or they were
incinerating them, but it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at all these peak marks,
you can still see today what the people
[SPEAKER_01]: have been working on, and that's the same
plot, but you can have those peak marks
[SPEAKER_01]: that go for miles all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a part of the archeology map of
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the northern part of the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the little road track that I show
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another one that is a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that was actually paved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have here the paving stones that are
still on site, and each of these dots is
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of these dots is one ruin that has
been there for a few thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most of the tombs were installed by
the 7th, 6th century BC, but then in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle Age, all of those were used as
houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been a continuous flow of
history, basically, that I feel on me
[SPEAKER_01]: while farming this piece of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the most, according to
me, most interesting features that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up there is one little tomb,
but down here, this is the entrance to a
[SPEAKER_01]: water tunnel that was, again, dug by the
same people about the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's hard to exactly tell when,
but we can say for sure that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-Roman.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can probably date it to the same time
frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 8th century BC, though it's
more a matter of picturing a time frame
[SPEAKER_01]: between the 11th and the 7th century BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the Etruscan civilization
converted a wide set of marshes and woods
[SPEAKER_01]: that was central Italy into one of the
most sophisticated agricultural system of
[SPEAKER_01]: all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their farming system was a lot closer to
what was maybe 100 years ago than what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we're doing now is to what we were
doing 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that has struck me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a long story short, these are water
tunnels that are cut directly into the
[SPEAKER_01]: bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had luck a few years ago to be
participating with a group of experts that
[SPEAKER_01]: were studying the same type of devices in
12 different countries across the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediterranean and the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very interesting for me to start
from something that I have out on the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and be able to compare with what people
have and what people are doing in other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long story short, these are underground
cavities that are man-made that are
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a depression into the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cut directly into the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly around the world are used for water
collection, especially in Arctic
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our geology, they serve the
multipurpose surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is water collection, but it's also
land reclaiming from on top, diversion of
[SPEAKER_01]: water from the streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used it to modify a lot the
geography of the terrain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a section of an ideal canal,
which is basically the same type of
[SPEAKER_01]: devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking about a sub-horizontal
tunnel, underground tunnel, that is dug
[SPEAKER_01]: directly into the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: With walls that are aligned and let the
water seep in or out of the tunnel into
[SPEAKER_01]: the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a number of shafts that are
connecting the tunnel to the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole thing is quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a passive system, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water is collected from the underground
into the tunnel, and it automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: flows, naturally flows onto the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is water coming up to the surface
available for human activity that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be there, whether or not for the people
who had dug these type of devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more interesting is the fact,
and I was, in the beginning, I was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: giving it for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we bought the farm 20 years ago,
the guy we bought the farm from,
[SPEAKER_01]: he took me there and said, if you don't
periodically go in there and do some
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance, this thing will clog up,
and water wouldn't come out of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK, one more task to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you think of it, if you think
of it, it's not banal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water is coming out of something that
was carved almost 3,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by going into and doing some repair
work, I'm the last one who joined the club
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a club who started 2,800 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's not banal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is the water coming out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is sustainable water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sustainable because it's passive,
so it will never be over-exploiting the
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sustainable because there are a
multiplicity of factors that are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: action in order to make this water
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is water condensation, water
collection from the bedrock, and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, a cross section of a canal,
you can see that there is an exchange of
[SPEAKER_01]: water between the underground and the
inside of the tunnel that goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes the water is draining into,
or sometimes the water is draining out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and replenishing the water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is particularly important in our
geology when we have multiplicity of
[SPEAKER_01]: strata that are superimposed to one
another because our volcanic activity went
[SPEAKER_01]: on for a number of about a million years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is also quite important for
contrasting the effect of climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our climate, climate change is
concentrating waterfall more and more into
[SPEAKER_01]: peaks and alternating with drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our soil is very porous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our bedrock is able to retain about one
third of our rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually use that in order to
infiltrate tidal flow into the underground
[SPEAKER_01]: that then will be able to be used again in
the past, in a future, a later time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the map of the tunnel that we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually getting the exit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aligned with the church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's the church to be aligned
with the exit of the tunnel since the
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnel was there first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The meaning of the church is that,
again, these type of devices are water
[SPEAKER_01]: producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you walk into the tunnel, all the
length of the tunnel, you don't see a
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the water coming in,
but you see the water coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is pretty magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it has always been associated
with a metaphysical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of those around our
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the natural conservancy of
Tuscania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, very different geology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the study that we did around the
tunnel in order to understand and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: determine that the water tunnel is not
hitting the water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that water is sustainable, even because
it's a resource that is shared,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is very limited in regard to the
community who is using it, and is related
[SPEAKER_01]: to a very limited portion of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the water that is coming out of
the water tunnel is unpolluted,
[SPEAKER_01]: while we got plenty of nitrous in this
one, because this is a much vaster
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vaster the resource and the vaster
the community who is using it and the more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely there will be tensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not the case for a water
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm happy to do maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a friend of mine, actually,
from New York City who is helping me out
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to know that the club who
started with the Etruscan 2,500 years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: can enlist people that are willing to be
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are still having water today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, this is not on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Lake Vico.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just to remind how the Etruscans
were able in managing the territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: This lake has an artificial emissary,
which is underground, which is a tunnel,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is giving water to the city of
Ronciglione.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was basically to lower the level of
the lake so that all these northern parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the crater could be put into
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Etruscan did this in a number of
different cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of extraordinary to think of
what they did in terms of, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating arable land and cultivatable
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, this is not the legacy of the
Etruscans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not everybody knows, but it's them
who started to select out of a cardoon an
[SPEAKER_01]: artichoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to have in my garden
something that is going, that is keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: going, that is still a legacy of that
land, not because of the topography of the
[SPEAKER_01]: land, but because of the people who used
to live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, these are some of my
olive trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the younger guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are out of my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also a legacy of the
Etruscans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's still the Etruscans that by
converting all that into an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: system, they started the cultivation of
olive tree in central Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very important concept for
me, especially speaking with olive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might wonder why is the olive tree
that is quoted 76 times in the Old
[SPEAKER_01]: Testament alone, and it's not a plum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might wonder why it's two branches
of olive tree that are used into the log
[SPEAKER_01]: of the United Nations, and it's not just a
palm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason is that olive tree is,
of all cultivated plants, is the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: has the longest lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can stay there and produce for 1,000
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're planting something like
this, the first time, you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: well-settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be a nomadic gatherer
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be settled in a society that
is giving you the power to defend your
[SPEAKER_01]: work if push comes to shove, which means
that you're planting something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be identified in the society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So family names and private names,
concept-like property, private property of
[SPEAKER_01]: land, a structured society with somebody
to refer to if you're in trouble,
[SPEAKER_01]: a structure society means that,
of course, that community is able to farm
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that is creating a surplus,
or it wouldn't be possible to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: structure society.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the structure society is also implying
differentiated architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we end up with the city,
but also writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all features of what we call the
urban revolution of the Etruscan between
[SPEAKER_01]: the 11th and the 7th century BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They introduced all of these elements,
including the olive tree and including the
[SPEAKER_01]: water tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all part of a big picture in
which it's impossible to determine the
[SPEAKER_01]: relation between cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's amazing to see how they were able
to put all this in action and how are we
[SPEAKER_01]: still dealing with the legacy of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, olive tree lives so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at this twig, this is another
peculiarity of the olive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The olive tree has buds even in grown-up
parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only plant that can survive
being chopped off the ground and
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted even when it's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this also has a different meaning,
because if you let it go, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: in its soul, an olive tree is a shrub,
because it will just not have one main
[SPEAKER_01]: trunk, but it will have multiple
shootings, which means in turn that the
[SPEAKER_01]: trunk there is a man-made thing,
thanks to 200 years of clipping,
[SPEAKER_01]: of this clipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also is a good metaphor for a
legacy and an alliance between man and
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another part of why the olive
tree is so looked upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a symbol of all the Western
civilization, if we want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Greeks and the Etruscans, they started
to divide people between civilized
[SPEAKER_01]: barbarians, whether they were cultivating
or not the olive tree and the grapevine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, these are not the only legacies
that we are dealing with while farming in
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all yellow, but it wasn't so in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all green, but it's not
necessarily going to be green in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is three maps on the aridity index.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if my translation is good
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it's the combination of the
amount of water and the state of soils
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is 1950, and this is 60 to the
90s, and this is 71 to 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my farm is exactly here, exactly on
that line between that yellow and the
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that line wasn't there 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we do about all this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we are managing the farm
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, all the different colors have a
meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, houses, olive trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue is where the animals are,
or where those paddocks that are mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: for animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our animals are horses and cows,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a few pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green is the vegetable gardens or
future orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red is arable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow is those land that can only be
pastured, even because they're woods or
[SPEAKER_01]: pastures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our concept, as an ecological concept,
we want to add as many items into elements
[SPEAKER_01]: into our ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of doing a monoculture,
of course, we're going to add more
[SPEAKER_01]: elements to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is easy to read for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is kind of an outline of all the
stuff that is going on in the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working basically on four different
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is farming proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the sustainability of
the whole farm will come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction of these four different levels
among themselves, hopefully, one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what have we done so far dealing with
all these legacies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it came easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough that it came easy for
me to start with dealing with the olive
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a clue what an olive tree
was when I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a clue of how to prune it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have the clue on how to harvest
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, these guys were still giving me
one of the best products in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to start traveling in
this part of the world and meeting with
[SPEAKER_01]: some top-notch chefs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are the one who I owe the fact
that I recognize the value of this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in the beginning, you're in Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody in Italy has an olive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's farming olive trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think, well, it's an olive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start traveling in New York
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got your product acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find out that simply by harvesting
something that is on your farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing, you're doing something that is
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms that there might be potentially
other products that are just as good but
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone a bit far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me 15 years to understand how to
prune a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm finally finding the way to put
those back into action.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in action a few things like,
of course, all of our groves have grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are mulching the clipping right on site
instead of burning like everybody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't understand why they keep
burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes a lot more energy and a
lot more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all carbon going to feed the
greenhouse effect instead of feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, basically the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to say that we have orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have orchids in this orchard because we
never till.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, we harvest, we prune,
and we sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to say that I was able to reach,
again, a few chefs in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying from me a couple of the
biggest, most famous restaurant in this
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the world, which, of course,
is helping me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not directly done under the economic
point of view, which, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped me out because I wouldn't be
here today if it wasn't for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped me out in building something
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture is also to remind that the
whole thing might be a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the climate change is going to affect
the production of our trees, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: in two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Milder climate through the winter might
inhibit blossoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, there's the olive tree has
very peculiar water needs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically coordinated so far with how the
season goes in terms of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two peaks in the spring,
one in the spring, one in the fall,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this long drought in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that the olive trees
like as long as they have rains in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall or they have rains in that particular
moment in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that shifts, then the whole thing might
be affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is particularly true with olive
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a peculiar substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be a producer of olive oil
because it's the only food that comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the table after being processed that is
still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no heat, no fermentation involved
in the making.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the squeezing, which means that
the enzyme that are into the olive when
[SPEAKER_01]: the olive is on the tree, they don't get
killed during the processing, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure that you're growing tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would wish that all of your customers
could eat the tomato right out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of the garden in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do with my olive oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that even in New York 5,000 miles
away or six months later because this
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps being fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, I don't need to process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to pasteurize because there's
no bacteria that can grow in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other side is that anything that
is into the oil is not there because of
[SPEAKER_01]: me, but it's there because of my plants
and my terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my terroir is changing because the
climate is shifting, I might not be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just another picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just briefly go through olive oil making.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of the olives getting into
the olive mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That picture is taken at night because
again, it's all a matter of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to inhibit certain enzymes to
start working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we harvest during the day
and we press at night and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have other things to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe at the Q&A, if anybody has
more questions, about it, I would be happy
[SPEAKER_01]: to come back at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is to say that this is how
we deal with one of the legacies that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are dealing with on our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful to be dealing with something
that made me famous in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just found it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to pick it up, put it in action
in a way that would be sustainable for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a great product that is taking
me all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: How else did we deal with these legacies?
[SPEAKER_01]: How else did those legacies inspire what
we're doing today on the farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely the water tunnel was a
great inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in the beginning, I didn't care
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a water tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go in and they silt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you start realizing that,
hey, this is not banal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to try to understand,
how is it possible that something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: done 3,000 years ago is still giving us
water today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there are a few keys to the
sustainability of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, one key is the passive
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's led by gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another key to the function of it is that
it allows for water exchanges all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through the length of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why you see water coming
out of it and you don't see the water
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into it is because the water that
is collected there is basically there
[SPEAKER_01]: because of what we call hidden rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it hidden rains because you don't
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just basically a condensation of
micro quantities, micro droplets of water
[SPEAKER_01]: that can get condensed or could gather a
micro droplet per every square inch
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplied per tenths of meters or
hundreds of meters of length of a tunnel
[SPEAKER_01]: end up in something tangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, these two concepts,
water driven by gravity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of very small quantities
multiplied by very large numbers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: at the base of the water tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on these two principles,
I was able to reconsider all of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: management system on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have a little pump that is
operated by the sun and a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: containers that are put on different
places and different heights on the hill
[SPEAKER_01]: flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept is that the PV is operating a
pump that is the only pump that can go
[SPEAKER_01]: straight into a PV system because it's a
non-rotative, it's a piston pump that is
[SPEAKER_01]: hooked up directly to the PV system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's starting to pump as soon as the
sun is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will go on until the sun is not
there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the quantity per minute is
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the minutes are a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can lift a lot of water every day as
long as we have somewhere to store it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the somewhere to store it,
again, this might all sound banal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't banal to me to put it in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept of storing water is a concept
that implies, where do I store it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do I need it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up having five different
containers right now that each is filled
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each is filled by the overflow of the
previous one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're feeding each tank with the
overflow of the previous one, it means
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to know in advance where you
want your water to be and what are your
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first tank is for potable use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is for drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drinking water for the horses and the
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have three that are feeding
our gardens that are at different heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my collaborators checking
on the quality of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but I didn't have any other
picture of the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are three tanks that are
feeding through our garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's not that we want to be
something that is stuck in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using modern technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the fact that this technology,
this way of using modern technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: was inspired by the past because it's
somewhat holistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the one choice of changing the pump
has brought me to have to invent where to
[SPEAKER_01]: put the containers and the way the
containers are distributed along the hill
[SPEAKER_01]: flank and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm proud to say that now we're
running on zero emission in terms of water
[SPEAKER_01]: management for the gardens and all the
animals on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did we deal with the legacy again?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we combined with the local county
government who is running the conservancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only farm who was able to
actually build a trail and is open to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can come and see our farm five
days a week between 10 AM and one hour
[SPEAKER_01]: before the sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just open because we feel that a
tomb doesn't belong to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It belongs to mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to be closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, this is bringing
people to the farm, which is good because
[SPEAKER_01]: we want the people to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just briefly something that we
had to build for the trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a staircase that is partly held by
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since part of it is on the bedrock and
part is on the trees, we had to invent
[SPEAKER_01]: this system of letting the trees swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a nightmare to design,
but it was so much fun to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm proud to say that it's there now
and it's free of access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this is a piece of a shard of
pottery that was found on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a dolium, which is a big
vase that the Romans used to store wine or
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a legacy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way of dealing with that is we're
actually holding archaeological excavation
[SPEAKER_01]: every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're cleaning up with the help of a
community of people, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are cleaning up a piece of,
this is kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the pillow and the bed leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hosting a seminar and events on
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all the part that was
inspired by the legacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, where's the food coming
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all nice ideas, but these guys
need to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys need to eat, and these guys
need to eat as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more than that to the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you, in terms of agricultural
production, we have about 10 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: olive trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 30 horses on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have eight cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few pigs for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about a couple of acres of
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking into being more and more
self-sufficient as much as we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: even because there's no point in wanting
to output on the market some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: production if simply the market is not
able to pay for it in order for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: make money enough to make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, this is just a very,
you will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, grass can be grazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grazing can be considered an
intercropping, but grass is also
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting soil from soil erosion,
is holding moist and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, the cows and the horses are
grazing in two completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: systems because one is a polygastric,
one is a monogastric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one likes the tall grass, one likes the
short grass, one likes the grasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other one likes legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of the two are able to interrupt
the cycle of the intestinal parasite of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can actually help each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also to show how big our trees are
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are guys that were planted in early
50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still fairly young in terms of
olive trees, and still a tree like this
[SPEAKER_01]: can provide a solid 250 to maybe 300
pounds of olives every year, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, where's the food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some zucchinis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zucchinis, with a view, they grow happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the layout of the garden and
what will be the grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not actually there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the garden is organized in 20
different fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a 10-year rotation,
which might sound a bit too complicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's OK because we have artichokes and
alfalfa in it that are staying for a total
[SPEAKER_01]: of almost five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So half of our soil we don't really have
to look after.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we're going the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got artichokes for two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chop the artichoke off.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing is actually we take these
plants off after they finish producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most part of the people, they will leave
it until October in order for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: spring back so that they can take clones
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing, we're just taking the
whole plant off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And transplant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let it come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we transplant it in the next
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually are able to use this field
in the summer for brassicas or winter
[SPEAKER_01]: squash, whatever is still available there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we have 10-year rotation is
because the bulk of our summer crops is
[SPEAKER_01]: nightshades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have twice the size for nightshades
than for the other families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we have a 10-year rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they come basically back every
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing, especially for
tomatoes, it works really well because
[SPEAKER_01]: these are coming out of the alfalfa they
don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for tomatoes, what we're doing,
we are planting the hairy vetch ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just cut it and use it as a
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are transplanting on sod instead of
transplanting on till land.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of important in our climate
because this allows us to anticipate the
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're transplanting before the rainy
season instead of after, which is good
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is saving us a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're doing lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're doing zucchini and cucumber and
melons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got the alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we have a few fields that
are in alfalfa, a few fields that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: artichokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, of course, leguminous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got leguminous in here also.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing, we're planting
subterranean clover underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: artichokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is supposed to act as a
perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I didn't get there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plan is to build a movable chicken
coop and graze the chickens onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: clover and onto the alfalfa so that that
will even boost even more my nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm going through quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after, if you want to,
I can come back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of our another thing is that
we have, where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we've got clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is ryegrass or something like
that because we're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we've got one species,
two species, three species in a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes even more in the same field,
which is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the concept,
alternating permanent crops with crops
[SPEAKER_01]: that are temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting into starting our own
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I was fairly new
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're starting to save our own seeds,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though, I mean, this is a bit hazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these fennels are looking pretty happy
to me in any case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radicules that are getting in,
cabbages, we've got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had way too many cauliflower this year,
not because we planted too many,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because each of them was 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the Catholic family garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have 12 kids to go through the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so this is some of the garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, of course, do rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We alternate the garlic and the carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is some part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is the young tomatoes in a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are the same guys,
but bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing, again, here you see
the clear soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is sod.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not tilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can go through the summer quite
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a continuous struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is an older guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, every time there's something
complaining, say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not the way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, OK, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it this way in any case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, hey, you know,
there's no grass at all in this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, wonder why.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the artichokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we chop the whole thing off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pot it basically so that we can
concentrate the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is a very limiting factor in our
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, this is clearing the
field so we can put the cabbages in
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense to me to have a bit more
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the artichoke finally going
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the clover was planted about
one month before, one to two months
[SPEAKER_01]: before, and just following the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys are pretty healthy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the secret weapons that we
use for the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you might be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a spader.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the picture that I took of it the
day I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought this from a neighbor who didn't
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to have it in his yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it by the pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a very heavy piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dates back to 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sustainable also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And above all, I was kind of amazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture that I took when I
bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with one strike, it goes from this
to this, which is, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they all discarded because you
have to go so slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I could go slow if that's the
result, especially the way it chops
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, which is kind of big chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this is the other secret
weapon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even here, there's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it pays off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we till it under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we do till.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you might want to consider that
with this, you can just back and just plow
[SPEAKER_01]: a little strip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be minimum tilling also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum tilling might be also to just
concentrate the tilling to where you need
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked several times if I think that
being an organic farmer would be more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult than being a conventional
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends how you measure your
outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your outcome is only making money,
then maybe being a conventional farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: would be easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you measure your outcome in a
different way, then you might be in
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble if you're a conventional farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I measure my outcome by trying to
understand how much can I be of help to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are having woofers and interns and
people that are coming to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made a precise choice in terms of
entrepreneurship in organizing our system
[SPEAKER_01]: on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a system that requires a lot of
hand labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to come up with the opening
ourselves to new people that want to come
[SPEAKER_01]: and help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, these people that
are coming and help, they're coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stay with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can live together and be happy
together and be having the feeling that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working jointly on something that is
a common goal, no matter where we are from
[SPEAKER_01]: and no matter what our life is to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody is working all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are definitely sharing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are sharing food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good outcome, especially
because this doesn't clash with the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making that much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can stay in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, there's more than
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this is a picture of old ladies back
in the old days harvesting olives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like working the way I do,
not just because I don't just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember about this, but I want to
reproduce it, if possible, in a modern
[SPEAKER_01]: key.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are building a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part of I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the picture of a calendar that
we're putting on sale here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States as a fundraiser to sponsor
scholarships for students to come and work
[SPEAKER_01]: on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are willing to build up an ongoing
community of students on the farm with
[SPEAKER_01]: people from different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're shooting right now for three people
at the time, one out of farming school,
[SPEAKER_01]: one out of culinary school, one out of
herbaristic and naturopath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe that knowledge is
holistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that it would be a great
experience for somebody just out of school
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay six months or one year in a
different country working on something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is specific, and yet being exposed to
somebody that has a similar background
[SPEAKER_01]: that is limited to what he or she is
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I'm practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being practical, I acknowledge that
there's always so much that I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the farm and that I should know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the most valuable tool for
my farm would be something that will
[SPEAKER_01]: always be spending nights on books in
order to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yeah, I know some about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, again, one page of the
calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept is that we have chefs for each
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each page is one picture that is telling
you something about the olive oil
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, it's one chef telling you what
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I call this a community
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these are all chefs in the United
States that are buying from us and that
[SPEAKER_01]: are willing to support us in something
that is actually supporting American
[SPEAKER_01]: students to come over to the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part I like because,
basically, we're all united.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all fractals into a larger picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are not able to see the larger
picture and are only focusing on what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to remind us that man was able
to participate both in the miracle of
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the yellow into green,
which we are still able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a lot better in turning the green
into yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we want to be
very careful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no matter what, this is all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not an outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little plant like this that I
took out of my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots are coming all the way like
this, which I take it as a good sign that
[SPEAKER_01]: my soil is doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, organic matter is 2.69 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 140 five years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this guy to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is farm crew taking a breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, this is more than
farm crew, because it's these guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to hold on for this line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything goes through the organic matter
and the fertility of soil that is able to
[SPEAKER_01]: retain water, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we want to remember what
good us at mankind were able to do in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past and the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture I took in the Aral Sea
in Uzbekistan in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the biggest man-made disaster in
terms of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just unbelievable to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we want to remember all that
has been going through in the passing
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I look at those trees,
and that's why I call it a challenge to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a farmer in Italy, because every time I
look at those trees, I can't but picture
[SPEAKER_01]: the 3,000 years of history that made it
possible for those trees to be there
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start wondering, what are we doing
today for somebody that will be here in
[SPEAKER_01]: 3,000 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you don't want to answer that
question, because honestly, we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking the whole thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, every time I look at this
landscape, I'm just wondering,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I doing the right thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I'm desilting the water tunnel,
are we doing the right thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that I'm doing the right
thing in calling over people from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world and share what I'm doing and
share what I have in order to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: what the boss or best possible outcome
will be, how to measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monuments we can't eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The odd trees we can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also as a way of remembering the way
mankind has been able to be respectful to
[SPEAKER_01]: this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Ballet de l'Or.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Golden Ballet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's looking for gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gold is tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gold is producing something that is
able to feed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can't but take the water
tunnel as a metaphor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm going reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: For what good man has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we'll be able to reproduce
this in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was wondering what that was.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might do so if climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, we wouldn't do it in the
summer because in the summer, the odd tree
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to have at least a solid month to
two months of drought in order to create
[SPEAKER_01]: the antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's done in the wrong period of time,
it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are stories of farmers that spend
huge amounts of money in order to create
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation lines for the odd trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that water is just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you squeeze the oil, the water
goes down the drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it does bad because the
antioxidants are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than they are liposoluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the antioxidant will go with the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be careful in irrigating
the odd trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need water in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will need water in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they will not need water in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use it once you plant your
trees because you want to boost the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get into production,
you want to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, our orchard,
a long story short, the bulk of our trees
[SPEAKER_01]: were planted in early 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were planted in combination with
vines, with grapevines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our trees are very much spaced apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the grapevine was ripped off the
ground back in the 70s for subsidies that
[SPEAKER_01]: pay farmers not to be farmers anymore or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our gardens are embedded into
the part of the olive groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of our fields are as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a very common concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a text in the 1600s in
Italy that already talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: intercropping trees with other type of
cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think there is anything wrong
with it, except for the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, this is a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't let us do mechanical
harvesting of the trees because we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: access the tractor into the gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to go with handmade harvest,
which, of course, requires a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few tools that can help with
that, but still is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need a lot of labor to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically one of the main
problems with the bulk of the groves
[SPEAKER_01]: today, especially in Italy, that they were
planted and laid out maybe even only 50
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, like in this case, which is
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were laid out and designed in a
moment in which nobody would think about
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting mechanically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not sustainable on the market
because our cost of production in Italy is
[SPEAKER_01]: 7 euros a liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: A liter is a quarter of a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in Spain, which is still Europe,
that drops to 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Tunisia, that drops to I
don't know what, because of cost of labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why a lot of people are ending
up ripping off their groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of a disaster because
they're ripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those groves that are more prone to
be ripped off are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually strongholds against climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Olive tree is a very peculiar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it can grow on a pile of rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can grow and bear fruit with less
than 400 millimeters of rain per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been used by mankind as a
conquering plant in order to switch from
[SPEAKER_01]: that yellow into green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a key factor of the olive tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've gotten to the other end,
which people are ripping those plants off
[SPEAKER_01]: only because they cannot make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like bullshit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we call this progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if there are any more
questions or if lunch is calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't plant any more trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the bulk of my trees are of a
variety that's called canino, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: local variety that takes the name from the
next town over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a heirloom local variety
that was used forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fits very well that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the ones that were planted
in the early 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when in the 70s, they took the vines
off, there are two parts of the farm in
[SPEAKER_01]: which the ground is so shallow that you
wouldn't be able to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they planted more planting there in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are two different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frantoio and leccino, which are very
productive and very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of them are very early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being early in our climate means that
they're very prone to the attack of a
[SPEAKER_01]: parasite that is the olive fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of likely that we wouldn't be
able to harvest much of those trees today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't plan to add more trees right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I will ever do in the
future because there are so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: orchards around us that are kind of
neglected because people don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a living with it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a long story short is olive trees
has always been planted in small batches,
[SPEAKER_01]: only to support the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a number of places around me
that have maybe 10 trees, 20 trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, that are never big enough to make a
living today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to represent wealth back in the
old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nowadays it's just lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you in the picture with
all the farm with all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: colors, the colors were kind of getting
out of the farm limits because we are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to team in with neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we are lucky to be able to sell
our crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I better team in more farmers or
team in more trees instead of planting
[SPEAKER_01]: more on my own grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would make sense to start
new grows when we have old ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: dying.
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: My success is not that big yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that are looking
at what I'm doing with great interest,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm able to sell my product ahead
of time almost every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell out with a price that is almost
twice as much as the common market price
[SPEAKER_01]: for the same or equivalent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm trying to do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for my product to stand up,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not said that other people
couldn't do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing this by cutting the cost
of production in terms of money because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using volunteer workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that we are not paying them,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're paying in a different currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of how we stay in business is
because we are working in these two
[SPEAKER_01]: different currencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is giving away what we have,
which is meat, which is good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food, which is landscape, which is being
in Italy, which is our knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sharing what we have and what we
know, which is something that we're very
[SPEAKER_01]: rich of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, has this come to the point where
other farmers around me are willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: team in with me just for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is also a generational problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turned 40 a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been on that farm, managing that
farm 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a newbie in a country that is kind of
conservative farmers that have been there
[SPEAKER_01]: for 700 generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, this is the way to do it because
my father used to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my grandfather used to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep going my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, how do you measure your
outcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not unhappy of what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't just be forcing other people
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a matter of philosophy,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully one day, maybe my business,
my success, will be so big that my
[SPEAKER_01]: economic success will overpower the
differences in philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not my main occupation right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main occupation is trying to stay in
business and run a farm, not just be a
[SPEAKER_01]: sociologist for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe for the future, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there is plenty of evidence,
not on my farm, but there is plenty of
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence that the water tunnels that I'm
talking about of Etruscan origin are at
[SPEAKER_01]: the base of the Roman aqueducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly the same concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of what we know of as Roman hydraulic
technology has been invented by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Etruscans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pockets of intelligentsia of
the Etruscan people into the Roman society
[SPEAKER_01]: that were still managing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only important invention in terms of
hydraulic technology into the Roman time
[SPEAKER_01]: is the reverse siphon that came much
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the principle is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also this horizontal structure,
linear structure, that got bigger and
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that the Romans
actually did is couple those with the arc,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the building of the arch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other difference is basically the
difference in the society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the tunnels into the Etruscan
society were feeding small communities
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was a society that was very
spread out, while the Roman power,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, was a central power that was
able and had the need to lay out and had
[SPEAKER_01]: built these huge works that, of course,
went on as long as the central power was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to defend itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, they collapsed after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's absolutely a continuity in the
two technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference in terms of water is
that the walls are unlined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water can seep through the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is water exchanges between
the inside of the tunnel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: underground versus an aqueduct that is
only made to transport water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have the walls lined with
waterproof plaster that will retain water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
