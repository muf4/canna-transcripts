[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Gary, for that very
nice introduction, and thank you to all of
[SPEAKER_01]: you for attending my talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to share a little bit
about my research experience and thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: I have going forward as a vegetable
breeder at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to tailor the talk more for the
pathology audience, but I'd like to start
[SPEAKER_01]: just by giving an overview of my current
research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a tomato and eggplant breeder here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three kind of overarching
objectives of my lab's research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are to discover the genetic basis of
traits, important to growers or consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: to model strategies for how to implement
new technologies in the context of a very
[SPEAKER_01]: applied cultivar development program,
and then finally to develop and release
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of tomato and eggplant that meet
the needs of stakeholders in New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk a little bit more about each
of those objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of cultivar development for
New York and the Northeast, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: really diverse stakeholders, markets,
and needs in our region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm talking about tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato is grown in an open field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in our state, we have companies
growing tomatoes in some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: high-tech environments that tomatoes are
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown in and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Green Empire Farms outside of
Syracuse, where they grow tomatoes under
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 acres of the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes are grown for wholesale markets,
including at produce auctions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an important outlet for many of
the Amish and Mennonite growers in our
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're grown and sold directly to
consumers at farmers' markets and farm
[SPEAKER_01]: stands and through CSAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is also a state where over 90% of
the population lives in urban
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people interested in
growing vegetables in these environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are a lot of needs to develop
varieties that do well in those distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, New York is a very diverse state,
and there are many people in our state who
[SPEAKER_01]: are interested in growing crops that are
important to their heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eggplant is a really great species to
meet some of those needs, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so many diverse types that people are used
to from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those types is the African
eggplant, or selena, and the opicum seen
[SPEAKER_01]: here that my lab is starting some research
on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned I'm interested in testing
how to implement new technologies in an
[SPEAKER_01]: applied vegetable cultivar development
program, and one of the things that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in is genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're familiar with that,
genomic selection is the idea of combining
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypic and phenotypic information on
what's called a trading population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using that information to develop
statistical models, and then applying
[SPEAKER_01]: those models to populations of plants for
which we might not have any phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might not ever observe their
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually predict their phenotypes
based exclusively on molecular markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a technology that's been
implemented pretty widely in breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs for agronomic crops over the past
10 years or so, but the adoption of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables has been a little bit slower
for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I think traits in vegetables are more
difficult to quantify, either because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the throughput.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't drive a combine through a field
and quantify yield on thousands of plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go out there and pick them
multiple times during the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also some traits are just more
intangible and difficult to turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really successful breeders can walk
through their field and visually identify
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are superior in terms of their
growth habit, fruit shape, their color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that are more challenging
to equip and particularly turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really interested in working with
the expertise we have here on campus to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of showcase how we can implement
these technologies in a practical way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, genetic discovery and
pre-breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been one of the most important
legacies of public sector vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: In tomato, if you go to the farmers market
and look at tomatoes, you'll see such a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of shapes and colors and sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But despite all that morphological
diversity, there's actually pretty limited
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic diversity, especially compared to
what's found in the related species of
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticated tomato in wild species in
South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant breeders have introgressed so many
genes of commercial importance from these
[SPEAKER_01]: wild species into domesticated tomato that
if you look at commercially available
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties coming out now and compare them,
it's commercially available varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out 50 or 75 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their genetic diversity is much greater
because of how much wild species DNA has
[SPEAKER_01]: been introgressed into tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the projects that my lab is
starting to work on is working with
[SPEAKER_01]: selenium cities, which is actually one of
the most distantly related allied species
[SPEAKER_01]: of tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows in the Atacama Desert of Chile,
which is a region that receives on average
[SPEAKER_01]: like half an inch of rainfall a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty remarkable if you look at
these pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are landscapes that are like devoid
of all plant life, but somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: miraculously where like wild tomatoes
growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years, this was a species that
breeders didn't really have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: working with because of cross
compatibility barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently, a team at UC Davis,
through a very complex crossing scheme and
[SPEAKER_01]: many years of effort, were able to develop
a set of integration lines with DNA from
[SPEAKER_01]: this species in the backyard of a
domesticated tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to work at that for some
abiotic stress tolerances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important traits that have come
from wild tomatoes have been disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistances.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rest of my talk, we're going to
talk about how it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the genetics, not just of the
host, but of the pathogen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously not a novel concept at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fundamental, I think,
to the field of plant pathology and was
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrated by Floor in the 50s,
working on flax and flax rest,
[SPEAKER_01]: who showed that the disease outcome
depended on the genotype of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: also the genotype of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She summarized very succinctly in this
conclusion to this very seminal paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of how I kind of like came around
to this concept 70 years after everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else did, I want to talk about the
research I did on phytophthora capsici as
[SPEAKER_01]: a graduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're unfamiliar with phytophthora
capsici, it causes a disease called
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a disease that's very difficult to
manage, you know, for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a couple of reasons, it produces these
think-well and resting spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are sexual spores that can survive
in the soil for over 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: dormant in the absence of a susceptible
host.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a really explosive asexual
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these perangia that you can see on the
surface of this pumpkin fruit here,
[SPEAKER_01]: in wet conditions, they differentiate into
20 to 40 moldable cell spores that in wet
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions can swim through water and
identify an impulsive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phytophthora blight causes a range of
disease symptoms, different disease
[SPEAKER_01]: syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes damping off, it causes reek and
crown rot, causes fruit rot, it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: salination species, concurrence,
a couple of other recorded vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one kind of consistent thing that
we've seen with phytophthora blight is
[SPEAKER_01]: that often it's introduced to farms in
flood waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a farmer may have no experience with
this disease, there'll be a really severe
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall event, a neighboring body of
water will flood, and then a week or two
[SPEAKER_01]: later, they'll see really severe crop loss
in their fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's introduced, it's pretty much
impossible to eradicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, the change that we see
in our weather patterns, it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's becoming more and more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started my PhD, I came into an
ongoing project on breeding for resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: to squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, and actually still today,
there's really no commercially available
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance in squash to phytophthora root
and crown rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a project that was a
collaboration between Chris's lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Mazurek's vegetable breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: The methods that we used for selecting
resistance were pretty straightforward,
[SPEAKER_01]: but very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would grow our population of seedlings
in the greenhouse, inoculate them with the
[SPEAKER_01]: suspension of zoospores, and then a week
or two later, sort through all those dying
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and find the ones that are the most
green and pop those up and use those for
[SPEAKER_01]: more crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, this worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the results of this project into
field trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see a susceptible zucchini
goldspark, or maybe you can't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: because the plants are pretty much dead at
this point, a couple of weeks after
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the source of resistance
that was used in this resistance breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it has somewhat of an
intermediate phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lines that we developed
actually had resistance levels superior to
[SPEAKER_01]: the resistant period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, in the process of selecting
more or less exclusively based on seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, we lost a lot of the traits
that make it good as a zucchini,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we did show that you can select for
resistance to phytophthora root and crown
rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time in the greenhouse
inoculating seedlings and associating
[SPEAKER_01]: variation in the disease response with
variation in the DNA polymorphisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying QTL related to resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within several different experiments,
we mapped a total of six QTL related to
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora crown root rot resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that these QTL individually had
very small effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at these plots, these are
showing the allelic effects of markers in
[SPEAKER_01]: these regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at their effect on
relative ADBC, it's very slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And individually, these markers explain
anywhere from like two to 10% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, collectively, they can make
pretty big differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you increase the number of QTL
that are fixed for the resistant allele,
[SPEAKER_01]: lines that had five of these resistant
resistance QTLs compared to lines that had
[SPEAKER_01]: zero had pretty substantial difference in
terms of their disease response.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, this is pretty
challenging for a breeder to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: because a breeder is not just selecting
for these five genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably many more genes that we
weren't able to map.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're even of smaller effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selecting for resistance to other
diseases, growth habit, fruit shade,
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when selecting for like a single
qualitative R gene, often it's difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the other genes that tend to
come along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So selecting for five small effect genes
is really, really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that wasn't challenging about
phytophthora root and crown rot resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: in squash was that it was really
consistent across different strains of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see disease incidence over
time in two varieties are resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding line and susceptible as a candy
check.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different line types are different
strains of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this a few times with different
strains, both from around New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found pretty similar results
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really matter what strain was
inoculated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all cause similar levels of disease
and there were no interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resistance level of the plant genotype
was not conditional on which isolate it
[SPEAKER_01]: was challenged with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very different case than the
case in Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to talk more about that in
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I became exposed to this
phenomenon in Pepper was through field
[SPEAKER_01]: trials at Cornell Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of you probably know that in
Geneva, there are fields that are
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated exclusively to research on
phytophthora blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris's lab uses those for many research
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a resource for breeders
around the country to conduct trials to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how their germplasm performs in
inoculated trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being Chris's student who worked on
phytophthora capsicidae, I also had the
[SPEAKER_01]: honor of managing some of these trials,
which was a really excellent learning
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was also something that we,
you know, there were challenges as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at this picture, you can see
my Latinate at the time, Ali, she's
[SPEAKER_01]: dumping phytophthora and infested
vermiculite into every single hole that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to transplant our Pepper
seedlings into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would then go back through like two or
three times over the next several weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and spray each plant with a suspension of
zoospores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, often by the end of the season,
we would have fields that look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders would want to come out and select
their most resistant plants, but
[SPEAKER_01]: everything would look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't always easy to get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to suspect that maybe because
of the isolate that we were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a typical result that we
would see with the isolate that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: been using.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've killed maybe 1,000 out of 2,500
plants, which I guess isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, some of the breeders we worked
with were frustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to see more differences and
select more plants, especially in their
[SPEAKER_01]: early generation material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2018, we decided to use a different
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk more about how we found that
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we actually had the opposite
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the season, only 150 of the
2,800 plants we put in that field had
[SPEAKER_01]: survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was obviously probably worse than the
result we had in the first case.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeders weren't able to select any
plants because all the plants were dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did we discover that isolate that
we inoculated that field with?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the winter between field seasons in
2017 and 2018, I went to the lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed 30 cultures somewhat randomly from
Chris's culture collection, inoculated
[SPEAKER_01]: them onto three different bell pepper
hybrids with different overall levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really amazed by how much variation
that we saw in terms of the disease caused
[SPEAKER_01]: by these isolates, ranging from strains
that were only able to kill a small number
[SPEAKER_01]: of the most susceptible variety to strains
that caused high levels of disease in all
[SPEAKER_01]: three of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including paladin, which is marketed in
zinc catalytic, so it's resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see here, where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0664-1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the strain we had been using in
field trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went all the way to the right side of
the plot to 1455 for the next year's
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: In hindsight, we probably should have gone
somewhere in the middle and not all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to the other extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a really interesting,
I guess, revelation for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that I got into plant breeding
was because I was so fascinated by
[SPEAKER_01]: theotypic diversity in crop plants and
vegetables especially, and to realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: there was all this theotypic diversity in
microbes as well, just really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to become more interested less
in the differences between plants and more
[SPEAKER_01]: in the differences between the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to know what was it about this
strain that enabled it to cause disease on
[SPEAKER_01]: paladin and this strain unable to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really lucky to have access to lots
of excellent resources in Chris's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a culture collection with hundreds
of isolates of phytophthora capsicidae.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had been previous grad students who
had worked on this pathogen and worked out
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the details that were needed to
do this experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris's student, Amara Dunn, developed
really excellent protocols for culturing
[SPEAKER_01]: and using inoculum and doing inoculations
with this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had experience with high-density
genotyping of phytophthora capsicidae.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those bioinformatic pipelines
were developed by Chris's student,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marin Carlson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to put these things together
and think about how to answer some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research questions I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, could we genotype maybe the
culture collection with high-density sniff
[SPEAKER_01]: markers, inoculate it onto a series of
different pepper varieties, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: identify markers associated with variation
virulence on these different pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we had to do was assemble
our culture collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these cultures we already had in
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had been collected at some point of
the previous 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris also had really excellent
relationships with growers and extension
[SPEAKER_01]: specialists who were able to go and
collect more strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually almost like a treasure
hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to Wegmans and finding a
rotting zucchini and bringing it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab and being amazed to pull phytophthora
capsicidae out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to expand this culture
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this plot, you can see the different
sites that the strains came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each circle is a different field,
and the size of the circle is proportional
[SPEAKER_01]: to how many strains we collected out of
that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also got a small number of strains from
other states as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We genotyped the strains with genotyping
by sequencing, which is a reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: representation whole genome sequencing
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to basically assay SNPs at
thousands of sites across the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we could do with this data
was we looked at the pairwise genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: similarity between all of our isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that and you make a histogram
of all those pairwise genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities, you get this tri-modal
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that is is that this peak here of
pairs of isolates that are least related
[SPEAKER_01]: to each other, these are isolates from
different field sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peak in the middle, these are isolates
that are genetically distinct but from the
[SPEAKER_01]: same field sites or related to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have this peak all the way at the
right, close to 100% genetic similarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That includes technical replicates of the
same isolate sequence multiple times,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also told us that pairs of isolates
that appear here are likely clonally
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from the same common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could use this to identify different
clonal groups of autophilic capsicy in our
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we found which made sense
with the biology of the pathogen was that
[SPEAKER_01]: every clonal group was unique to a
particular field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we expected given that the
asexual spores are very short-lived,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the sexual spores, the product of
meiosis, are the ones that overwinter from
[SPEAKER_01]: year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking at one isolate per clonal
group and looking at the population
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of this collection of isolates,
here if you look at the principal
[SPEAKER_01]: components analysis plot on the left and
the neighbor-joining tree on the right,
[SPEAKER_01]: the different colors represent different
regions of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different symbols within a color are
different field sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found was that in almost every
case, an isolate from a particular field
[SPEAKER_01]: site was more likely to be closely related
to another isolate from that same field
[SPEAKER_01]: site and to another isolate in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was even true at really small spatial
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at these purple triangles here
and these purple circles here,
[SPEAKER_01]: these came from two fields in Western New
York that were separated by about a mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that they're more closely
related to each other than they are to any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the other isolates that we sequenced,
but they're still totally differentiated
[SPEAKER_01]: from one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just this really interesting example
of how these pretty rare founder events of
[SPEAKER_01]: how these populations are introduced to
fields end up contributing to pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: strong genetic differentiation over time
through drift or selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that we found was evidence
of what seemed like a pretty widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomal copy number variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we could look at this was by
looking at read depths, sequencing read
[SPEAKER_01]: depths, and in particular, read depths for
heterozygous sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sequence heterozygous site,
on average, you should expect about half
[SPEAKER_01]: of the reads that you sequence to belong
to one allele and the other half to belong
[SPEAKER_01]: to the other allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some noise because of
sampling, but if you look at a histogram
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the sites, across the genome that
are heterozygous for a particular isolate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should expect normal distribution
centered around 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we saw for some of the
isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other isolates, we saw bimodal
distributions with peaks at 0.33 and 0.66.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are likely genome-wide triploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also saw evidence of tetraploids or
possible higher copy number isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a chromosome level reference
genome for Infectophytocapsacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there had been a genetic map published
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to anchor our SNP markers to
that genetic map to assign them to linkage
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, which you can think of essentially
as chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting to see that even
within a genome, we saw all this copy
[SPEAKER_01]: number variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this particular isolate here that I'm
showing, 16 of its chromosomes appear to
[SPEAKER_01]: be diploid, and then it has two
chromosomes that it seems to have three
[SPEAKER_01]: copies of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't really seem to be much patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the linkage groups we found to be
triploid or of a higher ploidy level than
[SPEAKER_01]: at least one isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find a couple of linkage groups
that had the highest incidence of higher
[SPEAKER_01]: ploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I think was interesting
about this was that it appears that this
[SPEAKER_01]: M-ploidy was mitotically derived as
opposed to meiotically derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that I think that is because
within a certain clonal group,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would find individual isolates that
would be aneuploid for a chromosome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that wouldn't be shared by other
isolates within that same clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like this widespread variation
arises very spontaneously and very rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: in populations of platotlerid capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We assay all of our isolates for mating
type by co-culturing them with isolates of
[SPEAKER_01]: known mating type and checking for the
presence of Ospores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that as a phenotype in a
genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the Manhattan plot here on
the x-axis, it's basically chromosomal
[SPEAKER_01]: location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, there'd be alternating colors
for chromosomes, but again, we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome-level assembly, so there's
scaffolds of the genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the y-axis, the negative log 10p
value, so the higher the point,
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher the association with that
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a strong peak on scaffold four,
this trait had been mapped by others in
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found the same result, a region on
scaffold four that determines mating type.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also corroborated previous results that
show that the A1 isolates had one
[SPEAKER_01]: haplotype at that location, and the A2
isolates had two haplotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed that mating type in phytophthora
capsicina, this has been shown in other
[SPEAKER_01]: old mice species, appears to be inherited
analogously to like an XY sex
[SPEAKER_01]: determination species such as an antigen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also assayed the isolates for
resistance to the fungicide methanoxin,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was used, I think, for the first
time in the 70s, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance showed up shortly after that in
old mice species.
[SPEAKER_01]: This trait hadn't been mapped before.
[SPEAKER_01]: In phytophthora capsicina, we found a
strong peak on scaffold 62.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had been assumed for a long time that
the target site of methanoxin was RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: polymerase III.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because methanoxin interferes with our
ribosomal RNA synthesis in old mice
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't find any genes annotated as
subunits of RNA polymerase III in that
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did find was this gene RRP5,
which is a gene involved in assembling
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-ribosomal RNA into ribosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to us like a pretty strong
candidate for the target site of
[SPEAKER_01]: methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we published this, actually a
crossing experiment in phytophthora
[SPEAKER_01]: infestans has implicated the same gene in
metal-axial resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GWAS results for mating type and
methanoxin resistance were very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very excited to use the same
approach for virulence on different pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to generate that phenotypic
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a subset of 117 isolates that were
genetically unique from our isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We challenged those onto 16 different
varieties of peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were both commercial hybrids and
lines that have been used by others as
[SPEAKER_01]: differentials for phytophthora capsicina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We evaluated plants for incidence of
mortality over time, turned that into
[SPEAKER_01]: AUDBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Altogether, this was about 1,900 unique
combinations of host and pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a bit of phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We repeated this twice for most
combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question is, were there
interactions between pathogen isolate and
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper variety or accession?
[SPEAKER_01]: The enrollment table says yes,
but it doesn't really tell us much about
[SPEAKER_01]: the nature of those interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to characterize the pattern of
those interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to visualize this in a couple of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at this plot, each subplot
represents a different isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the x-axis are the different pepper
varieties, increasing in order of
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptibility from left to right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In each plot, the black dashed line is the
average level of disease caused across all
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates on a particular pepper accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the red line is the level of disease
caused by that particular isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a lot to take in, but a couple of
things that we noticed looking at this
[SPEAKER_01]: data, one is that on average, the disease
caused by a particular isolate tends to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase with the overall susceptibility
of a pepper accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there were some cases where that
wasn't the case, like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we saw was that there was a
lot of variation between isolates that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from the same location.
[SPEAKER_01]: The background color of these plots
indicates what site they came from in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these blue isolates came from one
field, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at these dark green squares,
these were two different isolates that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from a squash field in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that one caused fairly average
levels of disease on all the pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This other isolate from the same location
caused very high levels of disease across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to find ways to characterize
this variation more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm trained as a plant breeder,
I turn to methods used in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I looked at is what we call
virulent stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is analogous to yield stability
analysis that's used by plant breeders in
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis of genotype by environment
interaction data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you evaluate different
varieties of a crop in different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can look at how stable the
performance of those varieties is across
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: By regressing the individual variety yield
on the average yield for each environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good example of this would be a variety
that's very responsive to fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That variety would have a very high slope
in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would perform very poorly in low
fertile environments, and it would perform
[SPEAKER_01]: very well in highly fertile environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a variety that's more stable would
just have a more intermediate performance
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that we looked at this,
we basically treated isolates as crop
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and pepper hosts as
environments, and regressed disease caused
[SPEAKER_01]: by individual isolates on the average
disease seen on the pepper varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that, you see that isolates
fall into one of three categories,
[SPEAKER_01]: low slope and low intercept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are isolates that cause low levels
of disease across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low intercept and high slope, those are
isolates that tend to cause average levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of disease on all of the pepper
accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then isolates with high intercept and low
slope, those are isolates that cause high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of disease on all peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells us something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another parameter that you can get from
this model is the means for error.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like how well can you predict the
disease caused by an isolate as a linear
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with the overall susceptible
of the host?
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, you can predict it very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most isolates have a low means for error,
but there were a few that had a really
[SPEAKER_01]: high means for error.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you couldn't really tell
what kind of disease it would cause in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper accession, knowing solely the
overall susceptibility level of that
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We next tried to look at the association
between pathogen subpopulation and these
[SPEAKER_01]: various phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I'm showing the principles of the
analysis of the molecular marker data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used clusters to assign isolates to one
of five clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we regressed virulence on each
individual pepper variety as a function of
[SPEAKER_01]: their assignment to those clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, what we found was that the
genetic subpopulation of isolate didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really influence how much disease it could
cause on most of these pepper varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the exception of red light,
the most susceptible pepper on average in
[SPEAKER_01]: our experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started looking at multivariate
phenotypes and we saw a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the principal components analysis
of the phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The matrix of disease outcome for all the
isolates on all of those different pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal components one and two explain
most of the variation in our dataset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal component one was very highly
correlated with just overall average
[SPEAKER_01]: virulence across all the pepper
accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't associated with subpopulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal component two was very highly
correlated with the slope from that
[SPEAKER_01]: stability analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The increase in virulence as a function of
pepper susceptibility also wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with subpopulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The principal component three had a very
strong association with pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: subpopulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here that along this X axis,
the noting principal component three,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the isolates belonging to genetic
cluster, the green cluster, fall on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left side of that axis and all the
isolates belonging to the blue cluster
[SPEAKER_01]: fall on the right side of that axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This principal component is more difficult
to interpret, but if you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: loadings of the individual pepper variety
variant, the isolates data on that
[SPEAKER_01]: principal component, the way I interpret
it, I'm not sure this is correct,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's basically measuring how much
disease the isolates cause on the
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate resistant pepper accessions
controlled by the disease causing the most
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible pepper accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the individual blocks
belonging to isolates with the most
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme values on that principal
component, so this would be that green dot
[SPEAKER_01]: over here and this isolate would be that
blue dot over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that this isolate causes lower
than average disease on the most resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: and most susceptible pepper variety,
but much higher than average disease on
[SPEAKER_01]: the intermediately resistant pepper
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this isolate causes higher than
average disease on the most susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: and the most resistant pepper variety,
but much lower than average disease on the
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediately resistant pepper varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant pepper varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what this means is that there are
host-specific virulence variants that
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the disease observed on these
intermediately resistant pepper varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can't really piece that out unless
you control for much larger effect
[SPEAKER_01]: variants affecting their ability to cause
disease on the most susceptible pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: extensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like we do with magentide
and fungicide sensitivity, we did a
[SPEAKER_01]: genome-wide association study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found four loci that were significantly
associated with virulence.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all cases, these four loci were
associated with broad-spectrum virulence,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the virulence allele at these loci
resulted in higher disease on all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper extensions that we tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't able to map any variants that
affected disease on only individual pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: extensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at the genes in the
regions of these hits, we found
[SPEAKER_01]: annotations that kind of supported a
virulence function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of close-ups of those
magentide-black peaks, and the track
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath shows gene annotations in
alternating colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red genes are RXLR-effector genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that in the case of the peak on
scaffold 39, the peak state was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these effectors seems like pretty
strong support that this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's actual virulence function for this
hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to scaffold 37, although more in
the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple sequences are polygalacteronase
gene annotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So genes involved in cell wall
degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of the hit scaffold 93,
we saw that there was a cluster of genes
[SPEAKER_01]: annotated as having a polygalacteronase
role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what's the make of these results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we generated a lot of
data, and I kind of scratched our heads
[SPEAKER_01]: and tried to tell some story about it and
make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the actual practical
implications?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for one thing, we showed that,
you know, GMARS works pretty well for
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate gene identification and sexually
reproducing pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed that both for the magentide,
for the fungicide sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the case of this larger effect,
virulence loci, that affected all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper extensions in our experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, other breeders and pathologists
use the terminology physiological races to
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to phytophthora capsulci
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the set of isolates and the set
of pepper accessions we included in our
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment, I'm not sure I would use that
terminology to me that implies like large
[SPEAKER_01]: effect qualitative gene for gene
interactions that influence the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: or absence of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw evidence for much smaller
quantitative gene for gene interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: that influence relative disease levels on
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the best way is to
classify, you know, isolates or strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the data that we observed,
I don't think there is an easy way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but physiological races I think maybe
is an oversimplification.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, you know, maybe with a
different set of isolates, different set
[SPEAKER_01]: of host gene types, we would have had
different conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like I said, we were able to
identify virulence variants with medium to
[SPEAKER_01]: large effect across all of the pepper
hosts in our experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that there were variants that had
an effect on individual pepper varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we couldn't pick those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably were just underpowered because
of relatively small sample sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of implications for pepper
breeding, you know, if I was a pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder, what would I do knowing this
information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would just treat the resistance
to different strains like a correlated
[SPEAKER_01]: trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in terms of screening early
generation lines, I'd probably evaluate
[SPEAKER_01]: them against one isolate, one strain of
the pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I move forward and evaluate
more advanced lines, I would test them
[SPEAKER_01]: against an increased number of isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how am I going to take this like
background and move forward as an eggplant
[SPEAKER_01]: and tomato breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to do this in like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really just depends on a case
by case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an example, tomato leaf mold is a
disease that's really important in our
[SPEAKER_01]: region in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a disease that has been very
well characterized by molecular plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many R genes and A virulence loci in the
fungus have been cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here there's very strong evidence of,
you know, very clear qualitative gene for
[SPEAKER_01]: gene interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked a little bit on this as a grad
student in a project led by my lab mate,
[SPEAKER_01]: Martha Sudermey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We characterized isolates from around the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Race typed in, we determined that
everything that we found were races zero
[SPEAKER_01]: and two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato breeders tend to use one resistance
gene, CF9, and resistance breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs that works against those races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the time being, I think resistant
variety should hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's also prudent to maybe
determine additional resistance genes as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, anticipating breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: My predecessor in my position,
Martha Mutchler, did a lot of excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: work on early blight and sartorial leaf
spot, identified new sources of resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: to these diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really nothing known about the
population structure of the fungi that
[SPEAKER_01]: caused these diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they reproduce sexually?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much variation is there between
strains in the same field, between fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the resistance hold up equally to
different strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really a lot of unknowns,
and I think a lot of information that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be valuable there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lab is also working on verticillium
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I ask eggplant growers and extension
agents what the biggest problem in
[SPEAKER_01]: eggplant is, if I ask 10 people,
they all tend to tell me the same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is verticillium, which is good to
hear as a breeder so I can focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no resistance available to
verticillium in eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In tomato, verticillium has been
controlled for, I don't know, 50 or 80
[SPEAKER_01]: years with a single gene, VE, that's been
overcome in other parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if there's VE strains that
overcome VE in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a valuable question to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also don't know how much that doesn't
matter for eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there association between virulence of
eggplant, virulence of tomato?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's important questions to
answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: To conclude, as a vegetable breeder moving
forward, I don't think for every single
[SPEAKER_01]: disease I work on, I'm going to test my
breeding lines against 100 strains of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, but I think there are some
important lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scale of the skull pathogen monitoring
characterization depends on the particular
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of tomato leaf mold,
it might be monitoring for individual
[SPEAKER_01]: avirulence genes that are already cloned
that we know will allow them to overtake
[SPEAKER_01]: that deployed R gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of septoria and early blight,
I think there's much more fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: information that needs to be uncovered
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect to do any of this by
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really look forward to collaborating
with pathologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing I'm really interested in
is coordinating networks to test germplasm
[SPEAKER_01]: in geographically diverse locations,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one thing we can do is do
artificial inoculations in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: with different strains of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can also just test germplasm in
different locations and rely on natural
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculum and look at how durable
resistance is with that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd like to thank all the
people who contributed to my PhD research
[SPEAKER_01]: that I talked about today, as well as the
members of my lab currently, Arlene Bion,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameron Downey, Howard Rice, and Ivana
Castillo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll be happy to answer any
questions if there's any time left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the room here, and then we'll
go to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much sexual reproduction occurs in the
field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much in, so the question for Zoom
was how much sexual reproduction occurs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field with phytophthora capsicum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost in every case when we sample
strains from the field, we identify both
[SPEAKER_01]: mating types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genotypic data also supports,
you know, very frequent sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to be the case that both
mating types are present and sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction is necessary for
overwintering, which we see as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I'd like to say that the graph
of the subplots of the pebbler results we
[SPEAKER_00]: found the best representation of the data
that I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, across the pebbler line,
do you have a sense of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygosity?
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, in the different pebbler
lines that we tested, how much
[SPEAKER_01]: heterozygosity is present in those lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used a mixture of commercial hybrids
and open-pollinated pebbler varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commercial hybrids should be pretty
homogeneous, and we saw pretty consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of the open-pollinated varieties
that we included, we did see more variable
[SPEAKER_01]: results, and there could be some
heterogeneity within those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question from Ricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think sparse testing methods would
help alleviate the experimental
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints of challenging all gene types
by all isolates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the level of pathogen
variation in the observable field will
[SPEAKER_01]: hinder this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the way that we say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another question,
and that is that when we see the history
[SPEAKER_01]: of plant breeding, breeders have been
pretty successful in breeding from disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, even though they have little
knowledge of the type of isolates they
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: From this, can we conclude that they have
been mostly selected for broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does this interaction carry over
in time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I would say that there are
many cases of breeders deploying a
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance gene, and that resistance gene
lasting for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also many cases of breeders
deploying a gene and it lasting a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think both of those things have been
observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the last question is from Marina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you elaborate a little on possible
pros or cons of using scaffold-level
[SPEAKER_01]: sequences for GWAS rather than chromosomal
level?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had chromosome-level assembly,
that would be preferable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visually, it's nicer, and then we can also
identify whether different hits are linked
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard with many very small
scaffolds that could actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically very closely linked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's it for the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Bill might have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there no sexual reproduction in the
phytophthora plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there sexual reproduction in the Geneva
phytophthora plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Chris in the past has
intentionally inoculated that field with
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple mating types with the intention
of really studying how allele frequencies
[SPEAKER_01]: change over time in a sexually reproducing
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for field trials, we intend to
inoculate only with one mating type,
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping not to contribute to long-lasting
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those trials, there's no risk of
sexual population?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all of our best efforts to contain
pathogens, they find a way to spread
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have one more question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that massive study that looked at the
range of isosceles over the several poses,
[SPEAKER_00]: how stable were those aggressiveness or
appearance?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an excellent question, and I
apologize for not repeating the earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, how stable were the
phenotypes, the aggressiveness levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the isolates?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question,
and one that I didn't talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found generally was that the lowly
and the kind of intermediately aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates were stable across different
replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the isolates that tended to cause very
high levels of disease on all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: peporexcessions, those were the least
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would inoculate with a strain,
and we would see very severe plant death.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be able to repeat that maybe a few
times, and then it would lose its
[SPEAKER_01]: virulence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of spontaneous
variation like that in phytophthora
[SPEAKER_01]: species, and we heard a little bit about
that last week in terms of fungicide
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of interesting
questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to thank you again,
Greg, for an excellent presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has
[SPEAKER_02]: been a production of Cornell University on
the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
