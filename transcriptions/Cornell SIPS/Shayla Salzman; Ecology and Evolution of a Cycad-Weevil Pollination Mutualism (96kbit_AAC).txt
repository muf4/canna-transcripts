[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if this microphone works right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell everyone that the moment I
first heard of psych heads changed my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first time I get to say
this in the room with Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first heard of psych heads in her
plant morphology course at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said at the end of that,
she was talking about all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things that I'm going to tell you
about about psych heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, if you're more interested,
you should go read Island of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorblind by Oliver Sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally stopped on the way home at
the UC Berkeley library, which did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have it, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to check Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stopped at the Berkeley city
library and got that book that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely was a change in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've fallen in love with psych heads ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is that I've always been
interested in plant insect interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly from an agricultural
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is working a lot in
sustainable agriculture before Chelsea
[SPEAKER_00]: changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelsea changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to start with this
picture for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that right off the bat,
I'm used to speaking to really diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their first question is,
what is a psych head?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like this picture because it tells
you a couple important things about the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psych heads are gymnosperms, which I don't
have to tell this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that they have cones as their
reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also daecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the female cones or the ovulate cones
are housed on separate plants than the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen cones or the male cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am looking at a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at all of these cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I love this picture because it
tells a story that matters to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at a field season in Florida that
I went with my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my wedding ring that was
subsequently stolen when I was mugged in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil at the evolution conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those two things, thinking
about relationships and thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: history and the importance of
relationships and thinking about these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, really come together to give a
good introduction to what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about today and really what I talk
about always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that relationships are inherently
interesting to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say that's evidenced by the
success of every ridiculous romantic
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy movie ever made, no matter how
silly the storyline or insane the outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a lot of sense to me
because we're curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are innately curious to answer
questions about these relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some examples of movies that
I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If none of you have ever seen this or read
the book, This is Lonesome Dove,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an amazing epic miniseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about me deeply,
this movie sort of end book influences my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a handmade purse of Lonesome
Dove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, I'll go watch it when you're
sick because it's like six hours long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're curious about how did we get here
and where are we going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we help each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this relationship even work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does someone have to change for this
relationship to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that we're curious about
when we're watching this media depictions
[SPEAKER_00]: of human relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, all organisms engage in a
diverse range of interactions with other
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms, ranging from the obvious
predation and pollination or even
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivory, even of highly toxic plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To some that are a little less obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Acacia drepanelobium or Vicella
drepanelobium and they're ant mutualists.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants make these dematia that the
ants are housed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, on one tree will be an entire
ant colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: That literally protects them from giraffes
and elephants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mutualism that we might not know
as much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this, which kind of looks gross to a
room of not insect biologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are butterfly caterpillars,
butterfly larvae, and they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fingaris is the genus name, and their
entire life is dependent on host ants
[SPEAKER_00]: finding them in the wild, on the ground,
finding them and taking them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: nest where these guys parasitize the ant
colony by being fed from the ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a highly specialized
relationship that the lineage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the evolutionary lineage of this organism
is dependent on a mutualism, a parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, everyone knows this one,
I'm assuming, in this room with lichen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also put this up, this is
cyanobacteria, but really just to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting more and more knowledge
about how bacteria is important in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways in our world from changing behavior
and changing dietary outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we wanted to ask those same
questions in a biological framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might use a little bit more science-y
sounding questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might ask instead, what is the
evolutionary trajectory?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of symbiosis are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: What mechanisms work to keep us together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And has there been any evolutionary
innovation in this relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I study that in cycads, specifically
because cycads have highly specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with both pollinators and
herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are one-to-one relationships
where the pollinators live their entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle on the plant, and the plant is
dependent on reproduction on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a lot more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have a lot of highly
specialized herbivore relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Eumaecetala butterflies that,
as you can see, because they aggregate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do great damage to the plant,
and their entire life cycle is dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: on the host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also study cycads because they're
just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had someone reviewing a paper once,
not at the review stage, but a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborator reviewing a paper saying,
you should really be careful and not
[SPEAKER_00]: assume that everyone loves cycads,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should all think about that in writing
your papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just assume everyone loves your
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, what is wrong with our world
if you don't love cycads?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take just a few minutes to
convince you all that cycads are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, they are just incredibly
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are photographs that my husband took
at Montgomery Botanical Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put these in not just to show you the
beautiful diversity, but also to point out
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycads are highly endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most endangered group of plants in the
world, most ranged from threatened to
[SPEAKER_00]: endangered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Montgomery Botanical Center is a
conservation garden down in Florida that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows ex-situ groupings of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just another picture that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also demand your attention in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some field work I was doing in
Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's screaming for your attention and the
attention of herbivores, I should point
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, they have an incredible fossil
record extending back over 265 million
[SPEAKER_00]: years, some with this incredible level of
cellular diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are an ancient plant lineage,
265 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like I have to say that a
few times to really drive this home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of information that we
can learn from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: From their fossil record that hopefully
I'll learn more about with Liz,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning a little bit with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is also just kind of interesting
to me because the United States used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a fossil national park, a cycad
fossil national monument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the very few national
monuments in the history of the US that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ever been decommissioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because of theft of the fossils
that actually most of the theft was done
[SPEAKER_00]: by this George Weiland, which is this Yale
paleontologist that really worked to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of fossils of cycads and
their related plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an interesting side note
that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cycads are also thermogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that they have their own
body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own body temperature way
of heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do this in their reproductive
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually really quite rare in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it is found in plants,
it's usually that there is either one big
[SPEAKER_00]: burst of temperature increase or like an
increase and then sort of maintenance at
[SPEAKER_00]: one level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycads, however, have an even more
interesting pattern, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They increase in heat up in their
temperature over the course of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day for about two weeks when the
plant's reproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in both the pollen cones and in
the ovulate cones and to a much less
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in the ovulate cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something you might think of as
like an animal trait body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have another thing that
people tend to think of as an animal
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have mobile sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have flagellated sperm that are also
gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally see these with the naked
eye, which is a really fun thing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that we should do in coursework,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to prove that they are the end
all be all, they have an omega patterning
[SPEAKER_00]: in their leaf rachis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love this because I had this really
crazy, and this is probably inappropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, but slightly drunken night at
Montgomery Botanical Center where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to a girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was somebody there that is an artist
from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was there doing art based on sort
of botanical representation in religious
[SPEAKER_00]: ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she and I got a little tipsy together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, what if cycads are
God?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're not the alpha and the
omega, but they certainly have omega
[SPEAKER_00]: patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are actually used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of religious connotation
in indigenous cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of anthropology work that
goes back and looks at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the Aztec maize god,
the Aztec corn god, they believe is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a movement beyond an evolution
from a cycad worship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that cycad consumption could
have been important for the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of great information about
the history of cycads in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are still used in a lot of
religious ceremonies, specifically where
[SPEAKER_00]: Catholicism has taken in some indigenous
religious connotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that's a little more
important for our story is that cycads are
[SPEAKER_00]: super toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have two classes of toxins I'm
just going to call BMAA and MAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: These toxins are mutagenic, neurotoxic,
and carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're present in all cycad genera
and in all cycad tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effects of their toxicity have
been recorded in insects and animals and
[SPEAKER_00]: even plants, which is amazing if you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a talk for another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, famously has been
discussed in Oliver Sacks' book,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Island of the Colorblind, where he
really connected consumption of cycad
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins with neurodegenerative diseases of
the people of Guam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this is still a very active
area of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the toxin BMAA and its connections to
ALS and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of medical research
that's still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have, besides their specialized
relationships with insects, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: other specialized relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of the stuff that Chelsea
first told me about that blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some specialized morphology to
make their association with cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have these choleroid roots,
which you may not be able to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a depotted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you've got sort of a choleroid
root growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some, if you see in a root ball,
me holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut one of those root nodules open,
you'll see a ring of cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some ongoing work down at
Longibio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really working out that it's
not just cyanobacteria that's present in
[SPEAKER_00]: these roots, that there are other
bacteria, and that the interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: between those different bacteria can do
different things with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the hypothesis has always
been, obviously, that cyanobacteria is
[SPEAKER_00]: fixing nitrogen for cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, that has not yet been
proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, however, am really, I think of myself
as a symbiosis biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested under this umbrella of
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really think a lot about
mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing is just a pure mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a mutualistic relationship
with your partner or your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me, there are some parasitic
aspects of that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to really understand
mutualism, you need to also think about
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in cycads, there are very clear
distinctions that allow me to ask those
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the pollinator mutualist that I'm
going to talk a lot about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to give you some
insights that I've gotten from the
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic herbivores that allow me to
understand a little bit more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm interested in here is
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand how does this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this relationship work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start by saying that specialized
pollination is widespread in cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a long standing time, we thought
that cycads were wind pollinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the presence of insects had
been found on the cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now believe that all cycads appear
to be obligately insect pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it seems to mostly be
coleoptera, which is the order that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes beetles and weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found across the phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some recent fossil evidence even dates
that to before the rise of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a fossil that shows us where
this beetle has already evolved morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: that is specific to its relationship with
cycads and living within cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I study the genus Xamia, which is
neotropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one species native to Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest grows through the
Caribbean, down through Central and South
[SPEAKER_00]: America, Mexico, and all the way down to
Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I study this because it's easy,
because it's here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier, especially because these
are endangered plants and societies
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also because of some great work done
by two different group of researchers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s studying two different groups of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were working on the pollination
of those plants and really challenging the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that these are wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those researchers both found that they
were pollinated by these genus of weevil,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ropilotreia weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were different species of
Ropilotreia weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found also that within a common
garden, they were working at Fairchild
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanical Center and slash Montgomery
Botanical Center, or Fairchild Botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden, that the weevil stayed faithful to
their host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those groups of researchers went
even further and worked out the life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Ropilotreia weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just walk you through it,
and then I'll show you some of my own
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures to give you a little bit more
connection with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a large male plant with pollen
cones all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weevils aggregate on the outside of a
pollen cone at a certain stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the cone, a little bit
before the cone opens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they begin feeding inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lay their eggs on it on a microspore
fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to call it a cone scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they lay their eggs inside the
microspore fill, inside the cone scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae develop inside, hollowing it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one encounters the other, he
cannibalizes it and then pupates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock of the cone scale, where he then
emerges and does the process all over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of their pollination work,
we knew that they visited the female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They visited the ovulate cones,
but they never feed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never aggregate their enlarged
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't lay their eggs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't develop on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was still an unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did they visit the female plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this relationship is so specialized
and important, in fact, that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: only have reproductive cones for about one
and a half to two months a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rest of the 10 months of the year,
the weevils are in diapause, which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: think of as like arrested development or
hibernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes to Florida to hibernate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where people go to retire because
it's comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where girls gone wild,
spring break stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is going there to retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so for 10 months out of the year,
these weevils find Florida too
[SPEAKER_00]: inhospitable for them, because their life
cycle is so tied to their host plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when there's a closely related host
plant a meter away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some of my own pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a bunch of cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell, but this cone here has
a lot of weevils all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them just aggregating like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break this cone open, you'll see a
lot of frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weevil poop and nibble marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a weevil covered in pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a cone and you open it
up, you see a little weevil standing on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of a microspore fill with the pollen
sacs above him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's a female cone that is
cracked open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a cone is receptive, it goes from
being tightly bound to cracking open to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, in trying to understand this
connection, why do they leave this house,
[SPEAKER_00]: this great home that gives them everything
they need?
[SPEAKER_00]: All their friends are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your mom's house when you're a
teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go out into the world on your
own and you have to feed yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did your mom do to kick you out of
the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we get them out of this house?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it has something to do with
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a little bit of reason to think
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two other really well-known
obligate brood site pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms, which means that the insect is
housed and its brood develops within the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive tissue of the plant that it
pollinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that you guys have all
probably heard of are the yucca and the
[SPEAKER_00]: yucca moth and the fig and the fig wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm doing it in something that doesn't
have a flower, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it has something to do
with chemical communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I started working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank God I got lucky because it meant
I got to get a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started by asking, what is the
plant's signal?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is communication 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what your therapist will talk to
you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your signal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your partner perceive the signal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is their behavioral response to
the signal that you give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the plant use that to enact
reproduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does your communication result in the
desired behavior or the desired outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're hoping for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started by asking, what's the plant's
signal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, I do headspace collection
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have here is a de-hissing pollen
cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm taking volatiles from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a inert plastic bag over it,
literally a Reynolds oven bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: tied off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This filter here has absorbent material in
it and a vacuum pulling over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 45 minutes, I'm pulling the air
space around the cone over this absorbent
[SPEAKER_00]: material to get the smell that the plant
is producing, the volatile bouquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I then elute and run on something
called gas chromatography mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometry, which is very simply just a
way to separate all of the 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds the plant may be producing,
so that I can ask questions about each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do that, I find that the plant that
I'm studying, Xamia ferferaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the one that had had all of that
great pollination work done already in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants really produce two main
volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I identified as 1,3-octidine,
and one that I identified as linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the plant signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant really only has two channels
that it's communicating through,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't tell me what the insect
perceives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insects are different than humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smell everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects have sort of like a lock and key
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have proteins in their antennae that
you could think of as the lock,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the volatile is the key, that it has
to come in and match, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To close that lock, to fit into that
protein in order for the insect to
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the fact that the plant produces
both of these doesn't tell me what the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect perceives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, I do something called
electroantennagraph detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that GCMS that I talked about,
what separates all the volatile compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can ask questions about each of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm doing here is I'm separating
those volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending half to be detected and
produce that same image that you just saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: having the peaks at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other half is coming down this
tube and being bathed across this prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is, is two electrodes,
and that's a weevil's little head that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just chopped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his head is on one side, and antennae
on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the volatile comes and bathes
across that, that's the key that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the lock, closes the lock,
and it closes this electrical circuit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it creates an electrical charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm coupling that with the other
analyses, I'm able to identify which of
[SPEAKER_00]: those compounds the insect perceives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what that data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that exact same image over top,
and on the bottom, here's my electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, and then here's the dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weevil physiologically can perceive
1,3-octidine and cannot perceive linalool,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a much more common plant
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 1,3-octidine is not very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in a couple other cycads,
really, in Africa, of all places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tells me the physiological
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you have to do this many
times, and to really identify this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to, this compound, there's many
things that go behind it, but you really
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have a chemist synthesize this
standard and test the weevil against that
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the same as linalool,
and all the different chymers of linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're positive that this weevil
perceives 1,3-octidine and nothing else
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't tell me what the
behavioral response is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me what the insect is capable
of perceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, I did something called
pitfall test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got these pea tree dishes with a
whole cut in the middle and a pit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the bottom, I'm putting different
concentrations of 1,3-octidine and a
[SPEAKER_00]: control, of course, and I put some weevils
in the top, close the lid, put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: darks, there's no visual signaling going
on, and I come back after 30 minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how many weevils have fallen into the
pit, telling me, is this an attractant?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of compounds can be deterrents for
weevils, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that you know this because
you put different chemicals in to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put chemicals in to keep mice out of
the barn, and you put chemicals down to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep insects out of places, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They act, chemicals can be an attractant
or deterrent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do that, I see it and do it a
bunch of times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that it is an attractant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number, this is the proportion
of weevils that have gone down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pit and all of the different
concentrations or amounts, base amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that it is an
attractant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's nothing in very low amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an attractant, but it is not linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think that just if you really
liked something, you know, the more of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more attracted you are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, you love donuts, is that
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more donuts, the more attracted you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get up to a point where too much
donuts is unattractive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tells me, it tells me that this is
an attractant, but not linearly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me think maybe this has
something to do with what causes the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement from the pollen cone to the
ovulate cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, I want to ask, can I elicit
movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I cause insect movement using these
two different concentrations, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologically relevant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These two different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I do something where I build
these arenas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you've got here is a box arena
with a bunch of weevils in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sides are all mesh so that there
is airflow, so there's no like buildup of
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one side, I may put the volatile
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, the 1,3-octidine
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, I put a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put nothing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to track these weevils
over time and see if their location
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they more attracted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they move towards the lower
concentration and away from the higher
concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always think it's such a fun video.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just tracking them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, some various important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a weevil doesn't move at all,
they're not counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is the compound and they're
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can very easily do that using
pixels, understanding that you take an
[SPEAKER_00]: average pixel density at this location
throughout the course of the video and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do that, and I'm saying,
I'm looking at their change in asymmetry,
[SPEAKER_00]: their change in direction towards the
bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that, yes, at this lower amount,
they are attracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move towards the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the higher amount, they move away from
the bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean, though,
for how plants use that, that weevil
[SPEAKER_00]: behavioral preference for their volatiles,
to enact reproduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I had done in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cones will continue to
undergo at least their thermogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even we know that cone scales are able
to continue producing volatiles throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of the day if they're broken
off from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had taken broken off cone scales from
pollen cones and ovulate cones,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 of each, arranged them in this arena,
had it so that air could flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this, introduced four weevils into
a circular arena with the pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the pollen cone scale or an
ovulate cone scale in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just attract them all day and
said, how many are on the cone scale or
[SPEAKER_00]: within one little millimeter of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from this that there's
definitely, they're more attracted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen cone scale than to the ovulate cone
scale, and that there is this big dip in
[SPEAKER_00]: attraction in the pollen cone scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a statistically significant
dip in the female cone scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, this is a lab setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know how much of this dip
in either case is related to the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: these are broken off cone scales or what
it may mean, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that I at least see some
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a difference in attraction to
pollen and ovulate cones and also a big
[SPEAKER_00]: dip in attraction to pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go back to the plants, and I take
volatiles the same way I told you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do it every hour for pollen cones
and for ovulate cones, every hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: and watch how those volatiles change
throughout the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I notice is that there is
a characteristic pattern in both pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: cones and ovulate cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen cones are in blue here,
ovulate cones are in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing is the percent
composition of 1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm looking at now,
not even linalool, which obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the other compound,
it does an opposite shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see is that there's a real
dip in production of 1,3-octidine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the day, and then they approach
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not overall accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the total amount that they
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they are producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce these two compounds,
and they shift to making only 1,3-octidine
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the evening, a little after 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see also that pollen cones on
average produce overall more volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is both 1,3-octidine and linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do they produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at total ion abundance,
which is a value that I get from GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen cones again in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen cones produce more than ovulate
cones, and they have some peak at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that peak related to 1,3-octidine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar graph, but this is now
looking just at 1,3-octidine, not at
[SPEAKER_00]: overall volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the pollen cones produce more
1,3-octidine and have a big increase at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day in 1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so at the same time that I'm taking
these volatile measurements every hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also videotaping cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got all these pollen cones,
10 of them, that I've broken off and put
[SPEAKER_00]: in these little plastic containers with
airflow in them, and I videotape them all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just literally go and count how
many weevils are in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many weevils are in the container,
which means out of the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see is that at this time that I
have this big increase, percent increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in production of 1,3-octidine in the
pollen cones, that's the same time that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big expulsion of pollinators from
the pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm counting, and it's like 2,
2, 2, 2, 40, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some massive movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that I'm just not
technologically advanced enough to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to take, like, a 10-hour video and break
it down into 30 seconds for you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's insanely striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're just watching, and there's
nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's just a million weevils,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our idea here is that I'm gonna break
this down and just use two, one pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: cone and one ovulate cone to make it a
little bit clearer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our idea here is that there is
difference in concentration that is
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive to the pollinator and that the
plants use their daily patterning as a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to move the pollinators between the pollen
cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost as if there's this low
level of production of 1,3-octidine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this looks like zero, but it's
slightly above, that's just not really
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive to the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to get them to move or get
them to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's a window that is
attractive to them, an amount that they
[SPEAKER_00]: like and an amount that they don't like,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I always describe this is,
my husband, I love it if he has a little
[SPEAKER_00]: aftershave on, but I cannot stand cologne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all been next to this person on
the elevator and you want to get off as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast as you can, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing that the weevils are
doing, we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just schematically, that would look a
little something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pollen cone here on the left,
an ovulate cone here on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your increase in production of
1,3-octidine, sort of as a heat map,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can imagine that over that daily
cycle, there's an amount that is
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive to weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy and they hate to hang out in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they get on the elevator with Mr.
Stinky and they've got to get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that works for them,
because their entire life is bound to this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant, that smell, is where they're
going to lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where they're going to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where they're going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to mate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Their larvae are going to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have no desire to find anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once they're pushed out of this
cone, they're sort of pulled into this
[SPEAKER_00]: cone, sort of deceptively, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A cheat mechanism, because there's no food
here for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe, and so in this case,
this is still an unknown to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this one consistent amount,
or is there sort of a, it appears from
[SPEAKER_00]: this data, and it appears that what's
happening is the female cone is making not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be attractive, but is becoming
attractive at the same time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen cone is becoming repulsive,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the earlier data showing them in
the lab, it seemed like maybe the female
[SPEAKER_00]: cone is being pretty consistent throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, I think we should work out a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually called push-pull
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been described in one other
species, or one other genus, one species,
[SPEAKER_00]: period, but it's in a different genus,
macrosamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And macrosamia have pollinators that are
thrips, vastly, vastly different from
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the same pollination
mechanism exists in macrosamia and
[SPEAKER_00]: insamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that that thermogenic
patterning that I told you about produces
[SPEAKER_00]: a similar volatile patterning,
like I'm showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that it's not just that an
increase in temperature makes you more
[SPEAKER_00]: stinky, it's actually that the substrates
that are necessary for volatile production
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced during the thermogenic
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're able to test and see that
it's predictable that there's a pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have a peak in thermogenesis,
and about 10 to 30 minutes later,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a peak in volatile production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that everywhere that it's
been tested in cycads, every time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been tested, we have this volatile
patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we know that thermogenesis
is ancestral in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really suggests to us that because
every cycad has brood site mutualists,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the organisms live within the pollen
cone, and that every pollen cone undergoes
[SPEAKER_00]: this thermogenesis that we know creates
this volatile patterning, we think that
[SPEAKER_00]: this pollination mechanism may be
ancestral in this group, and in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: may be a pollination mechanism that
existed before the visual signal that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get with the rise of flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a brief summary of that little
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they only perceive
1,3-octidine, and that it's both a
[SPEAKER_00]: repellent and an attractant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plants change that amount
throughout the course of the day in a
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable pattern, and that that can
enact weevil movement between the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: cone and the ovulate cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this push-pull pollination mechanism
is likely ancient, and has existed long
[SPEAKER_00]: before the rise of flowering plants,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in still understanding mechanisms,
I need to bring in this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitism, because these pollinators are
herbivores of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are super toxic,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to understand that,
one of the first things I did was look at
[SPEAKER_00]: a phylogeny of Lepidoptera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lepidoptera is the order that includes
butterflies and moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may come as a massive surprise to
you, because it totally blew my mind as
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from a plant background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butterflies are nested within moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not two separate monophyletic
groups, which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this black is butterflies, and all of
the gray are moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've colored on the tips here,
where we have evolutions of cycadivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, they are radiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're genera that have radiated onto
cycads and have eight to 20 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most cases, so all of these guys,
which include butterflies and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: moths, these large herbivores that feed on
leaves, there's aposematic coloring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be as obvious in this one,
but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not see any aposematic coloring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aposematic just means that they have
warning coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I'm super bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat me, because I'm toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know a little bit about this one
here, that it does sequester the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins, that it uses them in their own
body for defense against herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys down here are all detritivores,
which means that they feed on dead tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's possible that they're feeding
on dead cones, where some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical compounds, these toxins,
may have already been leached from that
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what's going on with these
little guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at this gives me the idea that
cycadivory has evolved many times,
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's more likely?
[SPEAKER_00]: That they all got the same ability to feed
on toxic cycads, or that they acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: some ability to feed on toxic cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that, in order to understand
the mechanisms, I thought I would look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about what gut bacteria does
and how it's related to diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought maybe these guys all have
shared gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess these are my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there shared gut bacteria amongst
herbivores of cycad tissues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, can we infer anything from the
function?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, what I first did was I took
herbivores from, this is in three
[SPEAKER_00]: different species of Xamia and three
different locations in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one species of Cycus in
Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took leaf herbivores, cone herbivores,
and there's two different, this guy only
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds on the microspore field,
this one only feeds on the cone peduncle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this guy that feeds on the stem,
the underground stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just very basically asked,
what is the bacterial community of these
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivores?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything shared?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, you do something 16S
sequencing, you sequence all the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in their guts and identify them sort of
like ITS, like an eye tag for bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just looked at it with a
diversity analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I see that stands out
is that bacterial communities are
[SPEAKER_00]: generally distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is any individual of this species
its gut bacterial community is more
[SPEAKER_00]: closely similar to other gut bacterial
communities of the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is totally expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect phylogeny to have an
influence on gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also look at the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that last image was every bacteria in
the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you yourselves may have 200 species of
bacteria in your gut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I took the gut bacterial community
of everyone in this room, and everyone had
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 species, and I asked, what's the core?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are bacteria that are found in the
guts of all humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that there are three species,
or 10 species, or 15 species that are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in every single one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I did for each one of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing you see is that six
species here, and then large ones for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, again, not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from the literature that
butterflies in general have really
[SPEAKER_00]: transient bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have really a core bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beetles usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's interesting to me
is that these guys are feeding on leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this guy is feeding on a microspore
fill, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little more similar than some of
the other tissue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's feeding on a stem and a cone
penuncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I look at all of those,
I find that there are five shared bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all of them, which is also super
interesting when you think that these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: only have six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five of their six are found in all
other cycad herbivores, and not in related
[SPEAKER_00]: non-cycad species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are feeding out groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I infer anything about this
function?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, just a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to identify one to species,
one to genus, and then two to families,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one totally unidentified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get some information about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these two both do nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that Pantawea can be involved in
toxin degradation and protein hydrolysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is particularly interesting,
because BMAA is a non-protein amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is get into, well,
one of the things it does is get into your
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and change the conformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have this interesting
anti-cancer capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this is used, this bacteria
is found in earthworms and is used in
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese medicine related to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has, I'm gonna have to read it so I
don't get it wrong, cytotoxicity and
[SPEAKER_00]: apoptotic and necrotic death of mammalian
cancer cells due to the activity of a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein polysaccharide complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us some interesting idea
that maybe these bacteria are involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ability to feed on toxic cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting enough to us that we
went and did this even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that previous study was published,
but it was interesting enough that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 12 species now of herbivores from
all across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was your idea for this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, so I hope you all
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you can see we have all different
feeding tissues and across different
[SPEAKER_00]: genera of cycads and from different
geographies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those five shared bacteria are still
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with some colleagues down at
Longhibio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working out the function of these
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have cultured insects gut bacteria
that I brought them from, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: cultured them in the presence and absence
of BMAA, one of the toxins, grown them up
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have then separately individually
cultured bacteria and sequenced their
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working just this week even on
that publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finding some pretty interesting
stuff understanding the function that
[SPEAKER_00]: these bacteria may be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have time to get into it
today, so maybe for further time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there is a core microbiome
of feeding on cycad plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it may allow in some way,
maybe, maybe it's just transient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the cycads in this gut bacteria is
selecting for this and has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the insects, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the first evidence of
convergence of a gut bacterial community
[SPEAKER_00]: across a diverse set of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That share a common host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back to our questions that
we're interested in, in relationships,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can ask them about cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can think about what is the
evolutionary trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that I'm here
working on with Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a little bit about the
evolutionary history of cycads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there's just this really
amazing phylogeny where the lineages
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves are quite ancient, but the
genera have all recently radiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a published phylogeny of
Xamia, the genus that I study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know anything about the
evolutionary history of anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this mutualism network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the evolutionary history of
the pollinators, of the butterflies,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at an evolution of a
mutualism network as a whole and not as
[SPEAKER_00]: individual players, and understanding how
those relationships have evolved over time
[SPEAKER_00]: and how there may be correlations that,
or what correlations may exist that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been unaware of until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understanding some of the
morphology that may be associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: these relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of symbiosis are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems pretty obvious that the
pollinators are mutualists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide reproductive services to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't set seed unless the
pollinators are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they feed on essentially disposable
tissue, just cone tissue that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: die and rot away after the reproductive
event anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, there's a little bit of
parasitism in every relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: which my husband doesn't like when I say,
but oh my god, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys don't have kids yet,
it gets even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that I'm working on
a little bit further here with Rob
[SPEAKER_00]: Bergusso in the neurobiology department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really want to understand,
from the plant's perspective, you need
[SPEAKER_00]: your volatiles to be static, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pollinator has to be able to find
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've shown that that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volatile production is really important
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you also need to hide from your
herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, these herbivores
decimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can decimate and adult plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing feeds on them because they're
super toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they aggregate in great numbers and
need a plant to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's strong selective pressure in
both areas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of opposing selective pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similarly, you have something going on
with the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these highly specialized
relationships are sort of tenuous,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, people call them evolutionary
dead ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What mechanisms exist that both maintain
fidelity, the pollinator to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also allow for diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: That also allow for you to change host
plants or to find host plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may explain diversification in
both of these lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe even explain some of this crazy
phylogeny that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What mechanisms keep us together?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I really talked about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think your therapist will tell you
it's communication and I, as a biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell you it's communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure that your signal is
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you telling your partner what you mean
to be telling them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand how they perceive
the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they even capable of perceiving a
signal and showing up and being there at
[SPEAKER_00]: that moment to understand what you're
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is their behavioral response,
right, to the signal that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it give you the desired outcome,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your communication give you the
desired outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there may be some hidden
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we talk a lot about
and even something that Chelsea with her
[SPEAKER_00]: new dean position thinks a lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hidden diversity that allows us to
show up and be present in this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is things that we don't know about
and that, in biology, have been less
[SPEAKER_00]: tractable until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe there is something that is
necessary before you can even show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: be a part of this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, has there been any
evolutionary innovation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the really wonderful
thing about systems like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: some systems that we would call a
component community, is that meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something where there's... Psychiatry
is a unique and sort of unusual food
[SPEAKER_00]: source and kind of extreme food source
because of its toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in unique and extreme environments in
nature, we expect a lot of endemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychad herbivores are almost exclusively,
except for these weird detritivores,
[SPEAKER_00]: but almost exclusively specialized onto
psychads and feed on nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a system like that,
it allows you to ask really wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: questions looking at convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see great examples in the
literature where people have used
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence to understand molecular
mechanisms and ecological mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having some of the first
evidence that there may be some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure what you would call
this, an ecological convergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so because we have this great
component community of not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies but also the beetles and the
weevils, we can ask questions about what
[SPEAKER_00]: it means to be a psychad herbivore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll just thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people that helped specifically
with this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: James was actually just here a couple
weeks ago giving a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He specifically helped me with that
behavioral arena and the tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that amazing video, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people had helped
specifically with the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to thank Montgomery
Botanical Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the conservation garden down in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you work on psychads or palms,
please go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are highly dedicated to conserving
these plants, but also to research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do incredible work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all this work as a graduate student
in Nomi Pierce's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see I was in a butterfly
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I studied plants, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: She studies species interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just want to end by saying I'm
on the board of the Psychad Society,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we send out quarterly newsletters
related to psychad research, dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even have some small grants for
psychad-related research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought some flyers for it if
anyone's interested in joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great society.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's flyers in the back and up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please come talk to me if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take some questions if anyone has any.
Are
[SPEAKER_01]: they also on or in the psychad leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some of the work we've done down
at Longibio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're specifically looking even at
the cholerae roots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not finding a correlation of
them being on the plant tissue or even
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cholerae roots.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still ongoing debate about if
BMAA is produced by the plants or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyanobacteria is the only other place
in nature that you find BMAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that's why it's so connected
to Alzheimer's and ALS and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they find BMAA in the brains of
these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been work where they've
grown the plants in sterile conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: without the presence of cyanobacteria and
find that they still produce BMAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that there's sort of like
sequestering, I guess, to use an insect
[SPEAKER_00]: term, of BMAA in certain tissues,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be more than the cyanobacteria
can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dennis Stevenson, who's a good friend
and on my committee, really strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: believes that there's been this horizontal
gene transfer from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, I love him,
so I sort of believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and you can probably attest the
difficulty it would be to grow something
[SPEAKER_00]: without cyanobacteria getting into it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a problem with thinking
about that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason that we chose BMAA at
Longibyo to grow the bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence and absence of BMAA is because we
thought that BMAA would have more effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on bacteria than the MAM glycosides,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are finding interesting stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of growing bacteria in the
presence and absence is saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I watch this community of bacteria
change over time with BMAA in the system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they using BMAA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see BMAA change?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's concentration change in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding how exactly BMAA may have
something to do with bacteria is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have the answer for you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's potentially great
medical implications for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the connection with
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have the answer for exactly
what it might be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within my species, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in every one I've ever tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tested quite a bit across Xamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things I'm doing
here with Chelsea is looking at other
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes as well as the volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypes across the phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not common in Xamia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is found in one other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in two other species of
encephalitis, which are super million
[SPEAKER_00]: years diverged in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, one of the things I didn't
have a chance to talk about is I've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: further because I'm looking at this idea
of coevolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the one that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to call it the blue
species, 1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done now another species because
you have to use live weevils for this to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut their heads off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since there's only two that I can
do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this one, this plant produces
vastly different chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weevil responds to this is methyl
salicylate, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cannot perceive the other host
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this weevil cannot perceive
1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this weevil cannot perceive methyl
salicylate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not common within Xamia,
1,3-octidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is common within the larger,
or not even common, but does exist within
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger group of cycads.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how to name these
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might come out incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed curious to me that there is an
order of magnitude difference between how
[SPEAKER_01]: much the ovulate cones produce versus the
pollen cones produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was curious was the weevils go
out to the pollen cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, is the new amount of
octidine produced by the ovulate cones,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it really an attractant or are they
just moving out because there isn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the octidine in the ovulate cones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the ovulate cone producing something
else that attracts the weevils to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that kind of gets at two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is insect tracking and insect
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're an insect and you have
to travel a long distance, your first
[SPEAKER_00]: connection is volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing that tracks you from a
long distance until closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually when visual signaling
kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, you land and there's
tactile signaling and boostatory receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: on the little legs and stuff once they get
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, because these are dioecious
plants, you should see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like these big bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weevils have to get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're sort of pushed out of
that because of that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how they find the other one,
they're likely still looking for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: smell that may be at a lower signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cones, their only other tracking
would be sort of a visual signaling to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the female cones from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons I want to
work with Rob Reguso is to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's thermogenesis
involved, which means that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and there's even thermal
signaling that's involved that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that the ovulate cones are
acting as an attractant at that lower
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's possible that it's just completely
by mistake and that the pollen cones act
[SPEAKER_00]: as an attractant at a lower level and a
repellent at a higher level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really all about men.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so sick of living in a world where
it's all about men that I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that the woman's making a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that data to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done like sticky traps near pollen
cones or ovulate cones and then sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: traps just sort of like in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ovulate cones do get more insects
on the sticky traps than the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw how many hundreds of insects are
on a pollen cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden it's just like a burst of
weevils that are out and flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could totally be by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in nature, like that picture I showed
in Panama, some of these like you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up and seeing like a bunch of
cycads really close to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to travel quite a ways.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are they.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is true that in all cycads that the
females have a lower level of that in all
[SPEAKER_00]: cycads we know that the the patterning is
the same and it's at the same time and
[SPEAKER_00]: that females produce less heat and less
volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even if you're like correcting for
size and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so if you think about you're an
insect, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cold blooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any heat is going to allow you to just
warm up your flight muscles, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make you more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same as like a chemical
chemical process that you would do in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic chemistry with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things just start like bumping around and
moving around more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe unquestionably thermogenesis
has some cue for the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is that you can you can
elicit this behavior in both the thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: that were studied before and the weevils
that I've studied here, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the temperature,
if you recall, I showed that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 30 minutes before the volatile
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we don't see the behavior really
starting to happen until that 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, of course, like is a little window
of time, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a massive window of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I think that unquestionably
thermogenesis has something to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: just because the weevils will become more
active and they'll be more able to fly and
[SPEAKER_00]: more because these guys don't like they
don't fly really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even play dead when you're
working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sort of like I mean really it's
kind of adorable and they lay there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while before they get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature there's no way that you can
have such a strong signal as a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it not have some some impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that you can create this
behavior based just on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, temperature also affects
humidity, which affects all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of what I want to work out
is like what are all of the signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the time we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to Shayla.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone, she's around.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has her office up on the fifth floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can come talk to her any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also welcome to come talk to her
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks again.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
